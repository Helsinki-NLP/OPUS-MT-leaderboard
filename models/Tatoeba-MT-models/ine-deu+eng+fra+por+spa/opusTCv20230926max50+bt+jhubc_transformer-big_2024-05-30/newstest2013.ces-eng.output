Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policies with the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, describes such fraud as a myth that election fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die after a lightning strike.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 that make the process of election or enrollment more difficult.
This phenomenon saw a boom after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states were added.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws restrict the period for early elections, invalidate the right to register on the electoral list on the day of the election and deprive citizens with a criminal record of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state had asked voters to present a photo ID.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States ratified the Indian Constitution.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other states.
In the past two years, bills in 34 states have supported such laws to force voters to submit photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not own a photo ID issued by the government office of their state.
In addition, about five million new voters did not have such identity cards in 2012.
In addition, obtaining the required ID often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new constraints are disproportionately affecting young people, members of minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income under $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their propensity for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who elect Republican candidates to use the cards issued by those clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required a nationality certificate in the elections.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have passed laws that require voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the democratic side.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states voted to repeal voter registration on election day.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, campaigns to register voters helped register about 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% decrease in the number of new voters registered in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African Americans made up 33% of voters who voted in advance, even though there were only 13% of African American voters in that state.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Democratic governors blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General even intervened.
The damage has been partly reduced.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undeniably make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics speak primarily of the presumption of approved laws and consider them a clear attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The Brennan Center’s 2011 report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electorate necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to pass an examination or not?
The PSA test often yielded erroneous results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this further increased the hesitation of the men who were already so hesitant to go to the examination at all.
To be examined or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the USA have shown a high level of contamination between the test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, found a difference in mortality between the patients who underwent the examination and those who did not.
This study also showed that after a 12-year gap, those who did not go to the test had a 30-40% higher risk of metastases.
Therefore, I recommend exams from the age of 50 or 40 if your immediate relative has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also the most vulnerable.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and those types that are unstable.
Therefore, it is necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
Rather, we will propose them to carry out active supervision and, if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly, and with greater precision, we set criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not.
However, I recommend taking the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA examination.

Prevention of Diseases
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle principles seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if everyone eats healthy and moves enough, up to 30% of cancer cases can be prevented.
“If everyone stopped smoking, that figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian cancer research company.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Some percentages are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, although the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancers.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
“There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Ten years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight (kg)
According to the SCC, physical fitness and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancers, oesophageal, pancreatic and uterine.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrients
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
If consumed too much, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid consuming foods for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by eating, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“They can cause damage to the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet drawn clear conclusions.
Studies focusing on vitamin E are contradictory according to the SCC.
Although one study suggests there is a lower risk of prostate cancer, another study suggests an increase in prostate cancer.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on the importance of talking about his concerns and precedents from the family with his doctor.
"Submitting an examination doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs Boson Examined
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson sparked a legitimate upheaval last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And it is also the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
However, physicists do not yet have 100% certainty that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have an entirely new particle at our disposal that is very similar to the Higgs boson as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the big physical congress in Kyoto is more of a confirmation, but all the data is still missing so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume it's the Higgs boson, because the risks of mistakes seem small, and let's look at what's really going on.
There is an unquestionable law in this world, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly constitutes them.
It also divides physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently adhere to Pauli’s principle.
And at the other end are bosons, vile anarchists, who value nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can be at the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the mesons, which we leave here unnoticed, and the "power particles", with which the great forces of nature are spread and with which the way of Higgs's bosons is the most common.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of an electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in that particular place, similar to a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) arises, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "carriers of force".
A more stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, but the difference is that another field, the Higgs field, needs to be "disrupted" to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, very high energy values must be achieved, just as with the frozen level of the pond, which is only lightened by a very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as an accelerator in the CERN lab - a large hadron accelerator with matching bundles is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
The electromagnetic field does not react with all particles or materials.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on the refrigerator.
And the same is true that not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do so have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let's look at it) do not.
And Mrs. Nováková asks, what are all these researches for, what are they "bringing us"?
From the point of view of science, it is a validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to undergo an examination of any inconsistency between observations and predictions of SM.
In addition, not a few physicists literally want to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and fill some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge shortcomings, does not bring any clarification of gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of space matter (again ouha!).
However, the CERN facility has not yet revealed such contradictions.
Answers
The responses of these researches in the daily life of Mr and Mrs Novák can only be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
Look: at the very beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell’s laboratories had no idea of the revolution that their work would bring about.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a "laboratory toy".
Just imagine it...
And in addition, the application can also result from all the tools that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle initially did not plan to do so, now serves as the “eye” of all digital cameras in the world and won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... <0x7C> Le Devoir
Through its Commission for a Decent Death, Quebec has recently been involved in a delicate end-of-life issue.
The debate should continue shortly and at the same time a bill is being prepared.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look at the issue.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years to live and it's seven," he says without emotion on his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its job: immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet on his own or just to eat on his own.
Resigned, he looks at the deliciously-looking breakfast and agrees that we will help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop at him, brings him medicines, offers a bath.
Courage for ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
“All your life, you learn that men urinate,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of which person," the psychologist says.
In the opinion of a number of people engaged in palliative care, crucial moments take place in the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter a home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care are all suffering from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who take care of them does not provide them with so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "of suffocation in full consciousness".
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I don't have any desires in my life anymore," she says, and then she lets us put on her breathing apparatus.
However, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the coming days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like, which occurs if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one bed of palliative care per 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, you can give him, for example, a pinch of brandy or pepsi, according to his taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night they brought a beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will have a beer in honor of his deceased father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, days pass one after another, but they do not resemble each other.
Alongside a thirty-nine-year-old man who rejoices at the last meeting with his family thoroughly laid on pillows while drinking in his honor, a thirty-six-year-old man tragically dies surrounded by his parents, his wife, and two young children, in order to try all of them.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds, which are designed for people with cancer under 45 years old," says Dr. Christiane Martel with concern.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois’ home come from their homes, and 47% come from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is designed to alleviate the suffering as soon as the patient reaches the final stage of his life, whether it be at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal Area, specialize more less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental inaccessibility of health care in Quebec that has led a number of palliative care specialists to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed by top palliative care professionals such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they show their disapproval of such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before it is possible to agree to euthanasia.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency room in enormous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients will not be asked to be killed because they are not receiving proper care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists take care of their patients until the last minute, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
Hopes for Hélène Richard's survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was finishing treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care.
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when a team of palliative paws relieved their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Grand Montréal area, patients are preventing pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use a palliative sedative, which sleeps the patient until the moment he dies, whether it is a shock or if the sedative is given to him permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who is not relieved of pain will have an increasing chance of accessing palliative sedatives.
Those who are not given sedatives always say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to give me euthanasia,” it means “I want you to get rid of my pain.”
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing “system” in which construction, civil servants, politicians, unionists, and mafias are mingled.
This "sector" came to Quebec taxpayers very expensive, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has collapsed since we took the crucial measures," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It triggered a scandal in 2011 based on a rigorous investigation into money laundering in connection with the Quebec road construction contracts, which then-Liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after long delays.
The Duchesneau report confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party funding and corruption of government officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Department of Transportation has saved $1 billion in contracts,” he says, when some people have kept their instincts at bay to get a share in them!
Charbonneau’s commission “has already led to the resignation of two mayors,” he added, hoping it will succeed in “discovering the cunning of some people.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Standing Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also involved in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police "Marteau's crew", who since 2009 ensured that the Montreal "money pipeline cartel" significantly mitigate the inflating of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and charged a number of municipal representatives with fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban village.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just stepped down as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal accusations have also been received by Montreal transport engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of procurement.
During those years, he himself devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he had obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related broker, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was a candidate.
Since 2000, Zambito has been generous to all parties and has donated more than $88,000 to provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal search for finances for former Liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with pipelines, the prices of which have been overrun
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surprisant, a former transport engineer, described it in very detail before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations for trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with money supply.
Other public officials in the transport sphere admitted that they had their rewards paid for overvalued invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-tasking.
The mayor's organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of shamelessly closing his eyes to the parallel budget that brought dirty money to his treasury.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been campaigning since 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the midst of a thriving real estate business.
70% of Dirty Money in Election Campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says he is “dragging through the threads in an attempt to understand the functioning of the ant-promoted system to stop gangrene and catch the culprits.”
The process is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the phase of wound cleansing, but it is necessary to set up our own investigative unit in Montreal and ensure supervision so that these dubious practices cannot go back.
It's like he's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially concerned about the role of "ambassadors informed about this scam" if they did not dive into these chakras!
He estimates that 70% of funding for Quebec’s election campaigns comes from dirty money, and ironically adds, “I’ve heard it’s just a faint decoction of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but it will not solve the situation: "Until strictly restricting election spending, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
He proposes a comprehensive control of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We can no longer fall; if we focus boldly on the essence of things, we can rebuild on a more solid foundation and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story blurred the picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends anyone who mocks him to look at his own courtyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you and PSG have taken a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all the individuals went into each other, or a completely new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come to us.
Every day I get closer to them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
In games, it’s easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
I'm not losing my mind.
From my beginnings in the preparation at INF Clairefontaine to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved by degrees.
You are therefore taking advantage of the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The strengths of this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me has a greater taste in the game and wants to give maximum performance.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the right word at the right time?
Sure, sure.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in the first league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won many titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
I had a soothing conversation with him in January.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
Lyon took the lead in the first league.
But we remain in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have moved very easily to the eighth final.
What is your goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for high-quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying team first before Port, so we can play in the retaliation of the eighth final at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
In order for Paris to become a great European club, it must win titles and enter history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to achieve this goal.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
Last season we missed it a lot.
“We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you are a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even better season.
I think it's going to work this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are looking for a title, I think we have the weapons to defeat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is not uncommon to expect a lot from us given what has been invested here and what kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
It’s a fact that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there’s still something to blame in the newspapers, it’s not very pleasant.
You ask yourself what more people can ask for from you.
Of course, you can’t win 4:0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set our game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved that we can play.
Take a look at Manchester City, which hasn’t been in the eighth final for the second season, and they’ve also invested huge amounts of money!
Given the amounts invested, you could expect to have an advantage over the other 15 points!
This offends other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which did not succeed much last season, moved to the next phase with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that despite all the difficulties we have managed to win.
PSG seems to have relied on Zlatan Ibrahimovic in everything.
It is good that it is said that there is "dependence on Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's a League One star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
We respect people and players in our team.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has accomplished is truly exceptional.
This led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow next to each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to the injury, I could not play the way I imagined.
But I experienced it, and I came out stronger.
Today I am able to play good games in the team.
That’s what I’ve been hoping for since I joined the team.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our performance exemplary.
How do you see Didier Deschamps’ first months as head coach of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in the qualification for the MS.
The coach selects strictly, is close to the players and is able to excite for the win.
So was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings our team to Brazil.
Is the rematch (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This game gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
“Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system based on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euros...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin first reached a maximum of $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, today it is moving at the limit of about ten dollars (an overview of the prices is available on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was released in October.
Bitcoin refers to "most successful virtual money", "competitive dollar and euro" and "current money period".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is used as "credits" for progress in a video game, which a person gains through the game or which he can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority monitors and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are bookkeepers of current accounts, controllers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses using email.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information set related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, the solver of which, like a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is the stage of cutting a file; i.e. transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then they "cut" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that provides a particular print (value zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction will then appear indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the imprint.
If the user would like to pay twice the same money very quickly (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each has a different imprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is divided regularly into two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but it can be divided by up to one hundred million, so there is room for margins.
The difficulty of a given task also increases with increasing levels of computation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been hacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
“The hole used is not about the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But this also applies to cash.
Significant players like Wikipedia are refusing gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not take place.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who is involved in converting bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but uses a Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up for merchants, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to give an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement towards questioning hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
“Before Bitcoin is implemented, it will take a while, but 2013 could be crucial,” he predicts.
In addition, the ECB’s report envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are currently considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We've left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside suffered the most damage, which we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, have lost 88 killed soldiers, and all those wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but they are often the countrymen who deny the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they were joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the peaks of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to the French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by air escort helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable progress between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
The Kabul was empty at the time and the land was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their takeover of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these villagers, who were completely controlled by al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved until now.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban all agree to try to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main ranks of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seized state land, sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and exploited huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never even at war.
From what I've heard in the campaigns, people are longing for a government that they won't make up thieves.
Many young people want to leave the way those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity leave: capital leakage is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its associated ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they became acquainted with the modern world and were fascinated by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given work, they do not want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, loves mobile phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that will be at the head of it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias, which will be beyond the control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralization following the pattern of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which has existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, since the 1950s and earlier, the country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been able to rebuild, no dams are working, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of wars, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There are rumours that Afghanistan has a huge mineral wealth.
And that only gave rise to the feeling that the Western states were only here to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without means to transport raw materials across mountains, however, no mineral mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine and have given international archaeological teams (supported by the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist campus to retain their role as the most important employer in the entire province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of common types of assistance: girls’ and boys’ lyceums, French departments at universities, the French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "Getting Hearts and Souls" has been working, trying to reconcile the difficult task of aid and military activities, within which the service of "civilian-military steps" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but achieved the succession of steps in the region due to the innumerable French organization.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped to mitigate the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forestry, fruit trees, protection of the soil and expansion of arable land.
What memory do we leave behind after <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion in military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often at altitudes above 2000 m.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free these farmers from insurrections led by foreign groups, they wish, in their words, to obtain a small amount of civil aid in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly affected by them.
Difficult work on the Egyptian constitution
President Muhammad Mursi is playing another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the promulgation of a constitution, which temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, irrespective of everyone else's opinion, that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave this assembly two more months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative only further strengthened the fragmentation of the country.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president remains in his “autocratic delirium”, continues to “break his word” and “step the law”.
His supporters, however, assure that it is a means to overcome the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum will be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify article by article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy while the whole country is upset by the protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor.
Especially because this swiftly organised vote puts the Egyptian people ahead of an ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or I will retain unlimited powers", which should otherwise end once the new constitution is approved.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 MEPs of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the proclamation of the constitution, they knocked on the door with the fact that they did not have the opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their move.
In order to achieve sleep capacity, 11 people from the ranks of substitutes were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further suspended the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... the hour of prayer, when some members of the committee held the view that the hour in the meeting room was not set correctly.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject matter of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and stipulates that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term "principle" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for the rest of Egyptian society.
“Hypocriticism,” argue the liberals, who see in it only a vocabulary problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the al-Azhar University with an advisory role, in particular on issues of checking compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "persons called to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
The beginnings of theocracy can be seen in this.”
The fears of liberals are even more aroused by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there has been no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulamites, but university workers, many of them graduated in French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be contradictions with regard to the interpretation of Article 220, since the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question may arise to what extent civilian judges are competent to express themselves.”
The text approved yesterday has been heavily criticized, in addition to the religious pages, because of the expanded powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in the number of Muslims compared to the previous regime.
Another controversial point: the powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military representatives, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
In addition, the military courts will not ban the use of civilians, as demanded by the human rights association.
These associations speak of their doubts in the context of the text, which they consider to be anti-freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to make a televised speech last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then protest on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy sites, the navel of the world and the sea from a saturated solution of salt
The promised land combines the greatness of Biblical truths, modern comfort and the inviolability of nature.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worshiping the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will descend upon all who enter this “basin.”
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers will follow the Way of the Pain or the Cross of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the judgment was held, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of the Tomb of God on the Mount of Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the anointing stone and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built at the place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which they made a cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for Jews - the Wall of Lamentations, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, here people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Make a path in a vertical
The ruins of the fortress Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruin is located on the cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are engaged in mountaineering can get to it by their own forces.
The rest will be transported by cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists to this ski paradise from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You can’t visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
His paintings are widely represented by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Spa Museum, which presents to visitors several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with figurines of spa users and spa caregivers of the time.
Caesarea is worth a visit to the unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops here.
Admission is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum – the Yad Vashem Museum in Tel Aviv – tells the story of one of the most dramatic parts of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go inside – and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the children of the Jews, and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Improving Your Health
The three main spas in Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can swim even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The Dead Sea is by the way the most peculiar sea in the world, located at the lowest continental point of the planet - at the level of 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps on the surface even people who can not swim.
The surrounding countryside is unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and healing mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure the smelly nerves.
Touch the mysterious past of a long time ago
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through them.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love the strollers by the lanes, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you squeeze yourself against the walls in the alley of "your" sign, luck will favorably favor you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "get" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully refurbished theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, by word of mouth
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
On the way, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
There are mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram and in the city of Haifa there is the only subway line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city with the upper one.
It's basically an underground cable car.
Traveling by all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive for 1.5 hours with a transfer.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on the Sabbath.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, he stops working in markets, shops and in public transport.
And Sunday morning starts the working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you only get kosher meals: except for pork, seafood, fish without scales and meals that contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various types of sauces, ground beans balls - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israel.
On the other hand, there are a lot of fed cats, which gracefully "walk according to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Leading cats love populated places and are eager to indulge in any kind of goodness.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And renting a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Explained numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To get to know the country and rest most citizens came from the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa waiver on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce in Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language exams, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling "falsified" certificates
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, a law came into force that required every migrant to pass the Russian language test.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sectors.
However, the FMS promises that over time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the fundamentals of law.
Language proficiency will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and renew a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply to people who have successfully obtained a certificate and obtained an academic diploma until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Use, Condemnation and Protection of Rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; as of today, more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the question many times in the press: and what does it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First and foremost - according to the representatives of the migration services - this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from the result of "slavery work."
Many people today are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, chairman of the board of FMS Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should start before they leave.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in emigrants without a profession, without an education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language, says Sebelev, the future migrant is condemned to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "recipe" to terrible, tight shelters in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will suffer for 12 months without food and documents.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their homeland, but on arrival they will be defrauded, they will confiscate their passports, they will not pay the promised wages," confirms MS Tolib Sharipov, the head of the main Tajik labour migration administration.
Don't freak out!
The less so is the fact that many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get to, but they do not even have experience with the given work.
Of course, it is not their fault, but rather their misfortune: only very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least an adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, shoes and equipped for school.
As children reach productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the language test law, human rights defenders point to one important point.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't pass the exams or get any other official job.
In the meantime, the majority of migrant workers live illegally in Russia, just as they did in the past.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry Banned"
Many of the incoming workers say that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization, in addition, costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and that leads to cases of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Chuschadamov, a Tajik citizen, told reporters about his experience.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy yourself a painting."
On the first day of the law on language, it was found that it is not only the documents of registration of migrants that are false.
FMS employees have already seized several false certificates of passing a language test.
Counterfeit documents are printed on ordinary colour printers.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, in the hope of making it easier to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times the amount of taking the official test: it will cost the migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task in the near future is to secure the system against corruption, so that workers can not simply buy documents, both government officials and human rights defenders agree.
So far, the government has promised foreign workers who failed the tests for the first time, the time it takes to take a Russian-language basics course.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not put the illegal arms market into circulation
The proportion of criminal offences with the use of legally held weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia is presenting a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the response of the government authorities to recent events: cases of shooting at weddings that went by without victims, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinograd, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age at which a license to carry weapons can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaj, who promised that changes to the arms law will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by the way of "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while in the same period a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tighter legislation in the field of civilian weapons will not allow the perpetrator to switch to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c, who worked for ten years at the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of pages that accept orders of weapons
The first of them - "military or military way", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes both theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of the authorities involved in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" are being sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It's been proven that some of the fires were deliberately set up - to cover up the gap," the former soldier says.
According to Barance, weapons manufacturers are also making their contribution.
“Currently, private arms companies are emerging, which are not competitive on the international market, and they are eliminating the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow,” said the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of guns and vending machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small production, and there's the mafia that organized their smooth production," the former soldier explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have summed up the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists dismantled the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons found themselves on the black market "due to officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report said.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases weapons were stolen during their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
A salesman-consultant of one of the arms shops, who asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" have not been bought by anyone for a long time - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, dealers drive for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Through the battalion, the interested person buys a unit, for example, a TT gun.
You order a gun from him and he sells it over the fence.
"He'll take her to the city and sell her for 900 euros a piece with two trays," he says.
"The truth is that the police are in good shape, and therefore whenever they start to burn the plan in clarification of crimes, they will conduct a control purchase from illegal arms dealers," the adviser adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Sellers and buyers most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Testing" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to the "corner" where we would act together.
I learned the price from there.
Military reporter Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman - an adviser.- I have such a friend, but I do not fully trust him.
The vendors on the market are, but there also need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to arrange for his daughter's tooth to fall out."
And now I'm gonna get there through a man I'm sure of.
He also gives them to me because he knows I'm not giving them to him.
Beginners look for weapons in a variety of ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was working to become a publisher on the subject.
The scheme has not changed, in his words.
They gave him a photo album with "everything you thought of."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the soldier.
To the buyer, according to Baran<0xC4><0x9B>ce, they do not offer rabbits in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go to the woods with the seller and we build a target for it.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon shoots well, we begin to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Storage compartment on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to websites and groups on "Vkontakt", where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
“It’s enough to have a set amount of money,” they write in the advertising headline on the website, “Buy a fighting gun or a vending machine.”
On this site, users leave their notices and ask questions.
And the sale to minors?
"Of course, without a license," the user asks "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"Buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently ruled out a huge network of sprawling websites, and people who want to buy a military weapon can grab a shovel.
People crawl like hungry fish on bait, and then they mine coal in Siberia.
Military Reporter and Senior Military Officer Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
I have heard about such schemes:websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment via ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO Right to Weapon.
Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts estimate that you will usually pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Right to a Gun" you will acquire a pistol Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month or a month and a half.
The weapon is shipped from warehouses to long-term storage through middle-class warehouses.
According to the official statistical office, compared to the period January - October 2011 the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7% in total, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices 7, 8% dreamed of.
U.S. Fast Food and Supermarket Workers Strike
McDonald's Treasury Works to Pass Up to a Quarter of All U.S. Teenagers
In recent days, a wave of low-wage protests has risen in America at Walmart’s hypermarkets and popular fast-food chain restaurants such as “McDonald,” “Burger King,” “Taco Bell,” “Wendy’s,” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken.”
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a 9th wave or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
The whole action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries paid to regular workers at Walmart and fast food systems, the goal of protest organizers is to achieve creation in their unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “Black Friday,” when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, seized millions of people, and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some employees at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated alongside unions and left-wing activists from multinational chain companies whose goods are intended for people of the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores only shop at home at work.
Availability and range of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheap partly because it pays its employees little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or handheld scanners.
Protesters on “Black Friday” demanded wage increases and complained that health insurance costs provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn’t match the amount of spending, employees say.
Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, show that if Walmart raises its average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
That’s an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart shifts the wage increase fully to consumers’ shoulders, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and the company should not cause virtually any harm.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its treasuries carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
In an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post, spokesman Dan Fogelman said that “less than five” Walmart employees had left jobs and that the protest was “another media sensation” organized by the unions.
"Unoccupied Treasury!"
Protests continued this week in New York City, where they weren’t targeting Walmart stores (those in the aforementioned progressive city aren’t very popular, and therefore almost not here), but “McDonald” and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Councillor
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and New York State regulations is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually raising this salary, but only slightly, and on average, their regular employees in New York get $8.90 per hour.
No one in this expensive city has a lower salary.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
McDonald’s employs nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work part-time at the desk after school and live with their parents.
Few people see their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
Nowadays, I’m constantly meeting with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live off that money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs in fast food businesses begin to receive at least $15 per hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the sphere of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits governments from preventing trade unions and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, management seldom makes life easier for them.
However, the introduction of a trade union in fast food companies is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, noisy protests also took place in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was a midday rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, notably city councilman Jumaane Williams, said, "McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sickly wages!"
The protesters also welcomed the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must come together to support fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair reward for their work and the economic prosperity that every newcomer deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food sphere.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, although not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flame of mass movement is unclear.
So far, the brain has been able to lie on average.
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular topic of augmented reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the grain of special glasses.
At its annual conference at the beginning of the summer, Google presented a working model of the novelty, and in November it was announced that the application for the relevant patent was also filed by Microsoft.
A conversation with Sharam Izadi, the head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge Laboratory, shows that glasses are a thing of the past for the company’s scientists.
The attraction is the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in detail, what is your research group doing?
- We deal with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far been stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with the finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone there is a very interesting option to control using gestures.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction to a physical level, a lot of interactions are still taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the output flow has not yet been significantly improved.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, for this purpose, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add to the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- Certainly it cannot be considered an all-purpose remedy - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our area about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about gestures, only about such sloppy, short ones.
The gesture would not be sensed by the device’s camera, but by a bracelet that would track the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far it is large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How do you do that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Basically the current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But it’s not just megapixels themselves, but as nuts and depth.
With the current view of the matter, all current technologies are inadequate for us - this assigns work to algorithm designers.
So we need to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So very important is also the speed, the number of frames per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic and the current data streams of 30 frames per second are frankly a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with current, mass-produced sensors being closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects a person’s interaction with a machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some snapshots per second extra.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- There are now three "cameras" in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of a reflected signal.
And the third camera - this is actually a common sensor of the visible band.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or worsen it, because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations carried out.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect system, play with the curvature of the camera location and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don’t you think that when it comes to day-to-day use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it’s one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in his hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful variant would be the "portable" form of augmented reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphones based on the clouds platform at any time, projection display and so on around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in which is their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time also the weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
My hands can't feel anything!
What are your team’s responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of touch sensations could easily be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks has been used - the use of second hand as a certain type of background for display.
Excellent way to record the pressing!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tactileness to these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound rays at the defined point where the finger is located, evokes a tactile feeling, but it's still very weak - as if you were blinking on your beard.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
To think that he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to make a person who is physically located in a very narrow space to believe that he is walking in an open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all such as corners as in clubs), moving platforms.
If lying to the brain becomes the target, then work is still for many years.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers – a lot of things are at the very beginning.
Vku<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC4><0x8D>ina instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrograd avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already prominent figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements exceed the scope of the city, often find recognition in Europe, without reaching all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashion pubs and on vernissages.
Cyril Miller’s paintings, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers of Petrograd, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a remarkable man of the Petrograd avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being an urban man, his appearance on the streets evokes a smile on the faces of citizens, increases the mood of everyone.
Recently, he took bottles in his hand and became a Petrograd bottler, because in this complex role he matured with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking all over town in red instead of yellow or turquoise?
- I chose red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the color red represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although, in general, everything that is slightly different from gray awakens aggressiveness and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at making an interview.
The whole history of my provocative actions is above all an invitation to discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
At that time, the wave of old free unofficial artists and the new, free types of artists I could not understand passed.
I befriended the artists of the new wave, the post-gasoline ones, who brought us to "Pushkin's 10", and the other waves weren't.
It attracts me to theatre, dress, music, to all genres except the word.
- And it all came together in your art clinic... - It was important to me to be at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a place on Pushkinska 10, and before the reconstruction there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, the home of St. Petersburg bohemian art.
There are many born there:NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how <0xC5><0xA0>nura brought with the project "Ear of Van Gogh".
<0xC5><0xA0>nur and his friends sang light songs under plywood, dressed in adjoining jerseys, among them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galician times.
We gave them Tracht<0xC3><0xAB>nberg, thus began his great career, basic education and training gained from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the sound of the Art Clinic.
This is where our employees and regular guests left.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In the year 2000 a survey was organized was in the press, the special prize was "People in our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was nominated, this ended my peak.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are distinctive in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits, in which the actuality and penetration is captured live.
I'm going to have the show "The Russian Museum in the Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, today being so is painful and terrible.
But in clowns everything is wiped out, there is tragedy.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by disguising it as a totalitarian order.
Today, people meet according to clothes, oriented to the external mechanics, not to the inner man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by disguise.
- We've seen you play the city bottler recently. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should it be, if not me?
And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
In the past, people met in noises, the Bohemians loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down in microsociety, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar banknote to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And a few thousand spectators will come to the Stas Mikhailov!
- He's the one that gets the fans, the sexually-social sphere involved.
And 300 people will come to the cultural ground and 10,000 of them will not come, and the result is less management, less money, everything will fall apart.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one fools them and breaks what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures of a collector hanging on a wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
Nowadays, people often misunderstand.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it is from elsewhere.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing paintings.
I am in favor of such a culture.
- Cyril, what's lacking in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the days of proper tsars, it was not so in all, the tsars may not have understood the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner because we need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and lead them on the right path.
Nowadays, taste is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but different in that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg - it is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is culture much more, there is the right soil.
And on our antlers, art thrives poorly.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers than readers, that's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have such a weak layer.
We need to make art a fashionable thing, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with a grant from St.Petersburg
Born in the Universe
The land is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board set out on a journey looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in the conditions of weightlessness or on a given replacement planet?
I don't think the choice is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be mastered, even if only hypothetically.
“It’s Venus and Mars,” says Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (SAI<0xC5><0xA0>).
While on Mars there are better conditions for life, on the surface of Venus temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is only possible to live there at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the problems of reproduction in space began scientists with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments on plants were already carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect was carried out into orbit - a very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to see how the embryo evolved in a weightless state.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the trouble starts.
"The problem arises that this bird must find support, must stand on its own feet and begin to move," says Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev, head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN.
If they don't find support, the birds fall chaotically and make cockroaches.
After 10 hours, there was a complete disappearance of instincts in the freshly hatched birds.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
"Twice we let the birds sprout, but then we refused because it is simply impossible to work with them there," commented Vladimir Sychev, who failed the experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
In the biosatellite "Bion", however, there will be only one-sex beings.
An experiment was carried out with rats that were already pregnant.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the earth, the cosmic rats were born offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult task.
When animals lose their usual environment, they simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Humans, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens rules by abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest threat was to T<0xC4><0x83>re<0xC5><0xA1>ková.
The most precious thing that humanity has is a woman’s body.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive a space flight.
Whether she can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered this question yet," said Vachtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket-space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after flying into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savicka was born, who visited orbit twice and also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, who have been born after many years and growing healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even during orbital flights," says the cosmonaut-pilot, the Hero of the Soviet Union and the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new pathways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydro Laboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, cosmonauts adopt the habits necessary to work in an open universe.
Water mimics the state of weightlessness.
Although for adults, water is a comfortable, but in a way strange environment, for young children it is a natural element.
The small Ichtiandrs seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother’s amniotic fluid and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing, only 2 weeks will pass.
"It's very little for a baby to forget something," says newborn swim instructor Marina Aksenov.
In short - if for a newborn baby the state of weightlessness is a more natural state, then for women the inevitable gravity, an attractive force, is more natural.
In a state of weightlessness, very quickly there is a thickening of the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases.
This can be put aside if the stimulants of muscle activity will work during childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth takes place in a special chamber, in which the organism of the mother expels the fetus.
"And what next?" asks Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the earthly attraction does not affect the organism, it cannot properly form the skeleton or the system of muscles.
A newborn on orbit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
It will simply be deprived of what it absolutely needs for its development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unfit for the environment here," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP RAN Bioethics Commission.
So the birth of children in the universe is now only a theoretical question.
One day, however, there will come a time when the Earthlings will embark on their ships to a distant planet that will become the home of their universe-born offspring.
The head of the NKU: the control of the svarcsystem failed because of the politicians
In relation to public procurement, the Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation, but it is lacking in its application.
In an interview with Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, said this.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think we're missing," Kala commented on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of wrong practice, he cites Peter Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as's approach to the so-called "swarc system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with its controls - is it therefore prohibited or allowed?
"The law has to be set up somehow, and if it prohibits anything, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent an office from operating, which is obliged to go to check and enforce duties," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was that?
This is a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislations and then by practice itself.
We put all of this together, and although the check is not yet finished, we have found very interesting differences - in general, the legislation may be "harder and more perfect" in our country, but the practice itself is better in some respects in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to deal with the application of the law itself.
What can this project do for you, what can it do for you?
It is precisely this type of joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price, in order to exclude enrichment and possibly criminal acts.
But by lowering the limit on contracts, we don’t necessarily achieve that.
Perhaps the system will be overwhelmed with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of legislation relating to public procurement into practice.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is it similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, just as the NCA there operates the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized in a similar way to us, also has a college, they are only formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed similarly.
The powers are similar to some extent, but because Germany has a federal system, so does the Courts of Auditors at the level of each federal state - in this the system is slightly different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal money, represented by state resources.
The public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are controlled there at the level of the federal courts of account.
As far as the law is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is called a model, but it cannot be said for sure that it is better in everything.
Is it because they have better controls?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it must be said that even the countries we see as a model are facing a whole host of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be helpful for them to work with our office, would it?
As far as domestic legislation is concerned, what the amendment to the Public Procurement Act meant for your office, do its effects already manifest themselves?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet manifested in control actions.
Since we do ex post checks, we have to count on some delay.
We are only observing this so far in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool "detection of risks of inefficiency", through which we have driven almost 14,000 public procurements, and we have analyzed them - there, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tenders will be adjusted and the conditions will be adjusted.
So, do you consider the passing of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden to the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that the rules will be "strengthened" and it will not be possible to adhere to them.
Already during the operation of the previous rules, the controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth it, then, to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit a formal error that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called "sweat system" - and what does that mean?
Is the swarm system banned or enabled?
After all, the law must be set up somehow, and if it prohibits anything, even the prime minister cannot prevent the office, which is obliged to go to check and enforce duties.
He can say, "We'll change the law and let it go," but he can't say we'll do nothing.
There are relatively strict rules in the Public Procurement Act as to what is to be formally done - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the correct application - that is what we lack in my opinion.
The roads are freezing, but mostly accessible.
In several parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the time, however, the roads are downhill, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were steep this morning, but places were frozen and also snowy.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it should warm slightly during the day.
Snow has stopped in the region and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Cherry Mountains.
The places were also less visible due to the fog, according to the data of district road drivers.
The R6 speedway and first-class communications are now unrestricted in the region.
However, caution should be exercised on some bridges, for example, where the surface may be frosty and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On them, however, in some sections there are still leftovers of frozen and snow-capped places.
Especially in higher positions, you need to pay more attention to driving.
Pardubice and Královéhradeck<0xC3><0xBD> region
Some roads in eastern Bohemia are at risk of freezing, in higher altitudes and in the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the roads, the Directorate of Roads and Highways informs on its website.
Road drivers warn drivers of frost, it can form especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice region.
It can be found in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitav or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>t, especially on second and third class roads.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitav.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlic Mountains.
The captured snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today it is mostly clear to semi-clear without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blows.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are accessible this morning, but places with increased caution and driving need to be adapted to the weather.
It is freezing in the morning, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below the point of freezing.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
Drivers also have to count on fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the district road traffic control.
The D5 motorway is accessible almost without restrictions, however, increased caution is recommended by traffic managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Pilsen and Tachovsk, however, there may be frozen sections.
Second- and third-class communications are damp and also in this case there is a warning on frozen sections.
Drivers should be careful, especially on less frequented roads in the forest area.
Olomouc Region
Today, drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region have to count on the snowfall on the road.
After the chemical sprinkling, she remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on the way to the Videl Cross.
Roadmen were driven into the field at night by snow, about three centimeters snowed in <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk, according to road administrators.
In other parts of the county, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"In <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk lies the remains of snow in the highest positions.
With snowfall on the Red Mountain saddle, drivers have to count towards Jeseník," said the <0xC4><0x8C>TK dispatcher of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road administration.
Their colleagues on Jesenicka also made their way into the field at night, and the roads to the highest positions are now, according to them, naked and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, roads are unrestricted, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternbersk, drivers should be careful in forest areas where the roads have remained damp.
<0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, Liberec
Road drivers in the north of Bohemia are reporting several hard-to-reach places this morning.
In addition to several places with snow or glaciers, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in <0xC3><0x9A>stek is closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are maintained even in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No operational complications have been reported so far.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by road drivers mainly from the area of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>ti.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for her were at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night clear and frost.
Unfavorable conditions are reported from the main routes on the I/13 road on the border of the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec region.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by the bent branches of the trees, which bent under the snow to the sidewalk.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think the end of the world will be in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarming messages that we humans like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to push the end of the world away or prevent it.
In addition, in December, you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts towards the end of the world.
Can you introduce them to the readers?
This is a national charity event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to exploit the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before December 20, from 21:00, 3 concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of items of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing on www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called End of the World anthem, which is called "End of the World Canceled".
She's already very popular on YouTube today, will she also sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in the end, that is, if we succeed and the end of the world does not come...
It will be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.
All of a sudden, the anthems are also connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The lyrics to this song were written by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák, who also sings Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize many charitable events and concerts...
We are working hard to get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What are the results of the concerts towards the end of the world?
To equip the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ková ístav.
For students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, lecturers regularly come and dedicate themselves to them in activities that amuse and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the means to act as lecturers themselves, so we try to make it possible for them in this way.
Within the framework of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What did you choose them for?
We tried to build a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bomb action" in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time in the Prague Spring, so here we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, would also like to connect it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of disabled people.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as terrible as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on an electric trolley, its trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, further, of course, we drag a large amount of cargo and buckets with tools...
However, until now, it has always been done without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, so I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we recently returned, it was without problems.
With travel abroad, you can compare how people differ in disability, public access to the disabled, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we have just seen in Russia that everything in the East is still in its infancy.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric wheelchair to move himself in the center of the city.
There is no such thing as a preference for a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil society associations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the other hand, do we still have to reach out to more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're still lagging behind...
However, it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, on the contrary, we are a bit ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or disability is one thing, but it is only when we become great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things start to change.
So far, these are rare cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is very popular nowadays, but let’s go back a few years what made you start it in 1998?
I started as an educator at Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in something to do.
And since I am a musician myself, playing saxophone, among other things, I and my colleague founded an interesting musical ring.
Well, over time, as our moderator La<0xC3><0xAF>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity has only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with famous singers and also actively work on promoting the band.
We realized that work that is not visible, in essence, as if it did not exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential for something different to be done.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in a way, everything new is taken care of and it takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret.
But this regret is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary resources to do so.
I'm saying that when people with disabilities succeed, it's not just a shift for them, it's a shift for society as a whole.
Did being a strict boss, as many people have called you, also help this success?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require some discipline.
I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their heads in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the rehearsal twice a week, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
The band The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there at its beginning in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We are an open group, people leave and come, this cannot be prevented.
Whoever has the will and the taste always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fled and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected by cable car during the singing of the band The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free training center STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ko Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million.
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years have free entrance tickets in the pre-sale Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland initiated close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of ESA projects over the next few years.
However, Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts had already devoted themselves to space flight before World War II; but they did not always encounter understanding.
I recall, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld’s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933, presented ideas from his pioneering work Entry into Cosmonautics.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his entry into space in France.
The noted doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major proponent of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonautics and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the Moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a rail rail was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used to start the dredge or to brake it.
Information about this draught is known only from the periodical press.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to use missiles.
The research was carried out by the Cell of Arms Technologies in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustav Mokrzycki.
From the preserved materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the professional press, and the following year, the work Rocket - an air torpedo and an aircraft rocket bomb by the author Leliwy-Krzywoblocky was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Shortly before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work, was dedicated to all projects of military use of rocket technology.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, it ended the beginning of the war.
After the war, other works on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronauticze).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, which contains four more extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowiczze, is proposed the creation of a society that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites were already taking place, and it was clear that space research is a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn PTA became a regular member.
And the following year, the first president of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a significant role in the development of the highly successful RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with access to 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959, two-stage RM-2 rocket flight tests were launched in the Bled Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another development type should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have access to up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the altitude wind.
However, in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and its starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which varied in size for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A had a capacity of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B had a capacity of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C had a capacity of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aerospace Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and formed the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second interkosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economic units, the national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free, nothing-limited movement of private capital together with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of labour, (wages) there is price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer seeks to stand in competition with the import of cheap goods by "stimulating" the price of a competitor in order to gain a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to move production abroad, or to buy cheaply there, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and hence the responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is reinforced by the utter reluctance of the employers to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damages he has done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The ruthless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with the aim of artificially lowering the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give private capital the chance of its own population regardless of social decline.
This is mainly reflected in changes to existing laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the price dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and on the other by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is a growing poverty along with an increase in the gap between the rich and the poor.
In the SRN, there have been public distributors of food for the poor for many years, who cannot live by their own labor.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for properly employed people to receive such wages that they must be paid back to the existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of assistant employees of the Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU countries undoubtedly lead to the same situation, where people under the pressure of a catastrophic social collapse are forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century or to live on starving wages on the fringes of society in the hope that perhaps one day private capital will come to the country.
You have to ask yourself, where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty is moving from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turkish, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African are still working for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media argue that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital of Sverrepa insists that the state must not interfere with the economy through its management interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, but now actually governs politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer, yes.
The evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is criminal, but nothing is criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that, due to lack of funds, state ministries entrust the drafting of laws to private law firms that are tightly connected with industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as stated by the constitutions of the Western type, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now quickly getting into a situation, as described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete disintegration and the authorities have been engaged in violence.
For bribes, illegal gaining favors, and using stones or swords.
The corruption and bribery were rampant without any hindrance, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote" ..."characteristic people did not ask for office at all, so once as a result of this uprising it was to stand eight months without consuls, . . . .
As in antiquity, today’s society is based on a ruthless preference for its own benefit, regardless of the societal interest.
Private capital is no longer, by its very nature, able to understand and apply the benefit of society as a whole.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any attempt at reform of a deeper nature.
The causality of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the demise of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy can be considered a certain pause with the expectation of the next round.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost in the future, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know them from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition both at the international and intra-European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen the capital participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence, nor can it ever" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"

After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there have been many reactions.
Some stand behind Israel, argue for its right to self-defense and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodic waves of killings and who is the victim, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
My goal is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, a glimpse of what the 95-year-old tension (calculated since Balfour’s declaration in November 1917) has been serving in the small part of the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch, we can search for Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who completely autonomously guided their actions, or whether there was someone behind them who guided their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lives of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the head of the octopus (if anyone is still standing above them I do not know, but I do not exclude it) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course. Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought back in the 1990s to stop associating their name with the highly criminal acts they were behind, which have always meant for them the consolidation of power, the increase in wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where the central bank shares are not leading or preparing wars (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four governments left, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore Rothschild's Bank of America's central bank status, began issuing his own money during the civil war, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859-1871 to the formulation of the plan of three world wars by the mason of the highest, 33rd degree of dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war was to abolish the great monarchist totalities of the state in Europe, the second was to abolish the colonial rule especially of Great Britain, and the third was to lead to the reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 to 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury are not enough and do not consume so many resources).
The method that a group of the wealthiest families led by the Rothschilds are working on is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao – order from chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed to avoid repeating crises like the one they triggered in 1907).
So, after they succeeded in starting the First World War in Sarajevo by assassinating the Habsburg successor of the R-U throne Ferdinand, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended abruptly, militaryly and economically unfounded, with the surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for a war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and subsequently the disintegration of the Central European power, Austria Hungary.
In order to facilitate the start of the Second World War, the bankers of the political class had to latently create a conflicting situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating the assumption of the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then it was enough for them to impose on the Germans, the Germans and the Germans strong enough.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds incited the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, already mentioned, created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The outbreak of World War II, whether Hitler escaped from the chain on which the international bankers initially held him, or everything he did was in the plan is difficult to guess, anyway the suffering of European Jews in the concentrations created the prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as Germany's war reparations were meant for World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the outbreak of War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish nation, like the latter, will be a victim in the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of quarrel and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (let’s take just how sharply people divide between Israel’s supporters and opponents).
Who is the culprit and who the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers urge people to choose their own candidates in the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu’s hawk, is a typical example of a de-fascist, international banker-loyal 20% of the country’s economy, a policy that does everything to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan), has transformed the country into a...
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn is implanted at birth with a chip that will make it a totally controlled being.
“And he compels all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that they cannot buy or sell, unless they are marked with the name of the beast or with the number of his name.”
This is to be understood: who has understanding, let him count the numbers of the beast.
This number represents a man, and it is the number six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammed Réz Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron saint of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive basis - she could not afford to throw the shah overboard, as it would fundamentally jeopardize the confidence of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not possible.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later further exacerbated by the fiasco of an attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detainees were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home evoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the loss of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
A film directed by Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that brought America a small victory.
Six employees fled the embassy shortly before it was occupied.
After a difficult journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping with an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of a film crew who were watching locations for the sci-fi film in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by Tony Mendez’s “exfiltration” expert, also required Hollywood to cooperate.
In order for the legend to be credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a peculiar combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a hoax - an example can be Danny's series of partners.
In the film, moods alternate - on the one hand, a documentary sequence from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic time photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were shown in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, a lightened passage from Hollywood, dealt with with irony and slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits discussing the situation at the meeting tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Afflecki has managed to start his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculed actor he became a respected director and even his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third full-length film, after Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film that does not take place in the director's hometown of Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that elevated the director's older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, while reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that occur when the cleaners move more clearly.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in imaginary scenes (fake headquarters on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
Quite successfully working with it, sometimes he thinks something to reality - there everything is no longer so elegantly (a scene in which the impending crisis at the Tehran airport distracts the phone call in America and the chase after the ranway seems quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the frivolity that arises from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic momentum, it is a film that can be watched with a slight interest, to appreciate the realization and retro style of evocative 70s thrillers.
But it's hard to break.
As a reminder of one still alive history in a certain way and proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, but enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces the survey for the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare the competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We have been led to this by the latest event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the leadership of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the law survey.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013,” said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulation also includes compulsory mixing of biocomponents into fuels, which as a result are harmful to nature, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of a dangerous substance, or a directive on the size of chicken cages, due to which
Criticism has also faced a factual ban on the use of the term ointment butter or the removal of classic bulbs from sale.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (both the Czech Republic now enforces the demands of its banks with the threat of veto).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that, for example, top-quality bananas had to be at least 14 cm long in the Union and could not show "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by only harmonising the existing non-uniform national standards, which have made trade more difficult.
The EU has already softened fruit and vegetable standards despite the opposition of some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for the victory in the survey may also be last year's EU regulation, which requires that inflatable balloons sold must be warned that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has cited US research that says balloons among toys are the leading cause of children’s deaths from suffocation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under 14 years of age when blowing in pilgrimage hoops.
Curious ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is quite absurd - anyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead.
Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum amounts of food stocks that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded the established volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey also included the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting grants on request for a grant.
However, these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
“We are handicapped by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain was born in our country, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, he had to pay for full warehouses, which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic’s access to ports.
The European Commission eventually met the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for obtaining subsidies were offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development under the direction of Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mce (US-DEU), specifically they were to go to the drafting of a request for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to operate and develop more effectively across the Union deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the use of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by Member States during budget negotiations.
Emotions among Czechs are also aroused by the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products, while not always succeeding in this fight.
The Czechs, after a six-year struggle with the Germans and Austrians, claimed the designation of Olomouc shavings, but domestic rum, whose tradition goes back to the 19th century, had to be renamed pencil by our producers.
The name rum can only be carried by products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, feta and gorgonzola, marzipan from Lübeck, or Parma ham have already been found in the company of world-famous cheeses, for example, Karlovar jackass, gorelic and trebo<0xC5><0x88> carp and jackass hops.
Pardubice plum and mustard tubes can also be proud of the EU trade mark.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked in our country without problems, I'm not running for office.
But I can't watch the country stealing over the last 20 years, the thieves running around, people's taxes and retirement ages rising.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I was forty years old and an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but you just left for the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying the whole time that I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool for how I can realize my vision.
Therefore, I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
The problem, however, is not only that as a nation we sneer at the pub and at the television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
Added to this are the media that dishonest people and confuse freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
I may have been told that I was paying the journalist or that I was an adviser to George Paroubka.
Let's go to your visions.
You have embarked on the battle for the castle with the theses of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of property confessions of more than twenty million.
You have to change the law to do that.
As president, you have no such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to deal with it?
When I as a citizen lobbyed for guidance to be a free trade, it succeeded in promoting it.
The problem is policymaking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, he deliberately refuses, and that delays the citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party boxing and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, from every side, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me to move forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or ODS, and I will also be against bad thinking.
You're kidding when someone says you're a populist.
But you're not proving it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Some might call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by leading experts.
Without the support of Parliament, all you have to do is sign up.
You won’t be able to do that in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to enforce it.
If I were elected president, there is no problem with organizing a live television broadcast, where I will ask the heads of parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want her.
When there is a strong personality to name the nonsense, it can be pushed onto the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, that was the merit of public pressure.
I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started in politics and I will try to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things on my own, if it doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not doing anything in one person, so I've been circumventing a number of well-known people to see if they would also run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorentz, who uncovered scams with light heating oils.
I was running for the position that people are really dissatisfied, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who went to the polls mostly chose the leaders of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have convened the Senate so that it will be difficult to enforce the changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or guards.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the clean past of every potential party, and I don’t have the money to do that either.
I don't have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 on my transparent account.
Don't you have the money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
Private property is estimated at around $60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>KODA Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant to women, and at the same time fought against evil and filth.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million in assets and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to spend much of your own money on it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign.
Am I indebted?
I've spent $2.5 million on the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors indicates that I'm probably not that interested in my program.
And I don't have to pay the campaign off my own.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what I'm going to get from the senator's salary.
But I wouldn’t survive it, for example, I wouldn’t be able to pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for office.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd slow down these activities?
But it has nothing to do with salary.
As I promised, I have partially dampened my activities.
For example, a travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who would save the Republic.
But I also need something to live on.
How much as an entrepreneur have you been accustomed to taking monthly?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take on.
And if I were president, I'd quit my business.
You can find the full interview in the Saturday edition of Rights.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don't just take place in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 pictures
"This building seems cheerful to me, it looks futuristic. Finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large company, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
I wonder why we still need a library today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-fashioned libraries are being voluntarily visited today, are they?
Spijkenisse, a residence in close proximity to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which are not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago a decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive, however, was not at all dizzying.
And so city councillors realized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely bold column graphs and maker of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calm and at the competition in 2003 he appeared with five books under his arm and a smile on tv.
And while the committee still looked around and shrugged, the daring Maas made his gifts according to his size and ended his activistically justified speech with the words, "Dear City Villages!"
So this is my proposal on the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was completed for 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town gray, which could not yet offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy store, is richer with a bit of modern architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
A long way to the book
First impression: a reader's eldorado under the lid of cheeses.
You will find an elevator through the massif of the mountain, but you will discover real spatial and reader’s passions only when you walk through the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and clear on all sides, the floor made of burnt cabriolet and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally there are bookshelves along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed out space for the readers from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is cleverly used: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a home technology center.
A special delight is the black shelves for books, which are once a lining of the walls, once a parapet and sometimes a railing of stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Architects and construction engineers even sworn in with their heads over unknown building materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials here,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
So one day, at a Frisian farm, we stumbled upon a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years, a millimeter cloth made of synthetic material has been used as a base under the roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It is inexpensive and time-efficient.
Thin textiles last for one, two seasons and then are ripe for disposal into bulky waste.
For the library, the cloth - for the first time in such a quantity - was pressed into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
By the action of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is colored into a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
After 105 steps, you get to the top.
At the end of the almost 500-metre journey, you will be rewarded not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and figs in flower pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the proper humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is an example of ecology, despite its many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled by the earth’s heat.
Although the mountain of books stands under a glass lid, the sun shines inside only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden brackets, perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shading and capture much of the sun’s rays.
The air in the room is very pleasant.
With the rest, they can handle fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an early skeptic in the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as the "long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every city dweller was invited to open a book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
Thus, the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently consists of 70,000 pieces, were to be filled first.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
Thus, the MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young or unskilled.
This is, after all, the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in its decision to accept Palestine.
According to U.S.-Europe relations expert Stephen Szabo, the Berlin team is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
Berlin abstained from voting.
What's that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it will support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without, of course, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, it was NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, from a policy that was so-called U.S.-led to German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just getting settled in their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
To foreign policy, as they have in France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take an interest in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to some extent different from the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large sales outlets in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to intimidate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
Anyway, that plays a role.
But I don’t want to attach too much importance to it, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany’s relations with the US hurt when Germany abstained on both important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding for the German attitude.
That is why I don’t think it was as dramatic a breakthrough as the Libya issue.
Maybe Germany will even get some respect from that.
This signals that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are differing views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has vetoed it.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. domestic policy.
I think that the Obama administration probably has a considerable understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, of course, this position cannot be taken publicly.
I think that differences of opinion are not really as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader line and must instead move things forward from their own position.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take on a leading role in the future and will push Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does it want to take on the leading role at all?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a bigger role, anti-German sentiments arise.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be acceptable to a variety of neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
The U.S. influence in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum.
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and it will make them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is an Armani Polo?
Behind this is the designation, which is officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection as long as it is not prosecuted by the actual owners of the brand.
Even then, it is unclear whether the law will be enforced.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
Forgers only need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.
For example, the brand Gucci will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada they will register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, such as the Puma sports goods manufacturer, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens a recorder with the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, one Chinese company left there to protect the brand Zegna DF Puma. An artificial name that also parasites the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several-storey commercial houses, in which counterfeit goods are sold almost exclusively.
Pattloch’s cases are different, however, and he is proceeding from the authority of his clients against Chinese companies receiving from the trade mark authority the official right to use a mark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
These are women who are hunting rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's hurting the trade, we have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The badge will dilute, the exclusive position will disappear, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to data from market research firm CLSA, with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year, China is the third largest luxury goods market and the fastest growing market.
However, deleting dubious entries in the register of tags can be difficult and cost something.
Driving can last up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Pattloch talks about cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the defendant’s name became a “market reality” after a long time.
When the plaintiff has bad luck, he still has to pay the plagiarist for damaging his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
The known cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sana, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
The Chinese are still allowed to use the emblem, which resembles the star of Mercedes.
The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO’s marking office admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too little staff and space.
But last year, allegedly, “the course of the work process has returned to normal from an emergency situation.”
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22%.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending in the office.
Doing something about it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million requests for trademark protection, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China, set in a row, keeps a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected on fees.
Simply put, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To start a dispute against it costs several times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
The group has been fighting Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
The Germans, however, succeeded in abolishing its illegal production of imitation car parts.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would have forgotten this ourselves, as surnames cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the Munich company’s objection.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg won the law, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will come to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says, “Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the company, they even had to look through a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the counterparty in vain a "high six-digit amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"You can see what that means to us," Wentzler says.
The danger from the Far East threatens Europe as well.
And that's when the imitators get unprotected marks.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This area of business activity has long since been abandoned by the Group, yet it has managed to turn down the registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights; rather, foreigners should "register everything that is worth protecting in any way, even in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of its drama, then it will probably have to pay the counterparty licensing fees for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the contested segment.
World AIDS Day: beating, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Congregation is trying - and in Swaziland, the orphans after their parents who died of AIDS are happy about it.
The story of the connection, which surpasses much more than 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, there’s the dope: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, women’s boats and men’s moccasins are looking for a tact on the parquet and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the vocals of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise, mummy and chase each other.
29-year-old conductor Fieta Hopfa almost lifts it from his textile shoes, combining voices with his wild gestures.
In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
There were 50 female singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a researcher in human genetics to a housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choir voice has a different text and in a very foreign language - Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans after their parents died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already over 40% of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany in the village of Esitjen.
Seventy of them are attending secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees a child a school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "the storyteller" or "the one who praises" in the Zulu language.
No one can speak gaseous Bantu in this space, only sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes also brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an aerial distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Swaziland Kingdom is the village of Esitjeni, which is dependent on the power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some in simple clay or straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have been infected with HIV.
In Esitjen, it can be seen in the small, hectic whole of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity inside them. It is no rarity that they die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by a congregation on a joint trip through Africa in the spring of 2005. But above all, Imbonga members saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but cleaned everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
Initially, it was a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, a choir of Voices for Africa was founded, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitals or hepatitis.
Mosquitoes and itch belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who is in the most affected group?
Syphilis and sputum occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases, which occur frequently, are chlamydia infections, trichomonas, candidiasis (fungus), gout and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively rare among heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of newly infected people fall into this group.
Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are common among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of newly infected people has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were 2,700 cases.
That's about one-tenth less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infections from dirt and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent subsequent consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir earns by singing throughout Germany, some money is raised.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjen," says the president of the association, Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who can make a living.
It also ensures that orphaned children find shelter, for example at some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as old women are called in the Zulu language, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children arrived at school on time in uniforms every day.
The children, who no longer have anyone, go to the shelter of Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the society as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa established a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to have an HIV test.
That's not a matter of course, but even though the disease is so obvious all over the country, everyone is silent about it.
The King with 14 wives
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, it's quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immeasurable lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is also to blame for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that while condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
“Culture is different – unprotected contact.”
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together every two or three years through South Africa, singing songs full of sadness, combativeness, trust in the future and the confidence of blacks that many in the southern tip of the Black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of black people - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already shed tears for many wild border soldiers.
The journey always leads to Esitjen, where the singers visit the children, over whom they have a patronage.
Although this village can hardly be found on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjen, there's light," the people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8,733 kilometers from here, to the pierced singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines here too.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also freezing water, according to three studies published Thursday by the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanent shadow of this planet.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters strong.
This water appears to have come from comets or perhaps from asteroids that collided with Mercury.
But let’s not put ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said Sean Solomon, the lead scientist working on the Messenger probe.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us clarify how water and other essential elements of life got to other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved Earthlings, are taking part in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, images are sent to Earth, small windows to endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new concept definition.
This incision from the infrared image of the Spitzer Telescope shows the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, less identifiable are the pink-colored "newborns" in the birth hall of the stars.
This region where stars form — scientists unromantally call it W5 — was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This alternating heat of dying stars was captured by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The ring consists of the material that the star exploded during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, which is 5,400 light-years away from Earth, a new star is formed from gas and dust.
A photo of the galactic “cradle” was taken by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The star cluster of the Pleiades, also called the "Seven Sisters", is visible at night with the naked eye.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors will stand out better.
In this infrared image, the Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to the observer.
It is located 700 light-years away from the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to the Earth's continent gave this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of unusual coloration.
This "baby" among the stars were able to capture the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope in full beauty.
Saturn and its rings: how they came into being is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
It may be the remains of Saturn’s moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: a vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real works of art.
A video released by the European Southern Observatory shows a Trifid nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triclanic), as the dark stripes of dust divide the burning heart of this stellar midwife into three parts.
In the constellation of Haddon, astronomers have photographed a foreshadowing of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies collide and must inevitably collide.
This birth of the star was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical shortcuts can call it the nickname of the South Windmill.
Image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a cut of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
This 1400 light-years away nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual home dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It depicts a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to new growths.
Also, these stellar clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are constantly giving birth to new young stars. They are 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed only shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our glances into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who used it to observe stars a year later before Galileo Galilei.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to expand – and the views they convey are increasingly deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego from 1947 to 1975.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the inexpensive method of construction: the telescope is provided with a hook at an elevation angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope is located in Texas.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the light flow.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, matches the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists in space are looking for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who makes its computing power available.
A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There is the Very Large Telescope - and it honors its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is supposed to be 42 meters full and composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted on until 2018.
The two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which in addition to them also looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea is to be created a new giant telescope - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most significant impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
He has been providing images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets – especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected since the mission began.
The last preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope are documented in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space early in 2018 aboard the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice on Mercury’s south pole.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have been indicating that there is ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are living in the Biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are living in the Biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Riding the mountains of Taly<0xC5><0xA1> can be called wildly romantic.
The microbus roars along the road with many bends along densely forested hills, predatory rivers and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems like we are in the Black Forest.
However, this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives a Caucasian ethnic group of Talysh, about which not much is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and are very old.
The final stop is Lerik.
This town boasts a very monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
For 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-way.
The fabulous wealth for which countries owe oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that Lerik has a chance to become a tourist attraction.
"Grandmother celebrated the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and we will have the world's oldest people's festival here next year," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Taly<0xC5><0xA1> from the area, who are over a hundred years old. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, she still had a baby.
However, the controversial star of this museum is the sheep shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who was allegedly 168 years old.
However, the birth certificate does not exist.
And since the oldest man with documents was 122 years old, Müslüm’s age seems extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children, but at the age of 136, he still had a daughter.
Didn’t <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov make a mistake at his age by a few dozen years?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the elderly people in Central Asia.
“Accordingly, many elderly people live in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “also in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men.”
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrix is missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact is, however, that people in the area around Lerik experience the Biblical age remarkably often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many people live in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the Fatuljev Museum, on the other hand, believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that it is the calorie diet of Taly<0xC5><0xA1>, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and of which many drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem to be credible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubab Mirzajev lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butterfly that he tirelessly swings.
Eight people live under one roof here, including one of Mirzayev’s sons and daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
There are also two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical snorkeling glasses "armadu".
Mirzaev’s white teeth form the perfect line and under the scarf she hides a long dark blond copy, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so I didn't look good and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzajeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, toys.
I haven’t bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst during World War II.
But everything improved when the paddle was taken over by the "lovely father" Geydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that revolves around the figure of the father of nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the rowing.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the amount of money that can be used for good living.
And perhaps Mirzaev’s long-overdue son is right: “Old people enjoy great importance in our culture.”
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, cared for and they are happy.
Unless that's a reason to stay alive for as long as possible.
The term “human rights” is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Desolated demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the country’s deep fragmentation.
The future Sharia-based constitution is being debated.
The Egyptian president did not spare the pathos.
We need to make a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but above all to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, still hopelessly divided in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's State" on the Nile, handed over to the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologised, saying he had temporarily curtailed the constitutional court’s powers and extended his own to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the American University of Southern California really wants to save, neither the Egyptians nor the world have it clear.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
The 234 paragraphs, which the staunch Constituent Assembly with the preponderance of Islamists has swiftly approved in a 15-hour night marathon, are partly worrying.
As in the earlier constitutions, this proposal also states that jurisdiction is based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal free space for a more rigorous interpretation of Sharia.
At least this is illustrated by the newly added paragraph: In all matters pertaining to Sharia, it is necessary to consult al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in a country with great influence on all Sunni Islam.
This may not be necessary, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight of the legislation, which would bring a de facto deprivation of justice to the judiciary.
There is a lot of interpretation in the draft constitution.
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak’s government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values.”
This is legally formulated so inaccurately that, with the help of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, it means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no paragraph in writing precludes explicit equality between men and women.
However, another paragraph prohibits slandering or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
It is unclear, however, what the offense is and how it will be prosecuted.
Likewise, the wording that "insulting people" is prohibited is dubious.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke on the account of law experts enough in this case?
A matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Mursi will submit for signature and, in his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for a popular vote.
"The Revolution is Back"
For several weeks now, the opposition has been forming against the Islamist exaggeration.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual clash on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the constitution before it came into effect.
"The revolution has come back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahí, who ranked third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradei, said the bill belonged to “the garbage dump of history”.
Through a short message service, Twitter accused Mursi's supporters of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a protest, but with caution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the University of Cairo.
She was attended by many disguised women and supporters of Salafists who shouted: “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They cried out to Mursi, "Clean the earth!" and they said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably evoke a civil war-like state.
Mursi's supporters obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide in the election hours which direction the country should go.
The majority is in favour of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur once"
The enforced constitutional dispute, which should in fact continue until February and integrate all social forces, is being handed down by Abu Sa'du.
Eighty-eight-year-old human rights defender and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or in court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution there are no words for 'human rights' once," he complained in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
Mursi's extension of power to all three branches of power in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president actually abolished it,” Sa’da complains.
Without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which watches the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be his revenge.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian crabfish: the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the local appetite for exceptionally fragrant fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it for a week.
This gives you a scent of raccoon, one of Norway’s biggest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, there's a beautiful view - and there's an omnipresent smell hanging in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and it starts to get cold, the Norwegians begin to meet here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, as it were, the most captivating meal.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General" who is responsible for the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat small pieces of fish and drink a lot of alcohol.
“Some people prefer aquatic than a raccoon,” Havard says.
Drinks can stink.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators, fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses were undoubtedly clogged with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival who was even more wealthy than Norway recently, flock to the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, indispensable, although quite fragrant part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Even if everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14) per piece.
Norway often doesn't get in the world's news - and it seems to most people that way.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with reluctance.
Instead, the shooting is called the “July 22 event.”
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway’s current wealth lies behind the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Its English, as well as the English of most people here, is absolutely impeccable.
We don't pretend, we don't like appearances.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash was throwing away money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had cords tightly tied in their pockets.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on excursions in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat the crabfish," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for something to eat - I've had enough of a raccoon.
Such a lousy burger is definitely something else and it is beautifully juicy.
But the smelling fish is here again tonight.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where a raccoon is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live TV show where a butterfly moderator is surrounded by a crab dish.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is applause and laughter.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps engulfed in aquavit.
Or maybe steam from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As incumbent Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers have been erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent the incoming from getting to work, but to prevent the protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the Presidential Sherpa and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico was doing well economically at the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderón, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence,” President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new leader differ even in his old homeland, the crowded and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered in good memory.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now drive to the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built, a huge improvement over the punctuated and bumpy roads that used to be here.
The boards with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on the topic of climate change.
“We expect it to bring real and lasting change,” says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state MP for President Pen Nieto, the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was pushed out by Vicente Fox.
MEP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected inside the party from Enrique Pena Nieto.
And refuses to express opposition characterizing the new president as a person without substantial content.
He is a very straightforward man, very interested with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a great politician, and above all, he’s a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more apparent.
Nestled beneath highway crossings in much resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in a self-governing municipality are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the army was called in to help deal with the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, particularly acute violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in the desert beside a huge garbage dump.
At the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
At best, Pena Nieta’s critics say that during his tenure in office he failed to adequately deal with the problem of women’s murders.
And in the worst case, his leadership accuses him of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a rugged neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body had been washed," recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were marks on him after the strokes and the post-mortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were told.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, and a whistleblower.
They want you to just accept what they say, and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there's been so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The sherpa that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised to make it his priority for the duration of his tenure in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor," said PRI Olvera, a member of parliament in Valle del Bravo.
But that’s exactly what the victims’ families in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment, says military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of gross treatment in detention.
The hearing focuses on Manning's military detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of gross treatment of Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the brutal treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Prosecutor Ashden Fein at the cross-examination of Soldier Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention in the Quantico County, Virginia, do not imply any detention.
The cross-examination, which took place during the hearing on the defence’s motion to reject the case against Manning for gross treatment during the period of detention, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered himself in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday’s hearing, military prosecutor Fein and Manning passed the forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at a prison in Quantico, where he was held in a high-security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Manning's officers asked questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday about these forms, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "outstanding" and that the overall treatment at the facility was "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of mistreatment, even though Manning's officers directly asked how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about various issues orally and that officers who had visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and suggested that they would address them, but had not noted these problems.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in January 2011 during a meeting with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed a few months earlier in the form.
Manning responded that during the meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the “injury prevention” regime.
The military said it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under surveillance for suicide) to protect it and the safety of others.
“I wanted the detainees to know that I was okay and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so I could enjoy an increased quality of life as I saw it,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday of his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transported to a prison at a naval infantry base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was contemplating suicide in Kuwait, and one day he fainted because of the heat.
He said that not being allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was happening in the surrounding world was very distressing.
"My world just collapsed on the Arifjan base, on the cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, napkins, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against the rules throughout the day.
Manning said he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned the other side at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Soldier Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the accusations he made in Thursday’s statement that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates in the morning reckoning.
Manning stated that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket when counting.
During a Friday interrogation, Judge Manning said he had ruled from the order of his guards that he had a blanket that he could put off, but admitted that no one had given him an order to put it off.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show an officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his nails to hurt himself, but he did not.
Manning said his underwear, napkins and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the case of his conviction before the military court, which is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defense said it plans to make Manning guilty in lower-income crimes and that it will fight the other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the imprisonment terms as justified.
The Pentagon said Manning had been detained in accordance with regulations regarding all detainees detained with maximum security.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, transferring information related to national security, and stealing public property or records.
If he is charged at all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely stumbled across the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" and the other for "Extranjeros".
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn’t know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy."
So later I ended up with the term "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use abbreviations.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don’t have a native speaker’s vocabulary and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and lined up for the Foreigners.
I was thinking about the moment when newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama’s White House this week.
They had the usual issues on their agenda that are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
It wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, although he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, under threat of arms, to relocate half of Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think for centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the U.S. official says something just a little critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans are interfering with their neighbor’s sovereignty.
And Montezuma's children will walk the war path.
And yet, the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we now live the American Dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American Dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat, and they see us as an inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is only a failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they would never have left her.
And we would not now be imprisoned behind a silken curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans don’t like to carry it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don’t feel part of one.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you have no roots in one.
In Mexico, they treat us like Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “interim ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country, and we should push the political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
No, no, no.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hostile sentiments.
And due to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are unwilling to forgive the United States for the way they dealt with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel unwilling about the way their family members have been dealt with substantially closer.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that not every such thing is in vain.
Among the usual useless guesses about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time rockets from Gaza hit near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though it seems that Israelis and Palestinians are stuck in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old orders, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the region’s chaos.
Maybe this will make their fight even more bloody than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this could disrupt their deadly heel situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason for optimism at the moment.
Even if the November 21 ceasefire would last, this week’s fights have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and locking up 1.7 million Gazans in one of the world’s most grievous and populous corners, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently run by its fierce rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists across the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has joined Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Hamas boastful people say that the Islamic crescent is encircling Israel, north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah/military rule, across Syria, where rebels who are increasingly leaning towards Islamism can depose Bashar al-Assad, as far as the Jordanian border, where Hamas is.
Above all, in the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, by far the most populous and crucial Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as a player that cannot be ruled out by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s hardline supporters will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in a box.
Israel’s Iron Dome missile system proved its worth and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as steadfast as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for initiating the last round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively at peace with suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that strikes the West Bank, the main part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protecting the internationalization of Jewish settlements against the ever-expanding spread.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil these treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, would they not fire missiles, as did their compatriots in Gaza?
It'll be better if we hold them behind the wall and slap them when they pull their heads out.
Proponents of the hard lines may win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, do not love Israel too much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than that of all four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with local superpowers will barely help new Arab governments recover their economies.
The fact that President Mursi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may be the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should also look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, the denial of Palestinians’ rights to self-determination creates a barrel of gunpowder that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel – just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already today, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are aggravating this situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody outbreaks against Gaza, which take place every few years in order to suppress Hamas, will increasingly collect a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what the rational people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers are reporting: two states where Israel will cede territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that a ceasefire will give pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, along with Turkey and Qatar, must push for a ceasefire in Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the 1967 idea of a Jewish state based on borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside also need to push for a deal between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has his share on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally hesitant in his entry into the process.
That's sadly short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia’s Ugly Cigarette Packaging Act Enters into Force
On unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body are displayed.
Australian laws on ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging, the first of its kind in the world, have come into force, and the logos and colours of the labels have been replaced by general olive-green boxes with disgusting images of sick parts of the body and the depiction of children and newborns of their ailing offspring.
In addition to the various health warnings and images, the only difference between boxes are the brand names, which are printed in the same lower case.
It is the world’s strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by stripping this habit of its attractiveness.
It relies on studies that show that if people do not start smoking by the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
“Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them along with their product,” says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and changes will have little impact on profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been strongly lobbying against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that the law will increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“This legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on the Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover disgusting boxes two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals to the law.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible setback, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic group that the plan is targeting.
Through a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from the eye, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
“If you’re a marketer in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space to promote your products, online space is the unbeatable place you want to be,” says Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman noted an increase in the ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the "average Honzo".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and did the job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved in it?
British American Tobacco Australia claims the industry has focused on how it imposes new regulations rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for violating new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claiming that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia trade significantly.
The implementation of the SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
It has now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering more stringent laws.
There are a lot of smokers in Australia.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"Just pull out your cigarette and push the box back," says Victor El Hage when he buys a box with a picture of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack traffic in downtown Sydney, claims that the uniform boxes make it harder for him to level it into shelves.
"It took me an hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'Okay, that's the end, let's close the store,'" he said, shaking hands.
In a world of constant connection, it’s not so bad to be bored.
On the last Thanksgiving day, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is quite annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming up with the praise of boredom.
They say it’s good for us (and our children) to get bored at times.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to some screen these days, we have no chance of enjoying boredom.
Should we encourage boredom?
Oh, yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll come back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a fairly new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of Bored: A Lively History (History of Boredom) says (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and showing the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to."
Boredom differs from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there's no compulsion to do anything with apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is “a disruption of the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and a feeling of slowly passing time.”
Boredom can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention” published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who listened to the TV show quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups – they had difficulty concentrating, but were unsure of why, and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or tempting task, distractions can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “like looking for the wrong components on the factory line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and whipping, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people physically alert.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to drill learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit quietly," Fenske said.
We’ve all experienced boredom at times—the delay of my flight, the loudspeaker, especially the lengthy film.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, in the 1980s, scientists developed the "Bored Proneness Scale".
The ladder includes questions like, “A lot of things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do them all.”
Using these scales, scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
Teenagers, however, are generally inexperienced.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren’t at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentage of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that “teenage is a peak time for boredom,” which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, play gambling, or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have debated the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Nerd is the brain’s way of telling you that you should do something different,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn’t always know the best thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t learn how to have fun or drive alone, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate control is passed from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to have fun, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of reach of the constant shrinkage of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly over-stimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain yourself when the noise goes off."
There is no guide to the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and footballer from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state — for holding a few grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was driving with a few friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in a car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - small offenses for which a fine of $100 was imposed - and he was set a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," Orozco said.
But he's a criminal?
In the weeks following the Colorado vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the place rather than the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana possession violations have already been cancelled here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults aged 21 and over of holding a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative Colorado districts have said they will continue with existing marijuana-related cases, and are still accusing people of possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana trades in their municipalities.
“This is going so fast that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads are rushing and regulators in the state of Washington.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a license system for growing, producing, distributing and selling - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Licensing Council.
But as Mr. Smith has admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
“There is no real precedent that we can follow,” he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, comes into effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not be a state licensing system yet, but legal possession will.
And there are messy mechanical issues that need to be solved during this time, such as how to balance the state's directive on "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on the trade of cannabis within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly established research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates from Aurora sent an email to his officers announcing that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offenses for possession of a small amount of marijuana by every citizen over 21 years of age and that the police would "immediately" stop the charge.
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, Northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a more rigorous look.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offenses that were criminal offenses at the time they occurred," Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the rural Mesa district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer accuse adults of holding small amounts.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to reject all ongoing possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state have revealed deep discord among local officials with regard to this large state green experiment.
For district attorneys, it’s a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives harassing people that they still can’t really accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become national test cases for drug legalization.
Prosecutors and state authorities are planning new borders for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will succumb.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana vendors and patients using it that have attracted attention, the federal government has mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are unlikely to knock out the door to catch a small bag of drugs, they are likely to oppose allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana deals to be allowed by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on the anti-drug policy of the President’s administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for the federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana deals, even though it will take about a year for any deal to open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to come into force next week.
“We don’t want to be in a situation where we give someone a license and then we’re going to have a big federal issue,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the municipality voted for, versus what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative."
It is not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother were studying at a university that I thought was the world’s largest seat of knowledge, a modern-day coated Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of attending Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my suitcases and stumbled into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confusing.
Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I had objections to loving students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson judiciously declared that I had left because I was forced to drink from the smashed cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You might be wondering why I'm pulling it out right now.
Just because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students on the right from the center is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and shown to be unwelcome."
They call for the creation of a position in the University Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not even helped by the recently released BBC Two documentary show Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about a student-political event that he portrayed conservatives as freaks and neo-Nazis.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a silver head stick.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are treated as "sacrificial lambs" because of the introduction of higher education.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday's newspaper that "left influence on universities is growing.
“People think we’re like Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who stands behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant", while nineteen-year-old OUCA President-elect Stephanie Cherill says JCR members' approach to people has deteriorated from the center right.
“This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I entered in September 1986, 18-year-old and paralyzingly shy.
Hatred towards the Conservative Party was the most bitter.
A year earlier, the university had voted to refuse an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, even Stalinists would tremble with fear.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students contacted each other and the professors, I was given a taste of the toast that was to come.
I found that not only do professors silently approve of the burial of conservative pupils, but they are also eager to participate in it.
The policy of mining strike, privatization and government resistance to the sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic was brought into the wood-clad auditoriums.
My first lecture was about the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty stubborn.
Professor Pitt, the little man with the face like a cake dough, was very bileous.
"The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The rest of the students were hanging out.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take some basic lessons in French in your spare time, that is, unless you are too busy with social affairs," Pitt said.
I went back to my room, crushed.
At dinner at school, I was sitting alone when I felt a slight clapping on my shoulder.
He was a second year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said politely.
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me already, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative first-graders pretend to be Labourists.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics who (ironically) went to Eton said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was twisted, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're hitting each other, right?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to change into a Labourist and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years before me, they developed as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of those who write her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated the place for its provinciality and pettyness, and for its inclination to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took the position of professor at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to drive from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dream moods.
Even my communist friends have always had the perfect ways.
His wet eyes blurred.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week, during the course of the lesson, when another professor of history in absolute earnestness declared that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing cold inside, I confessed that my "parents were brainwashing" and called them "old fools."
The relief was only short-term.
My father punched a nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I squeezed inside and after five minutes my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a strangled weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and poison in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only emerged 14 conservative prime ministers, but which also hides behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought to this day.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting Valentina Garavani's exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the start of the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but without his distinguished clients, he could not have been written.
Valentino has always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, is filled with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important noblemen, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Princess Maria-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "bohemian cream".
Loving the royal family is not a bad thing.
“They’ll at least squeeze your cigarettes into a great carpet like some gorgeous pop-music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests are entertained abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains Thyssen's ex-wife "Heini" and a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
“Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
He's still a star."
Valeria Mazzova performs Valentina
The designer’s charisma is not forgotten by Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
“It’s been many years since we went to him for dinner after one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were 20 and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he looked and felt his spirit.
All the guests were able to feel important and loved thanks to him," recalls the top model, who started working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
“He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” he concludes.
The Birthday Parade
Gravani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of truly repeated loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been rebuilt into a special seventy-metre-long piece of clothing that offers an exchange of roles: a visitor turns into a model and walks through the passages to observe the "municipality" of dreams she wears Valentine's masterpieces such as the dress she chose with Jackie Kennedy.
In the audience of the model shine names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, "cannot forget about him".
"I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, shirts, vest "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from the years 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' muses.
"I give him preference over others for his femininity and great love for women, because it underscores our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria added.
"I really like the colors he uses, they brighten up a lot and give him a 'sparkle' face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she first dressed Valentine.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally arrived in the late 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentine on the occasion of a celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with bells, a ribbed belly and a shoulder-free top.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow after Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax about fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has the designer's ceremonial dress stored "very carefully... because the dress is not only a dress, it is also a set of memories they have in them".
"King" of fashion
The golden nail of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her 1995 wedding to Paul the Greek.
To create these silk ivory dresses with all pearls, twelve types of different lace and a four-and-a-half-meter long tow, it took four months of work and 25 "boys" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the milestone of the high fashion of the end of the 20th century, "the return of clients from high society".
Valentino, dazzled over the years by the elite "savoir-être", is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and honored with the Order of the Legion of Honour accumulate as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his choice, calm, refined and perfect appearance," admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was perfect, time left no trace of him."
When the princess says...
The toughest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, bearers in the Indonesian volcano are gambling with their life and health as they carry 70 kilograms of sulfur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, every day it has to drift to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and, when in contact with air, it passes into a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulfur weighing up to 70 kilograms, he carries them on his shoulder in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the summit of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but the exhausted carriers take over 40 minutes to climb up the turtle as they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so as not to slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who collapsed from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
When they are upstairs, they make their way around the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, tired of carrying heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little below, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is the company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Because it normally weighs 70 kilos, we will earn about 46,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.8) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually travels three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and in the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhumane efforts, it is three times what he would have earned on the field.
"The daily wage of miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a mason.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so difficult, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason which is as convincing as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali who is a Hindu."
He's got asthma, he's got bad breath, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to collect his tax on it, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, bad breath, coughs all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That’s the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
"I'm going to be working for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he said.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man struck by fate could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, and instead does the work of a carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o’clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop blowing at night and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto drifts into the crater and illuminates his way with a small lamp, which he has attached to the helmet and bought it for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry sulfur from the bottom of the crater on the shoulder of the basket
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanized sulphur mining because of cost savings, nor does it provide any equipment to carriers working on their own, and with such an effort.
In fact, they do not even receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photography surcharge, which, along with a 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) ticket, is collected by the nature park guards from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle, not for people," said Madrusin, a wealthy 42-year-old bearer who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He manages to lift up to 110 kilograms and assures us that he will endure to work "as long as possible" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here 'cause the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and gnaws in the eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in the dense vapors that emanate from the volcano, the miners are so assertive that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is evident from the wounds of their calves, the sweat of their frequent breathing arms.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues dump 15 tons of sulfur into the volcano, which three trucks carry along a steep road between a dense warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik says, opening a wide mouth in which several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty-year-old, also earns by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world’s heaviest crafts persists from generation to generation – crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Illyn.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans are seduced by the fact that they do not have children, for careers, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of the menthol candy ad, but still – or maybe that’s why – the video was massively expanded to YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local "we put a bucket in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that it will be able to point out the problem in a funny way.
Douglas Hamilton, the agency’s art director, said he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfill “his civic duty.”
"It's all about the internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
This is the country’s biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that this is a topic we need to touch.
We knew the government was trying a lot of things like spreading perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like rap composition, to solve this problem.”
1.2 Children's
The one who doesn’t take it lightly is the Singaporean government.
It will spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government’s marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures have had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore in terms of population breakdown is currently 1.2 per child per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered to be the rate of recovery, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Family at the National Population Office, says it’s because of “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“People have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, not just marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and delayed marriage and childbearing, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there have been efforts under immigration policy to dramatically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against population decline, this has provoked discontent among locals.
On some Singaporean websites, there is unprecedented xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s government party recorded its worst election result since independence began last year.
After the elections, an effort was made to solve the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known implications for national economic growth, tax revenues, health care spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate trade.
The Office of Urban Development has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been a great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may promote a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” sell far faster than larger homes.
“They’re more popular, so they sell for days to weeks faster than larger houses.
That’s why they’re so much better for our cash flow.”
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed.
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the nation’s birth rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district in the city center suggests they won’t have much effect.
"People are still stressed, homes are expensive, as is education, which is why many people postpone it," the young official says.
"Let others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old, a young man.
Men and women cite careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force the citizens to have children, Singaporeans have the final say on how to start a family.
What is private offline is private and online
-Privacy.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something of a personal nature or an “area of privacy that everyone has the right to protect against any intrusion.”
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed when he publishes on the Internet things that he would certainly not tell anyone in ordinary communication?
Reporters from elPeriódico confessed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as “something entirely personal” on a personal level and as “username and password” when it came to social networks.
“I wouldn’t disclose my biggest secret,” says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“They’re very secretive, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world,” she says.
"On FB I give nice photos or photos of how we play.
I also talk to acquaintances.
I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine or a photo that would make someone laugh,” he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, photos of naked people or photos of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine fans on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I have created a Twitter account so that I can express my views and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I’m just putting them there,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends,” he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone he didn't know.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
This teenager owns accounts on the networks Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask and for the last mentioned network admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of that because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them were instigating him or asking for his address or phone number.
"If they insist on me or demand it from me, I'll simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
These guys are not strangers to what is now called cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was," he said.
According to Joseph, the victim did not log out of the account.
"You just activated the private mode."
It then explains a series of steps to set up your account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of celebrities in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would do it if someone bothered me or just wanted to.
“I know it’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate of the field of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to be properly oriented on social networks, they must understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform.
“The Internet was created as a means to search for information, but when social networks emerged, the rules of the game changed.”
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and the author of the paper Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people born in the age of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are still learning for ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, on the contrary, at an age when they are not yet ripe for it."
Also, to be - as far as the environment is concerned - prudent, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not think about the consequences.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and teenagers what privacy is is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo the way you posted it to a friend?
Do you know what others are saying about you?
When you mark people in the photos from the celebrations, did you ask for these people's permission?
And one more thing: Does everyone constantly need to know what you’re doing?
Another point is to realize that they have to behave in the internet environment as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
“A person outside the Internet is guided by respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be done on social media,” he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-degree teacher and an educational advisor, explains that it is necessary for parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand every intrigue, they have a good basis to talk to children about the consequences of setting up an account on the Internet.
For example, with regard to age or what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
The Guardian is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule "do not talk to strangers".
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Peru ended today without the issuance of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven present presidents.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of Unasur heads of state and government, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the presidential offices, who initially determined that the document would be published after the summit, said it would be published later by governments on the Unasur website.
They also said the contents were published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several brief press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential meeting was broadcast without audio with the message "confidential meeting, audio transmission prevented".
The small amount of information available to the journalists was provided by the press spokesmen of some governments who were present, but not the Peruvian speakers.
The only document released during the talks was a list of participating presidents, prompting hundreds of journalists from various national and international media to ask for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an email to the media with a “concluding statement” from the summit, but it was only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (ASPA) and even on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, although the press was eagerly required.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with Chile and Peru’s joint commitment to accept the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which deals with a border dispute between the two countries.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will begin hearing a defense speech by both parties to the dispute that Lima launched against Santiago.
"We will take action and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute we are discussing today at this international court," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," Piñera added, greeting President Humala by squeezing the flags of both countries.
Confirmation by the two presidents that they will be subject to the International Court of Justice’s decision was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the International Court of Justice, which ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia’s decision after the decision.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rousseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and ending the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read out a final document in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and action was planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, which extends the residence agreements".
He said actions are being supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organized crime, to improve the availability of medicines and the cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to take joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a winning essence, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections of various parts of South America, especially rural and border areas ... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," the president said in a speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and the cross-axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to better connectivity with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its return to the Union of South American Nations," she said.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region that is holistic and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, ahead of his participation in the regional meeting, said he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to discuss with respect the International Court of Justice ruling on the dispute over the Bogota maritime border.
“It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow,” Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none excluded, nor a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with that country," he said.
“I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortega that we will conduct the talks in the most civilized and thoughtful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieta.
At the summit, EU defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the area.
Members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case really, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, said on state TV Peru that the Europeans "killed themselves during World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, he defended the South American Citizenship Project, which is supported by UNASUR member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already underway among members of the Andean Community must be achieved, but there are still backward areas that want to bring us back into the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian president said he would agree to the regroupment of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states would be reduced and those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights would be taken into account.
"Those at the top never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is being funded in Washington by the United States,” he said in reference to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret the decision because it did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time, “there were reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process.”
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice, which asked him to be interrogated on Swedish territory for alleged sexual offences, while "Sweden's own legislation allows for a video-conferencing interview, which could take place in a large-scale equator."
Correa said there was a risk of Assange’s physical and mental health deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental condition is likely to deteriorate because he is confined to a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
That would be a sign of everyone’s health,” he added.
President Correa noted that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that the purpose of the dismissal with London for
“We are not negotiating about human rights, we are not using such a word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, as Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
He said that “if the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over.”
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation allows, and as has already been done in other cases, this problem will be over tomorrow.”
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, clarifying that he definitely does not tolerate "under-averageness, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of the free press are not we, the vile and perverted politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy at the fact that neither such journalists, "neither bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie dominated Ecuador", and suggested that if re-elected, "it will continue to make changes guided in the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's veto on Unasur membership at least until its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and putschism veiled in legality" because in fact it "destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also said he considers "completely appropriate" his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos' wish to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, in the wake of the International Court of Justice's ruling in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
The verdict is currently not accepted.
"It's a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but the will to walk together must be overcome.
They need to be assessed broadly so that they are overcome and there is an opportunity to move forward.”
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute, which is being settled in the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries dare to make a judgment, however harsh it may be".
Regarding the possibility of running in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term in a row, he noted that he sees this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if he lost the election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
“I have never personally been interested in much, but situations as unfair as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be remedied by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so we must accept this responsibility,” he said.
“If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would quit politics.
If we lose, the same will happen to me.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
“I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says that President Chávez went for scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a recurrence in the president's health condition," he explained.
The head of state of Ecuador attended today the sixth summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
Aids victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when his HIV positive test was confirmed.
"It was as if I had been struck by lightning," he says, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor had tried to "mild a little", but apparently unsuccessful.
The boy was hiding it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own thighs and began to inform himself about it, with such commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the most recent patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unthinkable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and only come when the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and strengthened the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the emergence of AIDS in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "signifies a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate way is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the Civilian Unit in the HIV
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that the scientists came to the conclusion that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of impairment of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease.
Simply put, this means that a person diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "live without problems for up to 75 years, while adhering to treatment," the doctor explained in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report of the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and as of May this year, 187 have died. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured.
Why are people still dying from the consequences of the disease?
"I don't think the problem is in access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
At least for the past 12 years, we have not exhausted our supply of medicines. The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage because they do not know the state of the disease, that is, in the late stages of the disease."
He adds a convincing statement: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection is already manifested. The only thing that needs to be done in order to be able to more affect overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer tests on a large scale to the person who is about to detect the disease".
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to have tests in a private laboratory only because it was done by his friend, and despite his low age, he also got sick with the disease.
“Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather get rid of it three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthy, I exercise, I take medication."
To this day, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has accepted the challenge to share his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISCO, who today, as part of the World AIDS Day, are motivated by their motivations.
"Let them have tests. If they risked, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, it's better. And if they've been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they're accountable."
This message summarizes the motto of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who searches for information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has really increased, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new diseases are adolescents.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question filled with irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff, and health care workers that teens want to avoid, the reporter said.
He proposed to change this inefficient distribution. Let condoms not only be behind the counters, but the hundred be located in dispensers on public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“It’s not about promiscuity.
It’s not even about “paying for beer and motels,” as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already have sex," he noted.
Key figures in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
In Mexico, it ranks fourth in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV-related cases.
92% of the disease is sexual, 6% is blood and 2% is perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people per registered case who are unaware of the disease.
The judgment approved by the U.S. Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt imposed by the bankruptcy in Mexico, creates a bad precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighboring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, it seems that the procedures for restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in a country of stripes and stars, despite international agreements.
Approval of a judgment issued on June 15 last year by Judge Harlin Hale at the North Texas bankruptcy court leaves Mexican firms in practice defenseless against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door for the main Mexican glass manufacturer to the United States Supreme Court with an appeal against three irregularities.
In the introduction, while the judge of the case claims that creditors should abide by the U.S. insolvency law, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceeding provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, it would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
Essentially, a United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, which is arbitrated by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without the vote of the branches of the internal business structure, where the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, Mexican laws allow for this possibility.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for which domestic debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
Moreover, it is true that even after deducting the votes of the branches, creditors - who opposed Vitro in the United States, i.e. the funds of "supposes", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have achieved the majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This fact is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From a different point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 – against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family-owned company González Sady will appeal to the Court of Appeal for a new review, so that the review will take place with the full participation, that is, with the participation of five judges, because originally only three voted.
If it fails here, it will seek as a remedy the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as the amicus curiae department, which detailed the procedure of Vitro under the Bankruptcy Act and pointed out that the company facilitated the state by adhering to the agreements signed by both countries.
In addition, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Clash on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall Evaluation
For several months, a criminal complaint by the unions of the Mexican Air Force against the former owner of the company Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who was accused of fraud, lay unnoticed on the table, and according to the union of pilots, the vessel has already overflowed.
An instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit with the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstructing the pursuit of justice.
According to her, the Authority systematically refused to report to the Public Prosecutor General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this businessman, in which he collected 198 million pesos from IXE Bank on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company from the F/589 fideicomis.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of the association met at the Universidad de Caribe campus this weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge shopping and distribution center with products from "a country with a big wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a living area for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Previously, the Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) had been able to unite the governors of the southeast zone to oppose a monumental area that would partially devastate protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
The end of the ACTA document
A request by the senate, which the government did not take into account and which requested clarification on the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property Act (Instituto Mexicano de la Propie)
As is well known, it happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of it being considered a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run

This series is the first of four identical ones that offer repayment of interest every 28 days.
A Competitive Birth
The merger of leading information technology companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet has created an association with the trade name Competival, which will target the software services market in Central and South America.
Investments in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world champion Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has travelled the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
Reyes had been involved in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior player, a BSN national basketball league player, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or the president of the Portor basket.
"I've played a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was the president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, the general manager of the national team and the president of the federation," Reyes recalled when visiting reporters of the Primer Hora newspaper.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest excitement of all, he guards those reminiscent of his time in Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, when he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or owner of the team.
“It’s been my best years, the one I’ve enjoyed the most because I’ve had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros since 1967, whether as an owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
At that time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent manager," Reyes said.
“I remember Gene Bartow, who was a former coach here and was working at the University of Alabama in Birmingham at the time, saying to me, ‘I have a grown-up two-meter player for you.
You want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me player Raymond Gauss, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon a championship victory, then Gauss will contribute to another."
The championship, where Los Vaqueros played for Gauss, was enjoyed, but only at a distance, because in 1988 he already served as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy’s place in the national team.
“I remember defeating the United States for the first time in the qualifying game in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished quarterfinals, but we should have had the bronze without that Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and scratched the U.S. team that was pretty similar to the one that blew us the bronze at the World Cup.
The team had not only Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team because of the turn in 1990.
The team that may not have the perfect composition, but was able to win a gold medal and bring us great joy, was the team from the 1995 Olympic qualification in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players excluded due to a fight at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his work in various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
Which do you consider your success in the federation to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN national league had up to 17 teams in one season.
What have you failed to prove?
There were things that I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see a contribution in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, referee assistants and referees.
I'm glad to hear that.
What are you doing now?
I mostly listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy having grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, became world-renowned as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, in which he portrayed a man who acted ruthlessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of predatory oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new Dallas series this year, died on Friday afternoon from complications related to cancer, according to the family's official announcement provided to the Associated Press by Dallas production company Warner Bros..
“Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved most,” the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was his wife's representative in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death at the Dallas hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane said in a statement.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series aired, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie aired by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (Genie) played by Barbara Eden and takes her home to live together.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971–72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performances in films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it wasn’t until Hangman’s masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that took him to the stellar peak.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan “Who Shot Jair?”, which was supposed to evoke expectations about the emotion-filled part of the Hangman character being nearly murdered, has caused not only a huge array of speculation from viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in tax offices.
This also helped this piece to achieve a track record.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history after the 1983 MASH series, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin got pregnant with J.R. and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in a nursing home.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on-screen and off-screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have had the good fortune to know and love him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of the second series have already been filmed and the sixth has just been filmed," the broadcaster said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
A cousin from Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as the South Pacific and Peter Pan musicals.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on stages in New York City, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt someone or hurt them in any way," he told Prensa Asociada.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it will be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy".
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
Starting a course that explores the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course on the end of the world, he knew that it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the “long number” of the Mayan calendar, due on December 21, caught many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what was ahead of him in the next few months: Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a budget gap that some call "the debt Armageddon," and the growing conflict in which Israel is drawn, a place where, according to Christians theorizing the end of the Apocalypse, the world begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
When you think about what’s going on in the world today as if you have 30 days left, it’s a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for apocalyptic thinkers.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which is theoretically the latest in history.
At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker holds a course "Resources, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re discussing why these ideas expand over time,” he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
If, for example, nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, a war may erupt.
This month, students are analyzing movies with apocalyptic themes and exploring how they differ from real-life examples.
“I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible, and impossible,” says Vacker.
At Pennsylvania State University’s main campus, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solario, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, came together to organize a course called The End of the World.
“We don’t add ‘2012’ because we always count on the possibility of arranging the course again if the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the "threatening destruction", students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work “until the evening of the world’s expected end,” Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It stretched into two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, who enrolled 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we were asked by e-mail whether there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a religion and sociology student at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
Therefore, apocalyptic, secular or religious thinking is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour before when this could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the date of the end of December 21st.
“Our first project was about Mayan predictions, and we’re going to somehow refute it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old undergraduate at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that dates back several centuries, which people react to the changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has sparked these speculations.
"People don't think about it elsewhere," he said.
This happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who is giving a lecture in the Philippines this year, when asked if he knew of any course there about the "end of the world," answered quickly.
"The Philippines will not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception to the Supreme Authority.
We have the grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there was talk of many days of the Last Judgment, saying that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will end.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several of them said they intend to go to the celebration of the "end of the world".
"I'll probably call a few friends to laugh together," 20-year-old communication student Samira Ford said.
