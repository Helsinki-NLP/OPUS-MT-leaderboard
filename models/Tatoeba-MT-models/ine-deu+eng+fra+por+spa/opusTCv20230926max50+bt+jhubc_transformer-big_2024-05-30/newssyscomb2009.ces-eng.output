Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: 29%
The appreciable weakening of both sides of the big coalition so far and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties have brought about early parliamentary elections in Austria, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) has suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Kurtian hetman Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, he remains the strongest party in the country of Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the <0xC3><0x96>VP, which is losing with 25.6 percent of the votes, nearly nine percent.
These are the worst results of both of these great parties in Austria’s post-war history, and especially among the people who provoked early elections, literally a disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the people had a significant advantage over the SP<0xC3><0x96> in their preferences.
But the voters were obviously punished for having let the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party’s president and former deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
Such a development would probably facilitate the way to the most likely starting point of the election result, i.e. to the restoration of the large coalition of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Due to the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FP<0xC3><0x96>) won 18% of the votes and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% of the votes - however, the Social Democrats also expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the people agreed with the populists (then the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still united to the BZ).
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, is obviously looking to return to Vienna for a national policy.
The Green Party entered parliament, but was slightly lost and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the 4% threshold and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of illegally collecting beetles in India were not solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it had not been resolved, then yes, then there would have been some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the talks that the executive can hardly interfere in judicial matters.
However, he said that in the case of Peter Schwach, who was acquitted and fined, the central government can deal with the local government in Darjeeling, under whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be best for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>er to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and wait for his sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed his views during the negotiations.
"He recommends appealing to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can get involved in the whole matter is to provide the convicted with “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already providing such assistance to them.
“We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and indict these Czech scientists," he said.
Answers to the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with matters, the minister avoided.
"I've already received quite a few promises," he said.
Czech judges fight for the seabed
He will go to a walled electronic map that shows Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, watches the interpretation and occasionally supplements it.
There is a work enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a still little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores and other minerals can be found here, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to the development of a cure for cancer.
The bottom is larger than the mainland
Today, the coastal states have begun to apply vehemently for new submarine territories.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that they exercise the rights they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it has the exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its subsoil that is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
An application submitted by a country to the Commission for defining the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded so far," adds Mikulka.
The world record has recently seen the success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its subsea countries.
But he also won New Zealand - the area of the seabed, which the commission admitted to him last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits they will derive from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be priceless.
Other states will gradually submit their requests.
They can do so up to ten years after they have ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is declared a "common heritage of humanity" by the Convention.
There is no longer an exclusive state here.
Mining rights in this area are granted by international institutions established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, adding that its "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually enshrined."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, it gained the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
He is licensed to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken down there, it's some kind of submarine replica of the Tater.
"It can be mined on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings one such concreteness to the show.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, a fabulous scheme that, according to legend, brought Golem to life.
The German Special Operations Forces were in the process of liberating the hostages.
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in resolving the crisis with the hostages - experts have arrived.
When the situation worsened, special units were prepared, but no deployment was made.
Further details of the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are gradually being revealed to the public.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
According to the statements of the ministries, both experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorism group of the German police GSG9, air forces of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and also experts on logistics from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the scene of the release.
But German forces were not needed, according to another statement by spokesmen from both ministries on Monday afternoon, as the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government said it accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for the action on the ground.
"Happily, this did not happen," said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight of their Egyptian guides on 19 September in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, the hostages were moved to the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
Rescue operations are already underway in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages was under the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there is no information yet as to when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to Bild, all five tourists are expected to depart with special forces from one of the German airline's Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout
The first U.S. House of Representatives dropped a $700 billion bailout for financial markets.
The Dow Jones Index has fallen sharply.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s financial market bailout.
Despite all the calls from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians on both sides, the majority did not find a program to alleviate the chaos in the financial markets.
Proponents desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, urged MEPs to give their consent before the vote, although, as he said, the plan was not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened at all," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than 6%, or 600 points.
Investors feared that the state’s bailout package could collapse.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index had risen to a steep decline after the package was notified of its failure.
Experts are now anticipating further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, it requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Travel agents are seeing an increase in the number of bookings
It seems that winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in the tourism sector:
According to one study, travel bookings for the next month increased significantly compared to the previous year's turnover - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans’ desire to travel remains unaltered.
For the winter season, travel agencies saw a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period last year as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Institute for Market Research, increased numbers of reservations are already available for the autumn months.
According to DRV, turnover for October was thus about eleven percent higher compared to 2007.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which every month evaluates booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included travel bookings that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate of the dollar, travel to the United States is required, DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in bookings is about one-third.
In addition, the Germans are particularly wanted targets Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
In particular, organized tours are in the course, said Klaus Laepple, President of the DRV.
In view of rising energy and food costs, costs are "more easily computable for the client than for individually organised holidays".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money, among other things, by taking advantage of discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so the turnover will again be higher compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Infinitely repeated buttocks, beer from stumps and prominent in cuts from well-known designers.
First time on the beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made cut.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing unites us: we are not even three minutes on the meadow of beer, and photographers are already throwing at us and quickly filling the memory cards - that makes me happy, because I am at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can be friends.
It seems that my cheap cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my feeling of comfort in the cut was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a female cut or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
The special looks at the banana stand in chocolate are only picked by my apron.
One monk reminds me that I have wrongly tied her up: "You are free on the left, in the middle of the virgin, on the right, widowed on the back."
I'll throw them from the back to the left.
"Okay," he says and laughs.
Others don't care so much about subtle flirting techniques and wear simple woven hats with the inscription "To drunk to get dressed!" and squirt on the passing naked ass.
A young man with such exhibitionistic inclinations is named Bob, he is from England and he also came to the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous," with an extended "ooo."
That's what he tells me after you relieved yourself of your drunkenness.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are trash cans.
Bob is therefore one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as it is called in public in Bavaria freely urinating people.
Others do not have the luck to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening they run around the area where the Oktoberfest takes place, a plethora of health professionals who have to take care of poor drinkers.
Sanitizers always appear in flocks - in four they carry covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors of the beer meadow: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the canvas of this coffin of mercy is not seen.
"Only those who can't go on," one of the paramedics calls me in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
Police Release Name of Accident Victim
The name of a 60-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been published.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, an eleven-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of ruthless driving.
He was released on police bail.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began to seek accession to the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the east bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a Railway Station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in a neo-Renaissance style.
The tour guide will tell you.
The building sits round the end of the platforms with towers at each corner of the front, indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once a person gets inside the vaulted box office, he can no longer doubt the size of the company whose westernmost gateway to the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium of the Anatolia-Baghdadi Corporation.
Germany, which was late in the game of empires, intended to realize its ambition to control the Middle East using this railroad, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further into the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
British and colonial units advanced from Egypt and expelled the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And there's bad news for Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a station, too.
In 1917, the explosion of the ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually shrinking and history has been circumventing it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was supposed to meet with one of the leading AKP foreign policy experts, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a slippery ride along the tracks reminiscent of the old-fashioned rhythms of the famous documentary Night Post, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
Suspicion arose in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and metal building deliberately built in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-deployed department stores and power shops, where middle managers in business suits – men and women – meet to strike.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
“The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its border.
Today, we have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It must have done both.
"But there will come a time," I asked, "when may Turkey have to make a decision?"
"Turkey," he said, "you didn't want such a decision to happen."
He then underlined what almost everyone I spoke to here almost memorably said: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea area are as good for Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go along these tracks to East Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a station, after another mostly waking night, I thought of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who watched as this building was built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, for the most part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited in the harbour for the ferry back across the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford Music Director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, September 11th) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district music plan, he founded an excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be up to 21 years old, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, a few of us were almost 30 – we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape-changer) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to engage in any music that was presented to him - either madrigals or messiahs, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often astounding, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged throughout.
How often did Tod tell us to “leave music to speak for itself.”
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it! "
His tactile technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor majestical.
Wherever the music standard was, it was always uplifting.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was a conductor to fit a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years or so, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by either of them – and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply “pulled one or two soaked pecks around the world.”
Many of us will be missed.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (25 September) states that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he definitively left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina 'Flamenco and Life' because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was attracted by the simplicity and the powerful cartridge with which it acts on the spectators, and the consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
The resin can capture magical moments."
Honda launches its bestseller for the second time
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already had plenty of space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
To this are added enhanced engines that increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the lines of the new Jazz are very similar from an aesthetic point of view to the previous model, many changes have taken place on this single-space car.
Innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines are among the highlights.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the first generation is launched.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period of time than other manufacturers to rejuvenate this model.
Although in Europe, Jazz is a lesser-known model, in other markets it has become a phenomenon in sales.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
Since the launch of the Honda Jazz, nearly a million units have been sold in Japan.
The second market was the old continent with about half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims for the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
That is, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2007, an estimated 100,000 cars in 2009, which would mean a 17% increase in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model since 2002, which is 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 pieces for the whole year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
De facto, the company expects the year to end with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007 and a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door compact hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 units worldwide annually.
In terms of markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will divide the old continent and Japan.
Honda Insight is expected to launch in the first months of next year, when it will be unveiled to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its dimensions.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and axle spacing to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
With the increase in dimensions, there was also an increase in the interior space.
This advantage was achieved, on the one hand, by using the new platform, on the other hand, by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the luggage compartment volume - which has a double bottom system - has increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the first-generation luggage compartment volume.
It should be noted that these dimensions are present in the version with the engine 1.4, since the luggage compartment volume of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Further improvements besides external elements – such as LED rear lights or the possibility of a glazed panoramic roof – make it easier to access the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 in the first Jazz model.
In the second generation Honda Jazz there are new engines as well.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both engines take advantage of i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and delivers outstanding improvements to the propulsion system while also delivering high torque at full engine speed.
The first 1.2 litre engine has a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine – which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation of the Jazz – consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
The Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
"Auto bee" prevents collisions
To make progress in the development of accident protection technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, specifically bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the model of flying bees, thus preventing collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Center for Technological Progress Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. have developed the robot in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of public relations for technology, research and development of the brand, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of the Nissan safety shield.
The task of the robot is to strengthen the ability to prevent precipitation in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
Most importantly, however, are composite bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles up to a distance of two meters in a 180-degree radius ahead of BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"As soon as an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the bee's movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all pernicious maneuvers are absolutely instinctive.
If that were not the case, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Lab and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to the direction it is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as with bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from crashing.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and according to that data, it must be preserved.
It does not require storing information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we’re not talking about giga or mega in memory.”
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate precipitation prevention, a technology for which Nissan predicts the use of serial vehicles in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Enjoy the fear before you take a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, besides having enough capital to provide injections, does not lack ingenuity.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages from banks with dubious solvency, it has created a popular online science game "Bad Credit Hotel".
It wasn't a bad credit hotel... or a messy hotel.
The hotel and especially its reception look gloomy, so that one can think once, twice and three times about whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not too detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the whole public.
What happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel there is a dream room.
At least something, because it's better not to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its MUFG capital
The Morgan Stanley bank said it was centered on Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, which is issuing $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital. The adoption of the report was accompanied by a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after unveiling their preliminary deal, both banks explained that MUFG plans to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s common shares at a unit price of $25.25, representing a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion to acquire convertible securities, which will secure a 10% return and whose exchange rate is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley clarified that the entire operation will be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% below its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley’s shares, however, lost 6.79 percent and reached $23.07 at around 5:00 p.m. Greenwich time.
“This strategic merger presents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a banking holding company,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to allow him to diversify his activities, but at the same time puts him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest ace to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms introduced on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been amended over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“Just a week ago, we thought,” said Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG in Tokyo, “that our participation would consist exclusively of regular events.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and also cover up."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley securities 7% less than their book value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings from the stock by about 20%.
The agreement envisages that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are exchanged for a period of time at a price of 50% above the exchange price, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the spokespersons refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One eligibility ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "sensitively" cut his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the cost of insurance against the debt-related non-payment risk has risen sharply.
On Monday, the costs were reversed, but remained high at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's redemption, announced that it had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establish a republic around socialism in the 21st century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Last Sunday, the third nominee submitted to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a draft of the new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, as 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the referendum "yes".
According to these results, 28% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order for the bill to be adopted, he had to get half the vote plus one.
Two polls conducted in the east of the polling room and a calculation by NGOs predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, situating them in the range of 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
"The constitution has won on the whole line," he assured and congratulated Ecuadorians at Guayaquil Governorate headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received greetings from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, took place quietly, concerned the text on 444 points building “new socialism” promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy by reserving to it the “development planning” of a country that lives primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the currencies sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, protected by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to exercise two consecutive four-year mandates and be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will exercise this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the constitution upholds the principle of free health and education, which the president began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, terminating the agreement between Washington and Quito to use the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 hostages freed in Chad
The Egyptian commando attacked the kidnapper of eleven tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were transported alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, an Egyptian commando was liberated in Chad.
The hostages flew around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special jet to al-Maza military base, close to the Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported, without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press, aboard a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, the outskirts of Cairo’s residential district, to undergo medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers," Egypt's tourism minister Zohejr Garrana said on the airport's runway.
Since its capture on September 19, during a safari in a four-wheel drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border director of the Aegyptous agency, organizers of safaris.
A senior Egyptian security official suggested that 30 members of special forces who approached the site on board two helicopters set off on a leak during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shooting, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," the source, who wished to remain anonymous, said.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the “lightning” unit were sent to Sudan, where they gained the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, mentioned the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces from Belgrade, where he is currently based.
"We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people from our secret services, from the special forces," he said.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
On the eve of the attack, the Sudanese army said it had detained a four-wheel-drive vehicle on board the hijackers, killing six of them, including a Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed they were affiliated with a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - Quiet majority of cultural resorts
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of newspapers with thumbnails and is the topic of the current election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still overlooked.
Who will stand up to plunder the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national monuments that starve to death?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that it will forget its monuments and its historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don’t have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the Constitution of our American neighbors that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives, and all county organizations, in partnership.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Companies for the History of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers from 211 societies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy are working to uncover history, preserve a pile of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few small amounts.
Often, these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, who are desperately protesting when promoters and leaders drop their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally meet the Tribune for history and monuments?
The Government of the Benelux State Bank of Fortis
The Benelux states will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the spreading effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalisation: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which has a share of the euro, a share of the capital of 11 billion also in Madrid.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis Bank is the first in the euro area to enter a major crisis in the context of the crisis of international financial markets, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made in this regard could in some respects be seen as precedents.
According to the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will redeem nearly half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets there.
The bank will sell part of its capital shares with absolute certainty, especially the activities purchased last year from Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The shares of Fortis Bank began to fall sharply last week, in the second half of the week there were already serious signs of the crisis in the constitution.
But analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to be bankrupt.
The company’s securities fell by 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the total market capitalisation of the group is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, but according to the company’s executives, this is unrealistic.
The company’s management blames the fall in Fortis’ shares for the uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of a $700 billion US package plan.
Stocks rose slightly on Monday.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to head the bank.
The monetary institute was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has yet signed up.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
There has not been a panic among the bank’s clients and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis Bank has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America often deny the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with an applicant based on people’s data on the purchase of medicines.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the henhouse to the fox," Richard Dick, the author of the program for monitoring prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make insurance and the amounts paid in the event of insurance events depend on the health status of the applicants, and if the risk is assessed as too high, they do not even close insurance with it.
They had previously sent the persons concerned for medical examinations and only concluded the contract when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on an identification number from pharmacies, a customer can easily find out what medications the person has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself deduces what type of disease he suffers from and what his health condition is.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to the fact that you have virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts you in the category of at-risk.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some also determine the risk factor at the same time, so that the insurance company has almost no work left besides paperwork, although minor problems arise.
The disadvantages include that leckter drugs can also be used for several purposes, some compounds are useful, for example, against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant risk-increasing factor from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, whereas the first mentioned difficulties do not.
In order to request and process data, special companies have been created, which, before providing the necessary information from pharmacies, ask the patient for permission.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so, although they have not been punished for their past negligence.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory tests, which are linked to data on the medicines they are taking, which allows them to provide an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, at the same time it will be increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give authorities the power to control even companies specializing in providing data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, he developed his program in such a way that the transfer of data is subject to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that he can barely refuse the permission in question, otherwise insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the chickens are just a little tied to the boa will line.
The Global Marseille Menu
EU and India to double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this theme led the agenda of the ninth summit, among other, mostly global issues.
Today there will also be a Franco-Indian summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power, which should be given greater opportunity to speak on international issues, but Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in support of the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This issue was thus not further discussed at yesterday's, already ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, respectively, and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that the turnover of trade in five years will double, or increase to more than one billion euros.
Since the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Twenty-six existing bilateral agreements on civil aviation with India have been legally reconciled, giving the green light to future air transport.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy said the talks would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi ranks among the EU’s partners up to ninth.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, respectively, both sides condemned it in all its forms and called for an accelerated convening of the UN conference.
They also urged the conclusion of the Doha round of trade talks, although both have a large share in its previous failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate agenda, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least twenty percent by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as well as to the need to conclude a global agreement at next year’s climate conference and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent rising food prices and support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is on a visit to the French capital today, where he is about to conclude a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that commissions for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros will be received by French companies.
According to agency reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries to take over the 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press meeting at the Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present the numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is still decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
The plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane, Steve Fossett, a millionaire, was found missing on September 3, 2007, while flying across the desert in Nevada.
The debris was discovered on a 3,000-metre-high plateau in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains on the plane.
Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, dissected the doubts that remained: “The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we are sure it is exactly what Steve Fossett flew in on the day he disappeared,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) announced that hours after the debris was detected, an investigation team was dispatched, which eventually identified the plane: this is exactly a Bellanc 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has won a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, he flew around the world in an airplane and without landing.
His many records also include a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, above the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, an advertisement you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirlwind of novelties into this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional processing that the communication that accompanies the launch of the Suv Glk will be unexpected and unconventional and will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will launch an unofficial way of communication also thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is thus first used in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan’s main business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the use of special glasses that will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will leave the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology Eluma8, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its trifles, to then fold again into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new with this advertisement into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are those 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years and which, to be honest, has never done exaggerated problems before.
She has never met an opponent's fans.
The group's orientation is right-handed.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-coloured flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they were removed so that they would not be recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a true Nazi fan, Levsky.
Figc has made available to Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all by name, that is, easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the running Dasl, no one who was forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans, who had earlier offenses from the stadium, were denied a ticket and banned from the game.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that come from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to put Daspo for five years at least to the fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, don't even step into a stadium anymore.
Fortunately.
However, there is now a fear of emulation: this means that more than one hundred and fifty will be added.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not justify those who behave in this way," Viminale said.
So, "right open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Lecce."
In Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can count on even one part of the Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"Church Leader-Leader and tightened arms during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime...".
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really unhappy way) who is the director of the Viminal Observatory for a few weeks (acquired a place that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a quaestor in Trieste, where the nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate a leader, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the Observatory No. 1, “crimes are attributed to the country in which they occurred.
So far, this group has remained within bounds, now let's take a good look at what happened and evaluate it for the future.
But let’s also talk about whistling at the Mameli hymn: it’s not a crime either, but if you’ll excuse me, it’s ineducation.”
