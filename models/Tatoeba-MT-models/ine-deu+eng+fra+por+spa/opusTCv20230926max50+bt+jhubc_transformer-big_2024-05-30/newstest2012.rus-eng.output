Parliament does not support an amendment that gives freedom to Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected the attempt to cancel the article according to which the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would have led to the release of the former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the bill on mitigating sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was deemed unfavourable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko argues that the verdict is political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process is also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify it.
Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or insurrection, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert. Without him, the war is over.
It is time to determine the winners.
As a rule, the country is won by Islamists; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the usual Sharia law, which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the punishment for theft is the cutting off of a hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society made up of rival clans will be united by the Qur’an.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind nor the best and most likely would not be suitable, for example, for the people of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from unbelievers.
Their only justification is that, in their opinion, the NATO raids were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each blow.
And if we are looking for winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of profit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of the "crusaders".
Although without occupation, will the oil companies receive Libya’s black gold practically at no cost?
They probably won't, and then the West will finally be able to lean on selfless civil rights protection.
Unless the followers of Shariah put an end to this.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors.
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries released GDP data in the 3rd quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy has stagnated, with Germany and France showing growth.
The debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are already looking not only towards Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
Eurozone statistical offices in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by the expected 0.5%; France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (0.3% growth over the initial 0.1%). France reported a slight decrease, 0.1% (original information suggested stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation. According to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
The Key Events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed growth of 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with the forecasts of analysts.
Greece’s economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield of its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yield of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the deteriorating situation in the region, the yield of Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech national team has been selected for the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won with a score of 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team successfully coped with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goal of Petra Yirachek, they won with a score of 1: 0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky to retain a significant advantage after the home rematch, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the progress of the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and good luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yira<0xC4><0x8D>ek; won 1–0 in Montenegro and celebrates the start of the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovi<0xC4><0x87> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x87> became the most unsuccessful pair of the match after missing two great opportunities.
Gorgeous Petr Czech - one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. And the Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute the game was very intense.
Both teams had difficulty making combinations; the game was mostly in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the host team in the first half. Long-range strikes on the line of defense were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a living shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday at noon, the prayers of the students before the entrance to the building were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a live shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
In this way, they demonstrated a willingness to defend their country’s nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that everything indicates that Iran has not abandoned its attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday at noon, the prayers of students before the entrance to the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximum paralysis of Iran’s nuclear program, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Eating children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and sausages for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families who lead an unhealthy lifestyle.
We again see the importance of the environment and behavior patterns that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausages appear on the tables of children suffering from obesity, almost twice as often as in families with children who have a normal weight.
More than 19% of obese children ate fries at dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports. This, however, applies to most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said that their parents find time for sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year, with almost 900 elementary school students from all over Bohemia participating.
The Obesity event was not an accident for the second year in a row, with the support of insurance company V<0xC5><0xA1>eobecná zdravni poji<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA5>ovna and company Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils in grades 4-8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate sports activity are the main determinants that cause the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either excess weight or obesity.
"For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five times a day, on a breakfast-breakfast-lunch-breakfast-dinner schedule, which is one of the essential conditions for proper nutrition," the study concluded.
No lunch and sausages in the evening.
Experts warn that even such relative details as a regular family breakfast time are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school families eat breakfast together.
In most families, breakfast is served separately.
The worst discovery is that in every tenth family, people do not eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The study found that fried foods are more commonly consumed in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet soft drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly exercise, this figure has more than doubled - up to 15% - when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to prepare their own menu based on the proposed products and based on their tastes and preferences.
“Food preferences in Czech children aged 12-15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating.”
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
“Special anxiety is caused by the great popularity of sweet soft drinks,” the study concludes.
As the main dish, the pasta defeated the bird with a small upper hand.
However, the children showed virtually no interest in beans, fish and vegetable dishes.
Striving for a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also found that children are willing to change their eating habits provided they are provided with relevant information.
“Many of the study’s control group demonstrated a significant shift in preferences toward healthy eating when they filled out a questionnaire after completing the Obesity lecture – it’s not a coincidence,” the study said.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet soft drinks - more children began to prefer them just water.
In addition, as a main dish, children were more likely to celebrate birds and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and pastries.
The stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article about training for stylists, I sat down on the volume of information in introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in the field; advice on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all this works in real life.
Next, more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (there is no man on the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boyish figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than the norm.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce wide shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add missing volumes.
We were given tips on how to emphasize the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, i.e. possessing more lavish breasts and hips and a narrow waist, while not dressing them too provocatively.
For example, if the difference in the volume of the waist and hips is so large that you can not pick up a skirt or trousers, it is worth having at least one thing sewn to order.
You will obviously not regret the funds invested, because perfectly seated clothing is priceless.
In a skirt, made to order, you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves, rolls, uncovers the waist, etc.
Owners of boys' figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with folds, an application, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I am glad that I have a whole week to realize all this.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much given the homework we've got.
Each participant of the course had to come up with two outfits for any celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I'm going to dress Miranda Kerr, which you may know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I’m happy about myself because it’s much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguilera, who has recently improved a ton (please keep in mind that I’m exaggerating), or very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them using graphic programs.
The mudboard – so called the result of work – then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphical component of the style.
The stylist not only dresses real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But that was only on Sunday.
Stylists need general knowledge
The Saturday lecture, saturated with information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in this field.
Stylist, Honza Suburna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Ranch.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn in the usual way, above jeans and t-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without fastenings, like a dress.
Another option is to roll up the sleeves or raise the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
“Play with him,” he said.
Anyway, I appreciated the following advice the most: “For your work, you should know the rules perfectly.”
Then you can start breaking them," Jacob told us.
Here I finally understood why we’re going to look at all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see something completely different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that a stylist should have more outfit options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a ten-page fashion review (equivalent to ten outfits) I should be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture the item of clothing often looks and works in combination with others quite differently than in reality.
We need to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorna confirmed that often the image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have an amazing vocals, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
The attitude to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often consider it superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something, and how they look - secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different (less) size than the one they really wear.
Then we turn to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote anything about some celebrity being fattened/lost, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for a stylist to understand fashion and be able to choose an outfit.
Our work mainly consists of communicating with the people we dress for; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to appreciate people, not to imitate them and stick to their opinion.
“If a manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can’t throw out her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible.”
“Find at least a few things that you can commend and advise what you can wear with them,” says Mario.
He also showed us what specifically a work bag should fit.
This is a bag that you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, adhesive roller or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylers use it when shooting some items, such as bags or hats), special clips for fastening the fabric on the back in case they are too big, the clothes are too big, and
In order to distract from lectures and gain some practical experience, we learned to make the right linings on the soles of the shoes.
Even during shooting in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged – not to mention shooting outdoors.
And here we are with the glue.
You should not touch the shoes with scissors so as not to spoil them.
It requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
These skills did not appeal to me.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend.
I’m beginning to realize that being a professional stylist isn’t as easy as you might say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Oversight
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work due to a series of completely inappropriate and negligent mistakes.
The ambitions were met to some extent, but that doesn’t matter, because no one clearly wanted to do extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subheading "Escape" was associated with great hopes.
It was expected to shift previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demo versions indicated that the game would take a decent place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, the end result is much different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is spoiled by a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, in reality, this is not a mistake, but a manifestation of the inexplicable laziness of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You become part of the story, the protagonist of which, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race across America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has a few interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes place on its own route, individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
Therefore, there is no sense that the same thing happens all the time in the game.
Despite the fact that the schedule is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are nice to watch.
However, the game does not evoke strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race from time to time brings to life an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you get into a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to get under an avalanche.
The races are quite well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that’s enough.
For a while you are trying to outrun several rivals (essentially a regular race); then you are trying to improve time (a standard race with a timer); or you are competing with one opponent.
In addition, from time to time you run into the police, which complicates your task even more.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out that it’s good for the game because this property doesn’t bother; considering all of the above, it’s one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a drawback.
If you are looking for an imitation of real life, you will have to look elsewhere.
And yet this model of driving is very suitable for dynamic races, although you can find better options on the market.
So far, it's very good.
However, after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don’t expect complex changes and collisions from such a game, but if you don’t have any idea before you collide with an object, how your machine will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, bypassing or passing by cars in a dense flow, you sometimes slightly touch another machine. And yet sometimes in a practically similar situation, your machine starts to spin insanely.
Or it's just broken.
It’s not that important thanks to the restart system, but it’s enough to spoil the fun.
The restarts are arranged in such a way that if you crash or go far away from the track, the game returns you to the point where it stopped.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the beginning.
This is useful in case something doesn’t work out, but you can’t fully rely on it.
Sometimes reboots are not enough, and you have to learn a separate section of the race by heart.
An important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be passed in a certain way, otherwise you just won’t fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain place in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see your opponent easily passing between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you are there, the cars are already positioned so that you need to either bypass them or set the speed.
It doesn’t matter when you’re around them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Rivals have other advantages.
During the game you discover several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent overtakes you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand in front of you no matter what.
The fact is that when he drives in front of you, it worsens your overview, which leads to one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it quickly begins to cause irritation.
It’s a pity because despite the simple driving model, the game is entertaining and sometimes so eventful that you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on around you.
It doesn’t matter what you don’t miss – a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to track the fillings along the way, because it is on them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super-sportsmen for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; these are races on individual sections that you will learn in the course of the game.
Here you win both medals and points for your personal business, common to the challenges and story modes.
Many possibilities are available to achieve a higher level of driving: starting from cars and ending with profile data.
In addition, the profile is associated with the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares the results you achieved with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here’s another drawback that’s hard to understand; this is an example from the last race in a sequence.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (we’ll assume that’s the case), where you run on rails in the dark (we’ll assume that’s the case).
Your speedometer shows figures from 150 to 200 km/h (we’ll assume that’s the case) when suddenly a subway train hits you in the back, turning your car into a heap of scrap.
For a few days, our editors have been discussing whether, at the time of making the game, no one really thought for a second, or if its creators really think of us as such idiots.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although it’s a pity that at some critical moments, the quality of the recording, sometimes quite severely, decreases.
This is especially true for incidents with a large number of participants, where a good record wouldn’t help you either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
In order to please the broadest possible youth audience, the soundtrack has 'compositions of different styles'; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
Need for Speed: Escape is a bit of a mess.
If the game had avoided clearly unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Of course, it’s a good entertainment, but be prepared for the fact that the shortcomings will blind you like an airport spotlight.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for being unfriendly and skeptical of the euro.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has caused considerable disagreements between individual organizations."
“I didn’t expect such a terrible war.”
"It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down and all players will get used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She proved how much she adheres to her motto "Clear and Open about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so simply and clearly that many lecturers from the CU Law School would be envious.
Moreover, Vicenova commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, critics said he was an ordinary gray office mouse who can't play any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role."
“He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven member countries at the same time, who is great at communicating with them and who has a clear idea of which side the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?"; i.e. as an important step towards the unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vitsenova continued to focus on a program that is key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a successful one last year.
The Czechs were dealing with the impending financial crisis; they overcame this crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership summit.
She said the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Czech representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis caused the ongoing fermentation.
In addition, it is necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which will receive less; all these issues are in the forthcoming agenda.
The ambassador recalled the key slogans she brought to Brussels: “About Europe, in a language that can be understood”.
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties?
It is also going to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organisations.
A multi-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador argues that the Czechs are considered to be Eurosceptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than positive sides of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that this is due to several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful presidency of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, on what occasion is the Visegrad Group again?' and he's not even happy with that.
In the future, the Union of Vitsenov expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not multiple-speed Europe more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that countries that want must unite, while those that don’t can stay aside.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will really be a two-speed Europe,” Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in advancing the rule that all issues pertaining to the whole EU should be discussed by all the participating countries, not just those belonging to the eurozone.
Brand's History:
The IBM innovator enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is likely to be “long-lasting.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The longevity of the company was established by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson, Senior.
He believed in his motto that many world problems can be easily solved if people want to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a constant move to the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first 100 years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the next 100 years, we hope to achieve even more,” said Samuel J. Palmizano, current CEO of the company.
Complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached employee care in the same way as Batia in the Czech Republic – IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniform and a sophisticated bonus system for the best.
The same is true of IBM’s long-term relationship with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company found a brilliant application to talented people. It was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
It is in line with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has been organizing meetings, online brainstorming, during which many future innovations emerge.
Not surprisingly, there are about half a million people working in the company.
An organization with a good reputation
The company’s strong position in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the outset, from a conceptual point of view, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company," Harvard Business School professor and author of the book on IBM Rosabet Moss Canter told the Economist.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Joey Colony of Forrester Research.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
Over the course of a century, IBM, or the “Blue Giant,” as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that it is the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the largest number of patents among all U.S. technology companies, with five of its employees receiving the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode and a floppy disk.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (the first is Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look ahead.
Not all of its products were to the taste of buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; online service Prodigy and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is determined by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM easily lays the foundation on multiple platforms – if they don’t work, it refuses them.
This is different, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing crashes on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM’s main revenue comes from services, with about one-fifth in each case coming from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, with capital twice as small, it was the strongest equipment manufacturer.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion in low-profit assets, while investing $58 billion in promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the amount of investment during the years of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM has not done any harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM’s stock price has risen by a record 120 percent; the company’s net income has steadily increased.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM's Story: From a Cheese Knife to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name "Computing, Tabulation, Recording Corporation" was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924. Originally, this was the name of the brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of IBM's future were laid by the merger of four companies, whose history begins in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies such as the legendary "table clock", i.e. clocks that record the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Runlet Flint, who also chaired the board of trustees of the company until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the director of the company, to help him run the company.
Then the CEO pushed the founder of IBM into the shadows – Watson’s ideas remain the basis of an unwavering corporate culture and individuality.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and sale of various business equipment – from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenue doubled to $9 million, and the company's massive expansion into all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his place in the chair was taken by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both employees and IBM computers helped NASA control spaceflight — to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 — man’s flight to the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM Line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined computer standards at the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer production to Chinese company Lenovo, simultaneously acquiring consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus focusing entirely on high-value consulting and services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is to use technology wisely in areas where it has not yet been planned, and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the field of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM’s traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-class research group on speech recognition also operates.
Regarding her unfaithful husband:
Yvette, keep your asshole, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richterzova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Richter (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Yvette Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa may return home, but not as my partner anymore," Richterzhova explained.
When Darina Richterzhova gave Bartoshova shelter in her house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Yvette to leave R<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>an after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After some time, Darina surrendered, pretending to be content with her husband’s romance; and now she finally said goodbye to him.
He doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richter and Bartoshova ever break up, his wife will not accept him with her arms outstretched.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him out.”
"However, he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a man with whom I am connected," Richterzhova said, adding that she has already freed herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change that."
“My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
“Our union is still functioning; I am responsible for repairs, garden, home and shopping.”
“Darina and I communicate perfectly well, but we don’t share the bed anymore,” Richter told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richterov finds a new love, he will not interfere with it.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes, with whom and if she has a buddy.
"I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I'm fully responsible," he said.
Women’s Worst Habits: Are They Affecting You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines describing several female habits that make men angry?
Shopping (disambiguation)
Is your second half complaining that you are constantly shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one item each week?
Do you like to shop on big sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who of you will refuse to go shopping for clothes in search of the perfect fitting clothes and try it (preferably in different color options) in samples?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait for you outside...
Eternal Discontent
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilograms - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
- Yeah.
Then you are part of a group of women who are confused in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop looking after yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to the constant complaints of their partners about their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more often such complaints occur, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness.
It's like an endless story.
Washing glasses, cleaning with a vacuum cleaner, washing the floor, wiping the dust, cleaning the bathroom - at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for stepping on a clean tile in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window in the living room that was so difficult to clean?
In case you suffer from this “deviation,” try to realize that falling into extremes is not good; and that in your family order and cleanliness should not come first.
A harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationship, as well as the whole family.
The desire to command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"You're going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels for dishes should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very tedious.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood this, women wouldn't have to command them so often.
Speltny
Some women like to gossip, insult and weave intrigues against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how, and why.
From time to time, I guess we all gossip.
Let’s be honest, this is the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossip, women who often gossip and despise others. They, especially in the women's workforce, pose a great danger to their environment.
The resultant transfers of Yagra and Voracek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful transfers of hockey forward Yaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the ice of Carolina. He again became the most successful Czech player of the match.
In both cases, Claude Giraud used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another show and was declared the best player of the match.
Two successful transfers of the match also belonged to the player in the same team with Jagr Jakub Voracek.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Jura.
"I told him before the game that he would score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like that," Jagr explained, after whose actions Giroud scored a goal at the first opportunity Flyers gave.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Czech footprint".
The locker Harriets Voracek took the washer and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with a numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half, Flyers again led.
Particularly Giraud.
After Jagra's successful pass, he scored a third goal; his shot was subsequently converted to a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like to play with him.”
“I don’t mean to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely in the top three,” Jagr said, praising his midfielder.
“I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.
“It makes me happy.”
“I want to support him.”
"All these years in the NHL my teammates have tried to help me, and now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's penalty, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger did a great job in our area."
"He hit the washbasin, I accelerated, and Reed crossed to the far edge."
"I aimed at him and I'm glad it worked," Voracek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the team of Montreal Czech Yaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an injury to the upper body.
Together with an experienced defender, the Canadians lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomas Plekanets was unable to score during one of their attacks.
More than losing points, the home coach was saddened by a large number of injuries in the back row as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
“We can’t do anything about it anyway, we just have to accept it,” said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement for replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the washbasin out of our zone."
"What was our weakness," added defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Onjay Pavelets helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted the five-match series of defeats, were scored by five different players.
Dynamics of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed to work in the former Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was strictly restricted, travel agencies of the time mainly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, on holiday Czech tourists went to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which resulted in significant restrictions on travel by Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was required; otherwise, an individual trip was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but it was either necessary to stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or to have "good friends" in the agency.
And that's not all.
Currency authorization was required for travel to the West and was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without currency authorization it was impossible to obtain money (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most often the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the appearance of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit persists to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus survived a real revolution.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are no longer aware of is that until 1989 we were not able to freely visit the most popular Croatia nowadays, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the visa requirement for neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, triggering a huge wave of short trips, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of traveling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at the time lacked a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring their own food (canned food, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown. After decades, our tourists can finally freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income increased, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared with the past, air travel has now become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to book wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit virtually all developed countries of the world except the United States. This made our travels even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000. Large demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have brought Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter flights from the Czech Republic will depart to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. repealed the requirement to obtain a visa for Czech tourists. Our country thus forever joined the most developed countries of the world.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 SEK per person during their holiday abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
General Assembly must elect president, Pat's threat returns
For about five months, Czech football has not had a president. There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Gasek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nijmegen on Tuesday.
There is still no consensus as to what election rules to follow.
Without this, the vote for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindrij Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Paclik are eager to lead Czech football.
Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek left his post in June. As he left, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
However, the Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek era once again plunged football into a dispute between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite obvious on September 16, when it was necessary to elect a new president.
The delegates of the general meeting came to the National House in Prague, Smichov, in vain, as the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement as to who was entitled to vote at the general meeting - only the legal representatives or also the officials to whom the authority had been granted.
This point has since been partly resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that representation based on the powers conferred is not possible.
Disputes over the rules of the election, however, continue.
The Executive Board was also not very helpful, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinarily, it was mainly concerned with this issue.
The views on voting methods have changed several times, but the key question remains the same.
The question is: how to move to the 3rd round and avoid the pat?
“The dispute is whether to follow the established norms or find another model,” says Dusan Svoboda, one of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R’s vice presidents, who represents professional football in the association’s management.
Based on the model provided for by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received a lot of support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise - to consider the winner of the election the candidate with the most of the total number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that the overall percentage of the winner must win at least two-thirds of the votes.
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; this would completely reject the concept of the two chambers," Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing norms.
Surprisingly, Tomasz Paclick agrees with his opinion, although according to estimates, the rules of the election, determined by the charter, please Pelta more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to be held as much as possible according to the charter."
“I want to avoid all sorts of representative nonsense, as at the previous general meeting,” says owner Victoria Plzen, who is the first candidate; and in his statements he largely contradicted Pelte.
Pelta is optimistic.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nimburg; he also hopes that candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional fermentation will be calmed after today's expected exit of the national team in the European Championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate", says the representative of Jablonec. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management both at the professional and regional levels.
The Reich is more restrained.
"I'm hoping for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous."
"It's not between Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could cause another disruption to the general assembly."
"I hope common sense wins," Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was supposed to deliver, among others, the vice presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, did not depart from Prague in the morning due to a technical failure. They were looking for an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the venue of the replay match.
Eventually, the ministerial meeting expected on Wednesday could become crucial.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, Josef Dobesh, would like the opposing parties in the country’s strongest sports association to reach an agreement.
A lot is at stake: government subsidies; football credit; and the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV with the new Czech sports directorate after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik enters the presidential race because he does not see a suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of the footballers Plzen Tomasz Paclik saw a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even claim a high position.
“If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself.”
"But such a man has not yet been found," Paclick told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Paclik’s motive for joining the fight against Miroslav Pelta and Jindrikh Reichl is to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favourite of the elections, from entering the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R administration.
Moreover, Paclick emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when the next general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this position to be taken by an experienced top manager not too closely related to football life.
"I've talked to a few people that I could have thought of."
"It was awful for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football.
"I would like to change that opinion," he said.
Currently, Paclik’s main disagreement with Pelta is related to the latter’s relationship with Roman Berbro, president of the regional football association in Plzen. Berbro is a man of a controversial reputation, who behind the scenes is known as an influential lobbyist who is able to influence the voices of the public.
Paclik, therefore, considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging to football," Paclik said.
He hints at the fact that a few years ago, Pelta’s name was recorded during a phone audition in a corruption case; Pelta managed to avoid conviction.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring to football.
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclick. He now does not mention his previous statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta becomes president".
If Paczlik wins on Thursday, he could introduce cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclik supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can represent him as the head of the team."
"But he can't run the association."
"I also don't have a nose in what I don't understand," said Paclik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judiciary brigade headed by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclick says he's risking running the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer he has managed the Pilsen team, which with his help celebrated his first league triumph in May.
“I have the power to make the football environment change, to support it for the better.”
"Limit the influence of certain groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals council, which leads to disgusting situations," said Paczlik. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta, Daniel Krzetinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen relations between FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it will lobby at the highest political level for more sports money from lottery fees.
“This is one of the key points that the new president must address.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go,” he said.
Paclik does not consider his relationship with the Pilsen club a burden, although he claims that the president of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be independent.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, and Reichl with Prague Dukla.
"It's not the perfect option."
“And yet I don’t see any point in the hypocritical transfer of my Pilsen shares to someone else, since I’m going to go back there in six months,” Paclik says.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R rules that will avoid Election Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he will fight for the new rules of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R to avoid disputes about the rules of election in the future.
Until the talks in Nijmegen on Thursday, the Jablonec official remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the election match will significantly distract today’s expected success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he wins, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the election at the last minute before the last general meeting. A two-month delay could thus have been useful to him in defending his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel it’s time for someone to lead the association,” says a man primarily associated with the Jablonec club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the association’s executive committee.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If different methods of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September," Pelta said.
He referred to the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a false goal for delegates.
“If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take on personal responsibility if this attempt proves unsuccessful.”
“This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist,” Pelta said.
In addition, he says that he is not trying to stand out against the background of rivals.
In the past, he has already stated that he can present his cooperation with Jindrich Reichl, whom he values for his legal education; he is fully aware of the fact that his rival candidate should be his first vice president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Paclik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
“He’s been in football for over a year and he’s had some success.
“In any case, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by the methods of his campaign.”
"And that's why some of them are now questioning his true identity," Pelta said of his competitor. Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon the knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent the entire football team.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the consequences of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Immediately after that, I would focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of head of football would not involve dismissals of staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual employees." This was his message to Insurance, where a prolonged period of inter-government causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believes that delegates will come to Nimburk on Thursday not in vain.
"If the only question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can deal with that."
“Football needs the confidence it can gain only by finally choosing its leader,” says Pelta, who remains an optimist two days before the key day of his career.
Reichl promises that under his leadership FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will begin to work actively
If the current vice-president, Yindrich Reichl, becomes president of the Czech Football Association at the meeting on Thursday, many people in the Association will be dissatisfied, according to rumors.
Reichl promises that if elected, the time of hard work will come.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual areas of football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; raise more money for football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gashek.
“As president, I would like to focus on football in general.”
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national team, professional football and youth football events.”
"I don't mean to say that I will do everything myself," Reichl told <0xC4><0x8C>TK in an interview.
“I’m a team player and I want to allocate powers on the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area.”
"I will carefully distribute the tasks so that in each of these segments football has made great strides forward."
“It’s probably not going to appeal to a lot of people because it’s going to be hard work, not just criticism of the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly made him doubt his candidacy.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if there is any sense in this; and that I will not be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every step," he explained his doubts.
"However, a lot of people told me I shouldn't give up, otherwise others would come."
“It’s a trust that I can’t throw away,” he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“A lot of work has been done over those two years, and I don’t want to erase it all.”
"Processes have been started that can bring results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association could return to what it was before Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“I believe in a systematic approach, and that’s something that Mirek Pelta is unlikely to be competent about.”
"It is surrounded by people who would engage in football so that it is accessible only to the chosen ones."
“I can be accused of many things, but certainly not of subjectivity.”
“I’m trying to be objective.”
"I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the elected minority," Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies the accusations that he will only be the President of the Czech Republic.
“Although many people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do the maximum for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue the fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While Plzen manager Tomasz Paczlik joined the presidential campaign, Reichl did not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes," Reichl said. To his success, he credits the savings of tens of millions of kroner on unfavourable contracts and negotiations.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that there is no unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was “expelled from the process of returning credit to Czech football,” he considers another rival, Paclik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job at Plzen this year."
“If elected, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant staff changes in the committees.”
“He wouldn’t distort the facts for his own benefit,” Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the water
Yulia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can experience the incredible waters of Europe - and relax the tired body in the jacuzzi after a city tour or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing Iris Meder could not do during her research trips for the last year and a half: without her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubim waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored art-nouvo swimming pools.
She hurried to add every favorite pool to her notebook – with important details about the building’s construction and history.
The architecture historian Meder has surveyed more than 200 swimming pools – and has now gathered impressions in his recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing), where everything went from the public swimming pools in Munich to the historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest and the "Bad funk" in the Black Forest.
Her "trip to the most unusual bathing sites in Central Europe" led her through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited bathing sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sport, says Meder, but in the water everything is different.
The only drawback is that swimmers should tolerate the blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the tempting smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful howling of birds in the park.
“I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible,” says Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Splashing in the pool and exquisite oils in the sauna are such a significant health factor in baths, because, according to Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have a surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and trampolines.
The illustrated 190-page edition of "Swimming Joys" contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases - and makes you want to jump into the water.
Meder’s reservoir collector discovered several outstanding specimens during research in Hungary.
She discovered a nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (Miskolts-Tapolca Cave Bath) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the form of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasper), as well as the splendid cuplets of the Therapeutic Center.
From the many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, a stunning view opens up. You can see the whole of Zurich from the rooftop bath or view the snowy Arlberg from the outdoor pool in St. Anthony. And there is a window overlooking the steam room that allows you to see
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld. The Aqua Cathedral in Ectal looks like a UFO, just landed in the Alps.
In winter, a pair of three open shells rises from it, which seem quite small against the background of the Ectal Mountains.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
The collector of pools Meder did not meet the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell gray. Arpad baths in Bekeshchab smell so much of oil that it may be difficult for you to believe that you are in a healing source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in alkaline water. Water is almost black from the sludge that sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool - a healing experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the open pool of Czech Baths in Luga<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she discovered that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms, designed by architect Dusan Jurkovich in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the viewable windows of an art-nouveau red and white and yellow building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on the hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in the Black Forest is the Thermal Water Palace in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction. You will discover not only neo-Romanesque elements of the period after construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, added around 1900.
After a thorough renovation in 1995, Thermal Palace – the favorite swimming pool of pool knower Iris Meder – and not only because it comes from the Black Forest.
“It’s a real achievement — so skillfully combining such different architectural styles,” Meder says.
Dive into the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary occupation.
Speculation of Agricultural Products <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Deutsche Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Teves
Will the Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann has given the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of respondents are demanding that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report’s author, Harald Schumann, demonstrates that betting on world commodity exchanges is raising prices – and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is directed directly against the head of the Deutsche Bank, Joseph Ackermann, although major banking firms such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley do the same.
Initially, betting on goods was conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand – and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism, promising to investigate the allegations and stating that no trade “is worth putting at risk the Deutsche Bank’s good reputation.”
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may be reduced or completely discontinued.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode welcomed the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "Betting on rising food prices is a striking example of how thoughtlessly banks are now acting against common interests."
As the chief lobbyist of the bank, Ackermann has a certain duty, according to Bode.
"The Deutsche Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that make money rates on food prices," Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s the starving people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s quick reaction is surprising at first, but in the meantime, the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before the end of his time in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not be transferred to the supervisory board as planned.
The abolition of the controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also has virtually no need to worry about expenses - the consequences will have to deal with his successor.
One in two would refuse to invest in commodities.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people participated.
No more than eleven percent believe that investments that bet on the price of food are acceptable to the Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take specific steps if they found their bank involved in such a trade. According to the study, every second would withdraw deposits, which ultimately lead to commodity speculation.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would think about closing the account and switching to another bank.
Category: 21st-century houses in Vienna
The pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg Vinsovski
Architectural history with ups, downs and a happy ending. Austria’s pavilion for the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, emptied and was abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition centre.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, bold that expressed faith in technical progress.
Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its lightweight floating steel and glass construction.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
Eventually, he became world-famous in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and its sister, a cup-shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna South Station, transformed and opened as a 20th-century museum in 1962 – and is often referred to as the “House of the 20th Century” for this reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not have walls on which to hang works of art, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been vacant since 2001, and its condition is getting worse and worse.
The architect Adolf Krishnitz has restored the pavilion, which was called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum – the Belvedere Museum’s office, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening – is in every sense a joyous event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, contributed to the new venture.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figure skater in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, will adopt the decision to persuade politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds,
The new museum was to accommodate a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with modern art. An office building was also to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
Krishanitz was then the perfect candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for restoring and expanding the Vienna Secession of Josef Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied at Schwanzer's University of Technology in Vienna, and the pavilion was for him "an extremely important place" where he attended exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood before the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose during the last restructuring were much more serious. The building was an "energy sinker," Krishanitz says.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, reinforced fiberglass safe glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safe glass.
The steel translucents of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created a space for the new use of the building, an inflated light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a virtually new building, but still the elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in an old red-brown color to protect against corrosion.
The theater hall is the same as it used to be.
All this under the strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would have been approved by the museum management,” Krishanitz says, pointing to uneven flooring in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light, despite limitations, problems and transformations.
Krishanitz recently noted that the pavilion "from Brussels" was rough - a typical story of "drop in the city".
Such an architecture "is not always in place" and nevertheless wants to "stimulate real awareness".
The house of the 21st century is in the right place, because when planning the city happened unexpected luck. A completely redesigned "main station district" with offices and residential real estate is growing around the Swiss Garden.
There may be a second happy event. The house of the 21st century can be supplemented by the second building of Kri<0xC5><0xA1>anitsa - the collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired the Temporary Exhibition Hall of Berlin and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location in neighboring Sweden.
Deutsche Bahn plans multimillion-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has released an anti-crisis plan to avoid cancelling trains in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn’s internal anti-crisis plan, Bild newspaper reports that investments totalling around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million are planned by 2015.
The investments are designed to improve the efficiency of locomotives and the railway network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaged employees involved in snow-cleaning from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clean the platforms of snow and ice before the start of work and 90 percent of the necessary shots within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned about the possibility of train cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with heads of government and industry two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Service for years.
There have also been some delays in the supply of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the axes of ICE trains much more often over the years after one of the ICE trains broke an axle at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank to Pay Millions of Pounds in U.S. Fines
New troubles came after riots around Joseph Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is threatened with a multimillion-pound fine in the US.
Like Deutsche Bank, there were few problems at home, the past of the U.S. industrial giant has now pushed it. Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to calm the controversy that arose after the bankruptcy of the financial crisis of the five major banks.
The problem has arisen around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Unions Administration (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of the largest banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and pulled credit unions down.
“We are pleased that we have resolved this issue without the parties being brought to court,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank did not acknowledge its guilt.
The same goes for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is struggling to compensate for losses that result in billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and launched a lawsuit in the summer against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgages.
It is backed up by domestic loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when in 2007 a bubble burst in the U.S. real estate market.
American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the edge of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting a storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishing fraudsters.
The Federal Agency for the Financing of Housing (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It blames 18 major international banks for acquiring roughly $200 billion in collateral from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Deutsche Bank also faces a threat of prosecution by the FHFA over numerous agreements worth $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the Frankfurt-based bank to take responsibility for “significant losses,” but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares for a total of more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the largest U.S. investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report has changed his mind about investments in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for other companies’ IT departments.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investments were considered a knightly act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now received the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business channel CNBC, Buffett reported that since March, he has acquired IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said that even IBM knew nothing about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management, which managed to make profits even during the financial crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
For a considerable time, IBM has been focused on such high-income IT services as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, which is now more than 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He argued that he only invests in those companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, lubricants production and mechanical engineering.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a long list of the largest companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Municher Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old bought a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and with the help of skillful investments built one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct for making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
IBM's share price rose by one percent before opening markets after Buffett's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM also calls it, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the world’s most expensive high-tech companies along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
The Inevitable Danger
After the discovery of the "cell in Zwickau", the Turkish media began to doubt the power of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers talks about a “blood ideology” that is now rising to the surface again.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a response to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community in Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has brought to life long-forgotten fears. Such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks have not occurred since the burnings in Möln in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered has such a scale that it is not yet fully aware.
“The revival of bloody ideology?” was the headline of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret intelligence agent, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into a right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, mentioning the victims of racial hatred with a tacit picket in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin, in a ceremony involving German and Turkish politicians, celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on employment.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was like a gossip. "A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not miss the occasion to carry out this parallel.
"Begins to smell bad" is the name of Ahmet Kullahji's column.
He notes that people who paid taxes were killed and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
The behavior of the police and the subsequent successful seizure were subjected to harsh criticism on German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities did not think before about tracking suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather harsh rhetoric. "If they continue to act as clumsily, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves in an armed manner."
“It will be the best self-defense.”
“The world in Germany depends very much on how the entire network will be opened and on the legitimacy of the punishment,” Selen wrote.
The crimes in Melln and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the fact that the world in Germany was under threat.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zolingen is deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that they are in danger, and the Germans - that mistrust and indifference can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Don’t repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time mainly condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mellen.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the burnings in Zolingen, but attending the commemoration ceremony in Cologne, his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech calculated the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It is as if he has determined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has once again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks towards the current German state has deepened since then.
Clearly showing what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal in Zurich Lakes
Most of Europe’s leading risky banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been continuously fighting one or the other crisis ever since.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Weber probably didn't know he'd get that role.
In July, after his spectacular resignation as head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin work in an equally spectacular position – Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was clearly delighted, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its new strength and made some friendly comments to his future colleagues.
“UBS has managed to change for the better.”
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel.”
But in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
The UBS trader in London circumvented the bank’s security system and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take the position of chairman of the board in May, not in 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Webber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He was suddenly responsible for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved that it had long earned the title of “the biggest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very big — until recently it managed the world’s largest assets — and on the other hand, it hasn’t come out of scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank does not spare anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a good reputation.
The bank combined the image of a secretive and stable, but at the same time adept asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
As an investment bank, he joined the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking, who has long taught at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: “I have always cited UBS as a model of a good bank to my students.”
“Knowing what we know now, you might ask how I could have been so wrong.”
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffley – who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker – unexpectedly resigned from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has reported a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The bank has indeed managed to find investors – but investors whose services many bankers have recently politely abandoned – one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund hidden so far that not even its name has been reported.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got a lot worse.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, and board chairman Marcel Ospel – Switzerland’s second-highest-paying board chairman in 2006 – resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster occurred. Due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS faced the threat of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with compulsory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country realized the dramatic consequences of having huge banks in a small country.
Ultimately, UBS’ final balance sheet in 2007 was five times higher than all of Switzerland’s production (see chart).
“We won’t be able to save UBS a second time,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was ready to pass on the data of wealthy clients who may have been using the bank to evade taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unjustified business income plus fines.
UBS, therefore, more or less recognized that it was a tool for tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for wealthy customers – the veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer’s money has started.
In a few months, the bank has lost confidence in both of its main activities - in investing due to unsuccessful speculation and in managing assets as a result of assisting and encouraging tax evasion.
And only everything calmed down and it seemed that UBS managed to turn the situation, as happened this disaster with the scammer-trader. The single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear - risk management in the investment department is not working yet.
“The Adoboli incident has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of Germany’s largest banks also has no doubts: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t have a risk control tool.”
Precaution has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world’s largest assets – not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, regardless of whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine republic or not.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still corresponds to the image of a decent Swiss private bank – only it is a little bigger.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The bank’s head office is located in Zurich on Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Sprüngli you can find such jewellery companies as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years – from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Barr.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls are large leather sofas. Next to the emblem of the bank is a large indicator "Safe".
UBS knows what its customers need – reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss banking concepts – or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He wouldn’t want to see his name in the paper – like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big – in particular, in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
There is nothing for the Swiss to add to this.
"And if there is anything, it means they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it the first big profits - and then a fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money in the jungle of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million undertook the largest rescue operation in the country's history," Lukas Hessig wrote in his book Crash UBS.
Politicians have approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly the size of UBS.
Two of Switzerland’s three largest banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a wealthy but progressive bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so wealthy but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin the omnipotent wheel.
Two names are linked to UBS growth: Peter Wolffley, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always believed that Wolffley and Ospel are the team of dreams,” says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
“Wolfley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding of models and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instincts, went all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank.”
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolffley.
And Wolffley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the meetings of board members, at which Wolffley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed the "tournament table", where the successes of the banks were brought.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to do part of that journey.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trading.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weakness. By the parameter that in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has failed in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS got involved in an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in U.S. substandard securities.
This evolved into a large mechanism that combined securities based on U.S. mortgages and sold them on – continuing to bear the risks themselves.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS bought it until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to put the bank in order turned out to be more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts at UBS have become a children’s game with chairs and to this day remain unreliable.
Anyone who heads this huge bank faces an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Geiger’s banking analyst already has an idea – to give up investment banking, focus on asset management, and forget about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly tightened.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact only seen as a temporary decision when the bank unexpectedly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
Over time, he has managed to show character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he heads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to bring the investment bank back to the state it was in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a development concept.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself.
In public, he has only said that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe pull down U.S. stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe worsened the mood of U.S. investors earlier this week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome did not have much effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has dampened hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the embryo.
The general relief that followed the change of governments in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty – but now the problems are again coming to the fore, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed at 12,078 with a fall of 0.6 percent.
The barometer of the market during the trade ranged between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, falling by one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Index lost 0.8 percent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell 1.2 percent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in 17 eurozone countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting towards the end of growth.
The Statistical Office of Eurostat reported that in September, the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month.
This message threw American investors into skepticism. "We are not on the island. We depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe is unlikely to shake up the recession quickly and that banks are showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these concerns. In an interview with CNBC, he said it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it takes to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett dumped a principle that lasted more than a decade in the garbage bin and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM of more than ten billion dollars raised the stock price of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The stock closed, almost unchanged, at the level of $187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake.
The share price of his Berkshire Hathway investment company fell 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank cashed out almost all of its remaining shares of China’s Construction Bank, raising $6.6 billion.
The bank mainly plans to maintain its share capital with net profit from the sale to comply with more stringent regulations.
Aircraft manufacturer Boeing won by reducing losses on the Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777-series aircraft with a total cost of $18 billion.
Including the option to purchase another 20 aircraft, the total volume is actually $26 billion.
Approximately 710 million shares have changed owners on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of 719 companies rose, 2,281 fell, and 79 remained at the same level.
The shares of 630 companies ended with growth, 1913 with a fall, and 82 remained at the same level on the Nasdaq at a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Ingenious crows fill cities
Toys are considered problematic birds in many places. Experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to drive out of cities.
Some love birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining about dirt and noise in many settlements are becoming more and more.
The problem of birds, however, has not yet been solved.
At the first symposium on crows in the town of Ler in East Frisia, experts argued that it is no longer possible to drive crows out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected hamlets, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting down traditional nesting trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under guard.
In the town of Zeest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Jever, Diphoultz, Achim near Bremen and Lerre there are large colonies of more than 600 parent pairs.
A controversial project to shoot crows in Lera sparked disapproving newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described catching birds in traps and slaughtering them with sticks as a special act of cruelty.
“Ordinary movement and intimidation don’t give anything,” said architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Lera.
Cutting down the nests with jets of water or cutting down trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals are dispersed, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas."
Intimidation is possible only in the form of an exception near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're going to have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
In the distance from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says mayor Lera Wolfgang Kölner.
A combination of scaring birds away from living areas in need of protection and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Information stands instead of saws" was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational raven route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the life of highly intelligent ravens.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed her opinion on complaints about the noise produced by birds. "Noise conveys a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The mind and charm of these birds have entered the legends. Players often not only use the guns to seize the watched piece, but also make the guns themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested a measure of the bird’s mind on four burrows.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to knock on the board to get a mole larva.
Without special training, they knew the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the board.
In another experiment, clever players had to solve a more difficult task.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a mole larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds could not get prey with their beaks.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and used hooks to grab the bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of the four were able to cope with this from the first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal out for Euro 2012

Bosnians, who did not open an account in the first half hour, got their first chance thanks to attacking Edina Jacko.
The former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English championship Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball head to the bottom of the pole, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Yerevan scores for the Czech Republic
Then in the spotlight was Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergoldingen.
Following the attack on Elder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player had simulated, and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for the hand game after the Fool Fabiu Quentran - Misimovi<0xC4><0x87> implemented it.
After the interruption, the 2004 European Vice-Champions secured the account with four more goals.
Petr Yira<0xC4><0x8D>ek dismissed all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions are going to the European Championships for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled at the team of coach Michael Bilek and the legions of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning, which could be catastrophic.
The goalkeeper Petr Chekh in the 9th minute thanks to the instant reflex prevented the potential car goal of Tomas Sivok.
The best chances for Montenegro were when the duo of Stefan Joveti<0xC4><0x87> and Dejan Damjanovi<0xC4><0x87> were on the field.
Damyanovich in the 40th minute struck from the edge of the penalty area and almost scored a goal for the Czech.
After the interruption of the pole saved the already shattered world-class goalkeeper Czech after the forward of FC Seoul left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than 0-0 in Zagreb.
Although there is virtually no doubt now that the coach of the team Gus Hiddink will now free a seat on the bench of the team that reached the third place in 2002, the Croatians for the fourth time are in the final round of the European Championship.
The Turks almost managed to perfectly start in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long-distance strike in the seventh minute hit the stand, and attacker Kazym Kazym failed to hit the ball into the grid.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly took control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legionnaires Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field together with Mario Manjukic from the Wolfsburg team, who gave way to Ivan Perisic from Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trappists go to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro since Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - who already looked confident in their place after a 4:0 victory in the first stage - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Konstantin Vasilyev from the team of guests compared the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but only in the 23rd minute Robbie Keen from Los Angeles scored his first clean goal.
At the last minute, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from taking Ireland forward.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and nearly double its workforce in China in the next few years.
The Dax-listed company said on Thursday it plans to invest about $2 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 billion) by 2015.
“We will create more opportunities for research and development and hire thousands of people,” said Bill McDermott, one of SAP’s CEOs, in a statement at a consumer show in Beijing.
A staff of 2,500 should grow to 4,500.
The global market leader in industrial software plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this booming country, there are about 4,000 SAP customers from more than 176,000 around the world.
China’s growth expectation is an important component of the company’s 2015 strategy, which is included in the Dax listing.
SAP plans to increase turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the company from Waldorf earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The software provider business, with 55,000 employees worldwide, looks better than ever before.
SAP has been in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to change the scale of our operations,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth by relying on computerization in China.”
Mass murders – the human dimension
A tense and very good new book by Peter Englund, Beauty and Sorrow: The Personal History of World War I, begins with a long list of actors whose heart is frozen.
Here’s a tip on how to read on: carefully trim this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely as Mr. Englund narrates, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon in those moments when, as one of these men and women, you will fall off the road and be lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as “work on anti-history.”
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, clever journalists or discussions of tactics and combat equipment.
It's not so much a book about what it was, he explains, as "a book about what it looked like." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and the state of mind."
The book “Beauty and Sorrow” brought together the experience of 20 military years of more or less understated men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and servants.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses an arm or a leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives flash here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some at this time are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the idea that World War I was only a heavy trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully gives the panorama of other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are beehives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is the tsetse flies.
This is an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling like smokeless powder.
When a canon is heard nearby, and you are a woman and are at home with children, will you stay in place or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening and why it is necessary to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," says Mr. Englund, "is filled with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, compulsive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Grief" traces the fate of people such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German Open Sea Fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs, letters and other materials already published.
The stories of their lives may be frightening or exciting, but they are highly vivid thanks to the small moments and excerpts collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, erzac everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, counterfeit aluminum, non-genuine rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about messy food in Germany.
He describes "meat of pressed rice cooked in lamb fat (and decorated with false bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes cut with wood."
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories tell about honor and courage.
One American notices in himself a craving for cruelty and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, it is what men were created for, and not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a bestseller and claim that this show is a target and
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he is likely to die and no one will notice it or be saddened.
“When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But it is, on the contrary, terribly similar to "a convicted man who is hanged in secret."
Other comments relate to the old Europe, which is crumbling, and to the new types of fear.
"The conflict has become more and more an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war of factories."
He notes the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiaria of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-worn suit who arranges a massacre while sitting at a desk.”
People act in an unforeseen way: lowly acts are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke of the soldiers who tried in every possible way to seize venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea manure, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"The desperate ones rubbed him in the eyes, which often led to lifelong blindness."
Translated from the Swedish Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible but nebroska, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war “has liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's "The Great War and Modern Memory" or such novels as Erich-Marie Remark's "On the Western Front Without Change," rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unpatterned pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in non-artistic literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's as if he's gone from the book to a page with a list of characters, took it out of your hands, and burned it with a flashlight.
After the previous mistake - a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some in protective helmets.
The night time from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zukotti Park was supposed to have the fewest people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, the rest of whom were first told they were going to the exercises.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, his presence underscored how much importance the Police Department attached to the operation.
There could not be a repeat of such episodes in recent weeks as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy to the occupiers.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to free the protesters of Zukotti Park began.
The authorities were preparing, watching as the occupations unfolded in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on Randels Island, counting on Zukotti.
Authorities have increased the number of so-called riot trainings — counter-terrorism measures that provide for the rapid movement of large numbers of police — with Lower Manhattan in mind.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute", - said a source familiar with the orders, in which the task was mentioned only as "training".
“The few cops I know who have been called to the case have not been told that they are being sent to Zukotti Park,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest positions in the department.”
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On October 14, authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters who rushed in ahead of schedule after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday was attended by members of various police units, including forces from the districts - police teams that were usually used to control the criminal surroundings of the area.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1 hour of the night a good time to attack.
“It was the right thing to do when there were fewer people in the park,” he said.
Rescue cars with headlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pike-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
Projectors and pre-recorded announcements from loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters simply picked up their belongings and left.
Police said the tents had not been moved until 1:45 p.m., giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other groups of police, eyewitnesses said, gathered around the perimeter to enter the park in case arrests were needed.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the Police Department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police operate and that the police treated them rudely.
Mr. Brown said that the cars with the TV cameras on Church Street, along the park’s western border, could have taken the picture.
When police went west through a pile of protesters’ personal belongings, including bags, plastic mats and plastic bags full of clothes, Sanitation Department teams followed her, picking up what was thrown away.
Some of the protesters, who refused to leave, were dragged out, photos of this soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp clasped their hands together.
And two men tied themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
To cut the locks, rescuers were called.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “violation of public order and resistance to detention,” he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the police investigation department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operation," Mr. Brown said.
The second group of policemen were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to enter.
The fences were placed on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw police expand the perimeter even beyond the borders of Zukotti Park from these positions.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night took place south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, eyewitnesses said, were exhaling air from the tyres of the police van.
At one point a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The union of school staff will sue the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school service workers who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that redundancies were unnecessary and discriminatory because of disproportionate impact on schools where poor students are studying.
The trial is probably the last recourse available to the union of district council 37 trying to cancel dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a coordinator of work with parents and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on October 7, as a result of what union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds.
The city officials categorically denied the allegation.
At hearings in the City Council last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the redundancies were part of the budget they signed in June.
One member of the board pared, telling him that nowhere in the budget there were indications that the school support staff would be fired.
The 37-member district council said it had filed a complaint warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against it; a press conference will be held Wednesday to announce a formal filing of a lawsuit to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department and list eight temporary workers as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and could therefore not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint made available to the New York Times, the union focused on a number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, arguing that poor schools have lost more.
He points out that while there were no redundancies in Staten Island and few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school support staff lost their seats in Braunsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in South B.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants who worked at the 36th Free High School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “It’s not areas of wealthy parents who can find the money to make up for budget failures.”
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26% this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it counted additional funding for every poor student who enrolled in school.
The union also argues that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice allowing the dismissal of coordinators for working with parents.
The notification used the word "excess", although "excess" is more often said when a teacher moves from the school's payroll to a list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six coordinators of work with parents were fired,” the plaintiff’s note says, “and not just transferred.”
The mission is over, Congress ready for an agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something related to the Libyan uprising.
All it took was for the uprising to succeed, the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is due to consider a resolution tabled by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent, Connecticut) of the Americans.
“The purpose of this resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"This is a confirmation of their support for their democratic aspirations on both sides."
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has yet been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House about drafting a series of resolutions approving or denouncing the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a significant majority of the two parties and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the US operation in Libya.
This left the U.S. mission in some sort of legislative purgatory — when Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually kick the ground out of it.
Events overcame the indecisiveness of Congress.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
NATO’s mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate is now ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "admires the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary resilience in the pursuit of freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people.
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Affairs Council or will they split legislators, like the June bill?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee.
A spokesman for Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is due to vote this week for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by House Member Bob Goodlet (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else to be put to a plenary vote of the Congress of that convocation.
Other legislators have not yet been able to bring their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Goodlat Amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this convocation.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments in the House of Representatives alone and some more on "control over federal spending."
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors – mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resumes – the opportunity to brag that they have “proposed” such a proposal.
The budget control act, passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of Congress, and Member of the House of Representatives José Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as well as another banning the burning of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states object to them.
As much as members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are not progressing any faster than in previous years.
In the 111th congress, lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th, they made 66.
This rate is fading from the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were not more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was adopted, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced in Congress in 1789.
"A Sabbath, but not defeated," said Giffords in his first television interview after the assassination attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot her in an emphasis on a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona), on Monday night, appeared on the federal channel, whispered a melody from a Broadway show.
Having appeared on the 20/20 ABC News with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formulate suggestions and needed help walking.
The program showed her a difficult way to recover from a bullet injury that broke the skull and punctured the left side of the brain, passing from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the bill on the debt limit.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult."
When asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords replied, “Very well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special 20/20, which was shown on the eve of the release of the new book "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special issue reported on the recovery of Giffords after the January 8 shooting.
On the video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Shake your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word: "What."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word - "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by ABC shows that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: we see a congressman sing along with doctors "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she did not remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband said he was reading a Giffords article in the newspaper about the March 12 shooting, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at the time.
Suspected assailant Gerd Lee Lafner is held in Missouri prison and undergoes compulsory treatment pending trial.
“A lot of people have died,” said Giffords Sawyer.
"Heavy, heavy, heavy."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, “I’m defeated.”
“I said, ‘Gabbie, you’re not defeated,’” Kelly said.
You're just beaten.
And you'll go through it, you'll recover, and you'll come back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more pity than respect.
The event was a holiday on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
According to the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines were stationed around it.
The audience in their tuxes applauded him standing.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Salzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
The senior military officer at the concert, which also included the then chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The very opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been established between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired, American public.
Soldiers are being praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has its price, say the soldiers.
The audience is increasingly behaving as if they feel sorry for people in shape.
"We are not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is about to leave for Afghanistan, said in a statement.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us like unhappy people.”
This is a sensitive topic for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or dissatisfied with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat as part of the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Canshne warned them that people not in the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration because they have crushed rebels and been to exotic places.
Others will wonder if “under the mask of a cruel evil veteran” is hiding, said Kenshun, who fought in Iraq and, on his return, held a high government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could withstand the strain of responsible work in Washington right after the campaign.
Kenshn recalls how he told his sons: “When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect.”
The embarrassment experienced by the military comes in part from American indifference to wars.
Victories on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that is little familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as it was quite common in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Burneau, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public mainly focuses on the depth of the soldier’s suffering.
Soldiers are estimated by the number of expeditions they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the scale of the losses.
The army faces increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week's historic court hearings are set to decide whether a lawsuit will be filed against 28 men and women against the army on charges of non-resistance to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the following.
First-class sergeant Elizabeth Lyman, 25, was allegedly raped at night by her co-worker at 11 weeks of pregnancy.
It was in October 2008, she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after having dinner with a friend and met a fellow man carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
“It was a red flag,” Lyman says.
But the native of Texas dismissed his concerns.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"It's a pity that I didn't listen to my instincts."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman’s room, the man approached her in the back, collapsed and raped, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be eagerly awaiting a court ruling at a historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether to sue his predecessor and former defense minister, Dodgson.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by attorney Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., did not include 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were subjected to rape or threat of sexual violence by their co-workers, and that the army did not owe them.
Burke says she's targeting the top ranks of the army because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the people who can wipe out the cult of violence?
Burke also says she has been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may take part in future lawsuits.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case — putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak — it would open up a lot of cases if needed to maintain pressure.
The defense team from the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to terminate the case.
Judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy—mainly that former or current soldiers cannot file an army claim for damages inflicted on the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision by the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the story.
Since the 1950s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially banned from fighting, this division exists only in the words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women-soldier teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacts with local women in the combat zone.
The result: between the two wars, 150 female soldiers were killed, two-thirds of them in battle.
It’s time for the military to become modern too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are being prepared.
In Yale Law School, the Veterans Law Service Seminar prepares a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a gender-hate atmosphere.
Separately, the non-profit association of American veterans of the Vietnam War is preparing a lawsuit against the army, which is centered on the diagnosis of "personality changes" that are placed on victims of violence to remove them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwanta from the human rights group Ozark.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Affairs Office, accusing it of discriminatory treatment of pension applications from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence while in service.
Nine separate bills proposing a series of measures were submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
3,158 rape attempts were reported in 2010, according to the Ministry of Trafficking's Sexual Violence Prevention and Combating Service.
But, as you know, attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon estimates that this figure is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also investigates the percentage of legal cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases came to court - twice as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call the attacks on them only the first in a series of other injuries.
In Lyman's case, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape 11 times separately to the gang of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of rape evidence, and the blood of the attacker - from the cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge at a hearing where she was asked if she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive characterization to the accused, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was giving birth now - I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commander saying, 'It wasn't a trial on him. It was a trial on me.'"
Lyman was ordered to turn to a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a change in personality, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an unfavourable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case filed by Lyman and her lawsuit buddies will move forward is a difficult question, says John Terley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
He added: “I think they are able to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been criticizing the Feres Doctrine all my life.
The army has lagged behind for decades because it lacks the incentives and deterrents it imposes.
He adds: “The odds are largely against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing isn't in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform,” she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens sooner.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breivik was an ordinary guy exposing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to committing a mass murder in Norway in July that killed 77 people, appeared at his first open trial.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was far from alone on the net: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack behind his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
It's easy - you just have to go to Facebook.
“We realized that it was easy to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European cyber-populism by the British DEMOS Research Center.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site’s advertising tool to highlight the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy — which marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team discovered half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then pushed them to show an ad, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad offered the user a survey that asked questions about their level of education, their attitude to violence, and their optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – even without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not as striking: right-wing online supporters are mostly male young people dissatisfied with immigration.
But unexpectedly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind a monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends that are expressed in likes, posts on the wall, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook’s “super-actual information” is triggering a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles titled a site by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you can’t access on the street with a notebook.
“In the past, if you wanted to question people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to join the party, and they would never accept you,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook excludes all of this – you are addressing them directly.”
Others say that with the help of this site it would be possible to identify and investigate social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Meghan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken feats on Facebook were significantly more at risk for alcoholism than students who remained silent about it.
Moreno suggests that student peers, such as their hostel mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunk statuses.
“You can’t solve the problem without revealing it,” said Dimitri Hristokis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
"We found a way to identify children at risk that we would not otherwise have detected."
Facebook also constantly extracts various kinds of data about its users.
The data processing team of the site has processed statistics on the status of relationships and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in mid-2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using information that only they have access to - cyber-liberty champions have long insisted on the fact that the site should make its extensive call.
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for the ability to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined norms for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about what a researcher can look at their profiles,” says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using publicly available student pages on Facebook.
"As far as they could imagine, it was just between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that the object of research is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much information in the profile and on the user’s page is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selvin said.
That’s why, despite years of technology research, Selvin thinks notebooks and pens are still the best research tools you can use.
“Nothing can replace getting out into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
“It is assumed that social research is about social, and most of the social is still taking place offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Bering Breivik to appear in court for first time
Anders Bering Breivik, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance and Knights Templar of Norway,” he told 500 people in the courtroom.
“I object to the court because you got your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I admit actions, but I don't admit guilt."
Judge Torkyel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to detain Breivik for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came here to find answers to their questions.
“I thought he looked cold and inhuman,” one of the survivors told NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but I personally got a little bit easier after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik maintained calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s odd idea that he was part of a large “resistance” movement, the judge ruled he was not crazy and said there was no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
Some may be reassured by the fact that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is now feeling.
“I would like him to look like a monster, but it’s not,” one victim’s relative said.
“It would be a lot easier if it were.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Showed at the Theatre This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can count as the biggest discovery in a newly discovered interview, which was recalled in anticipation of previews in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was of course a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from the "disease of thinking that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] a huge amount of work from a great product separates the idea."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the TV series Triumph of the Nerds about the emergence of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he was already working for his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of the mass development of the Internet.
While a small portion of Kringley's interviews were used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interviews disappeared during transportation.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a full VHS copy was found in the director’s garage.
This footage, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: A Lost Interview, which is released at Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually prepared here to expose his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers—thoughts of 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say the least.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringle’s questions, forcing him to move more quickly to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar era, iPods and iPhones, the Lost Interview is something sinisterly prophetic when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It’s one thing to read about Jobs’ post-mortem assessments, but there’s something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, an alarming dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"All the time in business, I've been asking, 'Why are you doing this?' And the answers you're always getting, 'Oh, that's just how it's done.'
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to streamline reporting at Apple.
Disturbed by the way of recording expenses, often starting with “standard expenses” that were taken from the ceiling and then tailored with “clarification,” he created an automated structure that ensured that they would be able to track business expenses down to the smallest detail.
A joke about the Pope:
Jobs talks in detail about the "blue box" he crafted with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and call long distances for free.
Much has been written about the device before, but Jobs' euphoria here when describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a phone-machine, ordering a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
“We’ve covered the globe half a dozen times, and you were yelling at the phone machine, and it went into the next phone machine a minute later,” Jobs says with a smile.
“We were young, and all we learned was that we could craft something that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us knew a little bit, but we could master the little thing that could control the big thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple could ever have come out without it.
Jobs goes on to describe in detail one famous outing that he and Wozniak practically coped with by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope on the phone, trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and Bill Hewlett’s cold calling):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to assemble the frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer".
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electron beam tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to drive to HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for it.
About Improvised Innovation:
In several places the interview Jobs talks about the invention of new products in the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of circuit boards, a buyer asked him to assemble an entire computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think about both assembly and delivery of ready-made devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced while developing a computer mouse:
“I remember the fierce controversy... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300] and I was fed up with it, and I went out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Some of the companies that are losing energy:
Long before he led Apple’s revival, Jobs predicted exactly how many industry leaders would go wrong in their vision of the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who ultimately come to run the companies, and the people making the product are pushed out of the decision-making arena.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is displaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products – the required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could have been ten times bigger, it could have been Microsoft in the 90s...
They were defeated by victory.
About innovation as a form of art:
“A great idea is separated from a great product by a huge amount of skillful work ... when you unfold a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises you need to make – some things you won’t be able to make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in mind — these concepts — connecting them all together...
Ultimately, it’s all about the taste – it’s all about trying to express yourself in the best way people have ever produced, and later – trying to bring it into what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to become the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it weren’t for information technology, they would have done amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner with Opponents of the Health Act While the Court Is Considering the Case
The day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial issue whether it would listen to President Obama’s denial of the health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were honored for a lunch sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions submitted for consideration.
One of the issues on the agenda was a petition backed by 26 states challenging a swift health review passed by Congress last year, a law that brought conservative activists across the nation together.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour turnaround is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an interference in the presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and argue that health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was deputy attorney general during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a long-standing group that constantly advocates conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the luncheon represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court meeting in the case.
Among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the health care law, was present.
Honorary guests for lunch, Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the events of the Society of Federalists for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical norms.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest or be mentioned in the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia’s and Thomas’s apparent closeness to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This overwhelming breach of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the General Case.
“The judges drank and dined at an official money-raising event with lawyers, whose cases are now being heard in court.”
Their emergence and support in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with groups appearing in cases such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Jeannie, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that it is an ethical issue regarding Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the level of a first instance court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to be heard in this case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing Receives Record 18 Billion Aircraft Orders
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal - more than $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is an aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the price of all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold rush of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest in the dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft - 50 two-passenger aircraft Boeing 777.
An incredible order was received from the airline Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total price to $ 26 billion, Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Later on Monday, Boeing said, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The current price for six aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
“It’s really very good for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neil Dior.
“The quality of these particular buyers is quite high.”
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for planes, but also the rise in fuel prices, which usually causes damage to airlines, as this is one of their biggest expense items, is not so detrimental because the country makes money on high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel their orders when prices rise, Diora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
Emirates’ order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS’ attempts to undermine its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing’s victory at the air show came four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axial load after buyers demanded to increase the lifting capacity and range of the flight.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Apparently Lost in Michoacán Election
Luisa Maria Calderón claims that drug dealers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderón’s sister appears to have failed to run for Governor of Michoacán during fierce state elections, and she said on Monday that drug dealers helped push the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the seat of governor of the western state is called Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
“The interference of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” Luisa Maria Calderón said in a radio interview the day after the vote.
“They intimidated our candidates, our election workers... They took ballot boxes, set obstacles... and forced people to vote” for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing for a return, and winning Michoacan is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just slightly surpassed Calderon, who led the rankings before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or PND, led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the Left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now owns the governor’s seat, came in third – a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links with drug dealers and urged other candidates to acknowledge the results.
In Michoacan, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines dominated for a long time.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still going on.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderón, and several candidates left the local election race because of fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how awful the Michoacan elections may look, victory will give the party a driving impetus.
The man to represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, “I think this victory should be very inspiring in the run-up to next year.”
ADB persuades Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has urged India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term downturn that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB office in Manila, said the two fastest-growing major economies should “do everything they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that BRICS countries view Europe’s difficulties “impartially” and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"It concerns all of us."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable.”
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowings have risen threateningly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe’s debt crisis has sparked fears that it could lead the world economy back into recession, and has led to calls from leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of bonds from the EU's financial assistance fund, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided enormous power in the negotiations for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a reduction in foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We have great goals and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a possible option, it’s a prerequisite because where we will find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that it makes no sense for developing economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Warsaw, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be very difficult from a political point of view to help Europe for the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will learn that the Greeks are retired at 50 and going to the seaside holidays, and that will not be well received,” he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, losing enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast for 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces “lowering risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “emergency plans” to protect themselves from the downturn and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Dreadful Pentagon Warnings of Potential Reductions in Defense Costs
Defense Minister Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress warned that expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to civilian assailants.
The Pentagon is already accustomed to cutting $450 billion over the next decade, but now fears that additional cuts of $600 billion or more may be unavoidable if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress’s failure to adopt a budget agreement and the so-called sequestration resulted in a 23% general reduction and the cessation of many new projects.
"Such a sharp reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unworkable -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building -- and will seriously damage other modernization attempts," Panetta wrote to senators.
“We will also have to lay off many of our staff, and since the cuts will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay off staff to achieve the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious damage to combat readiness.”
The cuts will ultimately affect military units, Panetta said.
"Although military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets," Panetta warned.
“The contract staff will be reduced, which will result in the cancellation of the contracts and the supervision contract that supports the troops.”
“State personnel will be cut, leading to delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of the sequester in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as a leading world military power.”
"We stand steadfastly against these draconian actions," the senators said in a joint statement Monday night when they released a letter from Panetta.
“It’s not an option we can live with, and it’s not an option we should impose on ourselves.”
“The sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter or the senators’ latest warnings will lead to a budget compromise or intensify calls for the Pentagon to be freed from cuts, we’ll see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about possible cuts, although he came to work in the Pentagon leadership after years of budgetary scrutiny in Congress and the White House and realizing that he faced difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister drew a grim picture of what could follow - troops with a shell, but without a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a unit without bullets."
"It's a wing of an aircraft without sufficiently trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from an unsustainable fighting spirit, poor readiness and unable to fight potential enemies.”
“Basically, it encourages aggression.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he voiced new details of how the cuts "generate significant operational risks: slow down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limit our ability to be first in the deployment and response of operations".
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single strike fighter F35, a planned new bomber, a next-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone battleship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace the hammer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion over 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch Lies
A runaway look at the latest headlines shows how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is engaged in challenging allegations of sexual harassment by several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration has been charged with false witnessing for allegedly concealing that a retired football coach raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama, with the microphone on, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
A lie destroys careers and shakes countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner posed as a fool by denying his claims, which was quickly refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to cover up extramarital affairs.
Again, none of those living at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, accused of lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of scams on exams at school and college are commonplace.
There were occasions when teachers gave students answers to tests in order to have themselves a good assessment of the results of their activities.
Teachers, who must teach the opposite, send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
Within a day, research shows, you may be lied to 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie for salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detection of a lie or deduction into a lie is a necessary skill for everyone, both for personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game, similar to, say, charades, where you need to shout "Fucked!", the detection of lies is a serious direction of knowledge, based on scientific data collected over the last six decades in prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physics.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been disproved.
The liars look in the eyes.
They don’t always blush, blush, or blush.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that the liars are difficult to notice and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can come to the truth by observing the structure of claims, the mimicry, the structure of questions, and the temporal characteristics.
I've spent several years exploring scientific discoveries in an extensive and ever-growing segment of lying knowledge, and it's clear that lying detection is a modern skill that's easy to learn and that helps orient in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, management, overhauling.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel free, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone’s feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried (but the lies they tell are most often blunt).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called the "determination of the original state."
This helps provide a starting point for evaluating changes further.
Watch the pose, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly tapping your feet in a normal state, then you will not be making unfair accusations when you see a tapping of your feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Scammers can fix the top of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, lean out, change their posture in a certain way, or show “relief after the interview” — this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture when all the questions are complicated.
Investigators often forge an end-of-interview signal to simply look at that relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson backed down and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, leading to her search across the country.
Inviting people can also use distance in speeches: “I didn’t have a sexual relationship with this woman...Ms. Lewinsky” or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely catchable.
Someone may use “qualifying language” when answering a difficult question: “Well ... honestly ... as far as I know ... as far as I know.”
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to uncover a lie, but mastering the skill of detecting a deception is possible.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not becoming a victim of skilled scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan for the construction of the pipeline needs to be revised after the threat of the US to postpone its approval
A few days later, after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico — provoking the anger of trade unions but reassuring environmentalists — the company, which is going to rebuild the pipeline, says it is about
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Nebraska Sand Hills area and is confident the project will still get approval.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the State Department said last week that it would postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
“This is a real step forward,” said Fox News congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
A new environmental review commissioned by the State Department is likely to delay the decision until 2013, after the election next year, although authorities have denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision a call for the State Department, and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It will ship 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To do this, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by trade unions that hope for about 20,000 oil-pipeline-related jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposing the plan are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Hills and Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study showed that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry said that the Department’s auditor had ordered a separate examination of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
Another is whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate as it was related to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle sued for allegedly causing her child nausea from fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patty LaBelle started rioting in the lobby of their Manhattan home, frightening their young daughter to the point where she was overwhelmed by fear.
Lady Marmalade’s tyranny frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she endured “personality change, sleep disorder” and “a strong fear of strangers,” her family in Manhattan’s Supreme Court said.
This happened on November 10 last year when working-scene actor Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to embark on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me in the back and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle furiously made a statement to a pregnant woman.
“She said aggressively, ‘You shouldn’t have left your daughter at the door,’” said Rosanna Monk.
"I said, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She became furious and began to use slander -- word for C and word for F -- in raised tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Geneva was starting to get hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the mother of the child said.
LaBelle jumped at her mother -- who was still holding Geneva -- and her companions had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so much that she was overwhelmed, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a note of apology, but received no response.
Lawyers and representatives of LaBelle do not answer calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took over the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it receives to charity for children with cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBelle accountable for her actions," Davis said.
"Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially in relation to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate change has slowed the economy.
During the first year of Mario Lopez’s rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labor market increased, foreign funding declined and the economy weakened.
2011 is the year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as related to the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, also called the year of change, which gave rise to great hopes for the development of the economy, but given the unfavorable climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but there was a decline in economic development.
The low temperatures in February have not only resulted in loss of millions for the agricultural sector, but they have limited the potential for growth of the state economy, causing a decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent overall in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historic decline of 31.16 percent in other sectors of agriculture, which is expected to increase the growth of the economy.
According to a report on areas affected by frost provided by the Council of Mexico for Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected entirely, and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state of 18.000 before. according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, in the first three quarters of September was recorded an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55.053 inhabitants of Sinaloa were unemployed, before 5.
Decreased liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is plagued by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions taken in public policy.
“What we’re seeing now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to a number of factors, including the loss of market liquidity in order to limit the resources imposed by a law that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, because people who illegally own dollars, he said, it’s not easy to work with them.
Detained Immigration
Lopez Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the United States has been limited, primarily due to difficulties with entry, and in the second - since, once they have entered, they already face a lot of difficulties in finding a job result, so a group of people stays in and requires jobs.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of Sinaloa’s labor market is getting worse if we take into account the large number of violations that prevail in the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the active population of the state works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and registration violations, another reminder about working in the state is low wages; the state has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos, much lower than the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high rate of unemployment in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July, the state FDI amounted to $ 630.697.
For its part, the State Government’s Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17.280,000 pesos of investments during the year, which were mainly incurred by service companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government requested in July during the state congress approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, at the local level only 2,600 million pesos were approved by the state, and by November the economy was not expected to exceed.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez demonstrates the lack of opportunities of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011, there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really low, it takes a lot of work to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012, we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to reconcile the efforts of everyone and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be better for us."
The slowdown of the economy
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early frosts have halted the state’s economy this year and its efficiency and growth have been limited.
"The low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not becoming fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and therefore at the end of the year we close it below our expectations," he said.
Revision of direction
Theodore Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue its most dynamic manufacturing activity.
“In general, we found that we were working on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Upcoming work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining a future direction in order to better guide the government’s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved and that I can say that some work has been done and I think the government is aware that there is much more to be done," he said.
He was sentenced to eight kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days' income - such a sentence was issued to a citizen of Navolato for the possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office reported that the convicted drug trafficker, Omar Alexis Valensuela Sandal, convicted of a crime against health, in this case the possession of marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valencia Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during a patrol of Cypriano Valdes Street in front of Post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the wheel of a white pickup car, in which he carried a black bag in a box in the car, and on the passenger seat - a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the confiscation was handed over to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be held in the Centre for the Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
You have to make contributions to work.
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of remaining unfinished or long-delayed due to a lack of funds, Miguel Angel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although work programmes had so far been developed, they were at risk as the State Government was unable to make the corresponding contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent should be paid by the staff, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for work, so there was still a possibility of delay in completing them.
"They have to invest nearly 12 million, and although the year is ending, they didn't give us a penny, when they were supposed to give us a part from the beginning of July," he said, "so as not to delay, we started work and they have moved very forward, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it was supposed to make, so at the beginning of the reign of the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the administration of the state.
“This happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn’t have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued to evolve, and this year to access these programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state owes,” he explained.
Although the State authorities had an obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the interest on them would come as soon as possible.
“They have to make nearly 12 million, and even though the year is ending, they haven’t given us a penny.”
The court will approve the "transition to digital television" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court has rejected constitutional claims put forward by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which postpones the so-called “transition to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to override it have not been cast.
A minority of four ministers, including President Juan Silva Mesa, said President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers by issuing a decree detailing the steps to transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were dismissed due to the absence of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television program is a right enshrined in the law by the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the law.
Only Salvador, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the meeting of ministers, it was also decided to reject the demand of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive cannot determine by general rules the measures to be prepared by the state administration.
“I also don’t think that if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” and reminded that planning public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the management of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years has led to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying the transition, he said, would mean deferring the benefits of digital transformation, which includes meeting societal needs, which has a not only technical dimension, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic management, includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into the state executive power."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and did so with the help of the executive branch, despite the presence of highly specialized technical institutions.
From this it cannot be concluded that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competences of Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacan analyzed the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data transmitted to the PPP, the difference between the first and second seats in the governor ' s elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes, which amount to 879 out of a total of 6,074 minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is real, as far as the election process this year in Michoacán is concerned, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PRP), the difference between the first and second place in the governoral elections is only 27 per cent of the total votes, even without counting 8 votes.
In light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IWM), Maria de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Lianderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral corps approved a set of principles to align local rules with federal electoral reform.
As it should be recalled, Michoacan did not pass the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline of their entry into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has made a statement that the state did not include its publication in the law in time.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJU) ruled on a constitutional claim put forward by the local legislature, calling the vote of a state representative on constitutional reform "invalid and illegal" as he has no right to "allow or support them".
In an interview on the possibility of "vote by vote", Maria de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Lyanderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IWM, it would be possible for the local electoral body to present a partial or full count of votes.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more electoral ballots may be made on the condition that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no voting and counting minutes in the ballot or it is not with the chairman; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of votes counted in all electoral votes may be taken when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate-winner of the elections in question and those who received the second place in the vote is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or coalition of the candidate who has submitted the second vote.
The total number of votes shall also be recalculated if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate took the second place, in the event that the re-election ballots which were taken into account are excluded.
It is worth noting that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PPP, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16%, even without counting 129 votes out of the total number in 923 minutes.
His Last Will <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortes arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening; a visitation and a quiet mass were held on Monday.
According to the family, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was to have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortes family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel’s ashes arrived at the chapel located on the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m. he passed the examination of the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during his high school education.
"His desire was to return to Saltiello, and to have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Cortez Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her opinion, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to enroll in the College of Aviation in Sapopane, Khalisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that his head was spinning even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for the ceremony of his relative's diplomas, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving an airplane.
He is taken to the last path.
Shots from guns were fired at the honor of the lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortes Basio, headed by Governor Jorge Torres López, the men of the village and the government of the state, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the students of the school.
Basio Cortes was recently killed when a helicopter he operated crashed, along with the Provincial Government Secretary, José Francisco Blake Moray, and six others, all representatives of this ministry.
At 18:05 the remains of Basio Cortez (cremated), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral desk of the members of the Mexican Air Force headed by Major James Martinez, on the esplanade of the training school, where he was already awaited by his family, including his daughter Aman.
Three bodies found abandoned at NL Kaderaita farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadete Jimenez, Nuevo León.
The find was found on the 1.5-kilometer highway to Santiago, on an elevation in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people passing by noticed that in the village house, whose wall was painted in beige and brown, the gates were immediately opened.
Looking inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately let the relevant authorities know.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Nearly one meter was the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there were no shells on the site.
On the fence of the village house there are signs addressed to one organized criminal group another, also in it and in the gates there are several holes from bullets.
11 arrested in Kaderete
The Ministry of National Security identified 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kadereita and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, "fraud" and secret burials.
According to published information, initially eight people were detained in the Los Alvero colony on November 11, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another event happened on November 12 at 06:00 a.m., military personnel were patrolling the village of Stare Rancho in Kadereita when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the cabin.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, ammunition and 18 ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on public land of La Pravda, who, seeing the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Terran, Hina and Kadereita.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic catastrophe.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the Italian president to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic catastrophe and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive body will take its positions.
Monty said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say explicitly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well outlined," he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than usual, as Italy has been battling a political and financial crisis that has brought the size of their debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Under pressure from Monti to rush, unstable markets set BTP Italy’s bond yield by 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be rescued.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after meeting with Monti: “We have said that we will actively support this government.”
We believe that this government is Italy’s last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty’s chances of success were largely based on the support of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts should lead to a good outcome,” Angelino Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
Support for the LDP, Italy’s largest party, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the technocratic government majority that Monti is forming.
The Parliamentary Support
The new Monty government should have strong parliamentary support for reforms that will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts can lead to a new and destructive attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up the pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monty began consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He will finish the series of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy’s debt value has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 billion in government debt would be too much for the eurozone’s modern financial defenders.
Monty said his government would exist until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to carry out reforms before appointing new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should be composed only of technical specialists, a testament to their dissatisfaction with the fact that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties complicates the attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more experience than the Tikos.
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players claimed to have played 50 matches.
A slight contrast to Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 players called by both countries for a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly rankings, have a whole list of A-class qualifying games, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one to hold 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium named after Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish footballers playing in the All-Star League and in the strong Premier League clubs of England have been very active in the league and in local cup competitions this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the Champions League.
To this, it is worth adding the experience of the Spanish Furia in a difficult qualification in the Euro or World Championship.
Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that leads the list in the Spanish team goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (match, lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernández, a Barcelona player, has 106 games.
Casillas and Javi were recognized as UEFA’s top scorers last week along with another Iberian team player, Subissarreta, with 126 matches and goalkeeper Schalke Raoul González with 102.
Almost approaches the hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From Costa Rica next to Michael Umana, left-handed Junior Diaz with 48 games and bomber Brian Ruiz - with 45.
Next, only five have crossed the line in 30 games: Kaylor Navas at 31, Randall Asofeifa at 32, Michael Barrantes at 31, Carlos Hernández at 36 and José Luis Lopez at 35.
Remains.
More than 30 games in Spain with Gerard Pica (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cassorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
In the team with less than 30 finishes on the field there is Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Horda Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet made their debut.
Leading player of Spain David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who scored the most points, twice as many as Carlos Hernández and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
The quintet included the country in a tour in honor of the twentieth anniversary of his career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band says it’s also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
This was the assertion of bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is on the territory of South America as part of a 20-year tour and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday, 20th.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Los Angeles team The X and the local group Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full decryption of which is available online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, is it a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once – on vacation, it’s a beautiful country and I think we can stay there for a few days.
We are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask about it because there is some commitment to the band; fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of tension to your visit?
“Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have taken place over the past two weeks.
We had some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle when it comes to these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as Mexico, these are great places for surfing, this is how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you did a great show with a lot of songs.
What do you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we have no limits on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour marks 20 years of your career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yeah, sure.
“First, I don’t think any of us could ever have imagined that we’d be in a rock band and that we’ve been doing this for more than 20 years makes it like a dream.
We are delighted with our success and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We are happy to travel to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
For us, everything is going very well.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the bloom of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We are good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s great when movement grows out of a group of friends, and that’s unusual.
From time to time, one group appears from one city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we’re happy to be friends with all of them and it’s an honor to be part of the sound of Seattle that has turned out.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same band for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than there are many bands.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we take care of others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, musical pathways have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music, and it couldn’t have been better.
Your attitude to the word glory was not easy; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We take care not to be too long on tour because it’s easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it did without deciding to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were in the band for almost three years and did not release any albums until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were a lot of disappointments because it took so long, and the most important thing is that we are still close friends with Bruce (Fervesser) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think of the incredible person who was Andy, and he was behind me.
He was a wonderful man and we miss him.
The local group Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you are familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the producers sent us some video offers and it was the band we liked the most, so we’re looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very exciting.
Why do you constantly change the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind are Geiser Butler, John Entvisl, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of bands that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came along at the same time, and if it’s important now, I think it’s great because it’s music that’s worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making music now better than ever before.
At first your music was darker, but now it has become more positive.
How would you explain this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they can sound a little positive.
From both of them when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think when you’re growing up and there’s been some kind of trauma in your life and you’ve lost a family member or friend, these events begin to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a state hospital on Tuesday to be examined for muscle loss in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is under observation.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told NTV that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that in his opinion, Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of mercy for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He underwent four surgeries for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, to which were added other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by an army extermination squad that acted in secret during the first years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive in Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the most important point of a comprehensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the leadership of Uruguay.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "favorable for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations", as the leadership of the South American country published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking support for Calderón for Uruguay in the incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that sparked Uruguay’s protest and a withdrawal for consultations with his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group formed by the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements to leave this “gray list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of countries that do not enjoy international standards of tax cooperation.
As far as the trade plan is concerned, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
Utilized plumber will become three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Pic from the evil paws of Bowie, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The release, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
“Mario is a hero who has to tell how stereoscopy will work without glasses,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvares, head of Nintendo’s Spanish press service, during a game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said Super Mario 3D Land was "the first Nintendo video game specifically designed for this platform" because hitherto successful products such as Star Fox 64 3D or Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D were adaptations of existing games.
A representative of Nintendo said that despite its existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go “in the second round” to the levels of the game, which this time are more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "do not succumb to optical illusions."
This three-dimensional Super Mario invasion also marks the hero’s return to the portable console, which hasn’t happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, a plumber with a moustache must pass through dangerous mined platforms in order to release Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "playing" Luigi.
Colum guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colón said on Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo had begun to hold him accountable in the United States for a $70 million laundering conspiracy.
This concludes the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which demanded the extradition of Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Kolom said his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and executive authorities, taking into account that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he had not "applied his hands" to legal decisions and had taken all extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Portillo, along with Sergio Ruano Marroquín, will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for selling drugs.
What Colum has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted in order to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (Court), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of spending Q120 million at the Department of Defense during the presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Department of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the social support organization Trinijove are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social isolation have helped overcome difficult situations during this quarter of a century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the results of the ceremony, held in the premises of the old factory Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born next to the Villa Trinitate in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or subject to marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu gathered a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
The different political representation during the elections showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Following Generalitat President Arthur Mass and his predecessor Hordi Puhol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education Consultant Ernest Maragall, and former mayoral lieutenant and current Ecosocialist, a member of the municipal council, Richard Gom.
Fabra I Coats’ current Social Welfare and Family Consultant, Josep Lewis Cleris and La Caixa’s Social Work CEO, Home Lanaspa, also appeared.
He said Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far “is a good basis.”
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of combating bad circumstances and giving hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and work done for it,” he said.
The seized building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on 51 Balmes Street.
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in the house 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people yesterday at noon voluntarily left the building they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated neighbors, according to a court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From now on, there will be pass control here,” the manager said.
The squatters who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest settled, seized all of the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a platform for mass parties, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building dragged her into an unfair competition as they sold drinks for three euros, while in the club for 10.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to complaints of neighbors about the noise, although, as she noticed, the noise was caused not by the visitors of the club, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as they said angry.
The owner of the club said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now, he "forgives" her the payment of the rent.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, advisor Alberto Fernand Díaz, called last week for an "immediate evacuation of the building to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have arisen in neighbors and degradation in this area."
The popular leader explained that until the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months squatters have invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them have been hacked.
In this sense, he added that “we must put an end to impunity and stand firm against the culturelessness that is taking place in the building.”
So yesterday, the police evacuated the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police headed to 35 Montreal Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four of them were arrested immediately.
A park or a forest?
Architects agree with the possibility of competition after disputes about contributions
The municipal competition for 16 doors resumed the debate about the role of the Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now extinct Capital Corporation of Barcelona (CSB), this administration printed promotional leaflets for the Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona’s capital city.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park once again took its place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is not oriented north-south, but up (mountain) down (sea).
The positioning of Colserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as the Yogi Bear.
That was until, in September, the council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Colserol.
The idea of the park is understood by the gate, of course.
Either so, or someone wants to put the gate in the field.
The question is one: Collserola? Park or mountain?
The competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic of discussion for all Barcelona architects.
This is hardly the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this clan of elected people meet each other in an elevator.
And this fact leads precisely to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present say.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain", when the proposal of Ildefonso Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
“The biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
Colserola is more complex,” says the architect, for whom the title “Colserola Gate” contains a “verbal trap”: we should not think of them “as entering the park, but as restricting some areas where we should act.”
Modlo, like Roldan and Bayon with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an “intellectual task” with “some dangers.”
Risks arising due to the “uncertainty of public space forecasting” after the experience of the 1980s, which ended on the Forum’s site with “your swan song”.
The first fear is actually the limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
“Limiting something is preparing for the next step,” it means transitioning.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [as far as the General Capital Plan (GSP) is concerned] can lead to real trouble.”
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than" as a purely topographical issue.
Módolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calserola, which “is not to be missed”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that the town hall offers to his profession, to join this project “from the beginning”.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should lead the interdisciplinary teams ("success", he argues), which should have created: "Architects should be able to create".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that asks the name of this part is complex, since the rules of the contest lack a general view of the Colserola: "There have been announced 16 crossing contests, - he says - in the sense of sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading here how to see and understand the region".
This makes it necessary, at least in his case, to decide to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for one gate can intersect with the program and definition of an architect's project for a neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the council should ensure that the strip directly above the Rhonda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabala and he will be released
After 72 days of settlements, Red Casino’s court representative pardoned Mayor Monterrey’s brother in the trial against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after a legal representative of Red Casino granted him an apology before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting an extortion lawsuit against the brother of Mayor Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garcia published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution so that the Monterrey authorities would allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
After a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on September 2, he was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He remained there for 49 days, following the provisions of the second order banning travel after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadet for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of the Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours there with the average degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his detention at the municipal prison in San Nicholas, Garza.
On October 25, the arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after nearly two months of investigations, enough obvious evidence of Jonas’ guilt, such as taking 1.5 million pesos from representatives of bookmakers in exchange for permission to operate.
On Monday, Red Casino’s legal representative, Victor Aldo García Gomez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for pardon for the mayor’s brother, so he could be released in the next hours.
During the trial, the state prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomes if he had made up for the damages and who of the casino’s partners was pardoning, although the lawyer tried not to make the name known.
Based on record 197/2011, Jonas Larrasabala was granted a lawful pardon, and thereafter no claims could be made regarding the trial that had been planned against him; no damages and punishment would be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, almost at 15:50, it was ordered to immediately release Larrasabala Breton.
The court clerk, Jorge Janez, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Pérez Hacome talks about the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MTT) said the results obtained in the accident, in which Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, showed that the helicopter hit directly on the ground in a state of complete integrity, without the pilot's attempts to make an impact.
During a press conference, Dionisio Peres Hacome, the Minister of Transport and Communications, said that before the aircraft climbed up, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
“The elements that seem to indicate that the ship had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with trees at 25 meters, where the means lost the whistle.”
He also reported that the ship was intended for 19 people, respectively, it met the necessary requirements for the transport of people.
He also said that studies conducted in the impact area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study reports that there are no components of the ship elsewhere, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the transport of passengers.
The earth in this place has a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
By now, the secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, CEO of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that during the strike, the presidential helicopter was operated at cruising speed and that it happened on a soft rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual summer maneuver at the time of the strike," he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner Perez Hakome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the team should have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable conditions for takeoff when the aircraft headed for the border territory between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, where cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloudy conditions, the team was looking for a zone of less height and greater visibility in the Cuernavaca Valley.
Place of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording from the aircraft radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or a change of direction of flight.
Dispersion of debris on a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the strike hit the front and side lines.
The scattering of debris makes it clear that the helicopter collided with the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion.
In the area of the disaster remains unfounded evidence in the debris of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent research suggests that there may have been multiple contacts with the earth.
During work on the site, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the land has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful research on a larger area than the area outlined near the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the strike occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS Announces Obesity Gene Search Program
Social Protection Leads Study to Find Obesity Gene in Children and Young People; Supported by IPN Experts
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which is called the protocol "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescent" that will provide counting of signs associated with overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the National Medical Center’s 21st Century Specialized Hospital, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietitians and social workers had gathered.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (prescribed or not) is invited to take part, going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children will be conducted every Saturday, from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol was started at the sports center in Quautemoque (in the west of Mexico City), and since October 8 the events are held at the sports center in Nesaualcoyotle (east of Mexico City).
Once the goal of attracting between 500 and 600 children is reached, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (North Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study is to understand the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On November 14, World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main goal is to gather 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with the permission of parents and under their supervision to fill in individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and a history of familial hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) will be conducted.
Cruz López said that the study reflects the concerns of health professionals about the worrying weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there was an increase in just 6 years: in the case of boys, 77 percent were obese, in the case of girls, 47 percent; in terms of excess weight, there was also a significant increase," said MSSI specialist.
He said that the validity of the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, the Mexican is 65 percent offspring of American Indians, 30 percent offspring of Europeans, and five percent offspring of Africans, and this condition affected the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the genetics of obesity are mainly due to the body’s inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories), and it is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit for participants is a comprehensive assessment of children, which can reveal whether they have any degree of excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (acants) and forearms means the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is handled with all confidentiality, the doctors pass it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes that need to be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the TV, and using transport at short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to the high calorie intake, that is, the increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
UNAM asphalt will be able to avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM chemical faculty, has developed polymer-modified bitumen to produce a blend of the best quality, environmentally and temperature resistant.
If the signals sent by the road cover were paid attention, then it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the metropolitan area in the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Herrera Naher, a researcher at the chemical faculty of UNAM, and adds that if the process of construction and maintenance is insufficient.
In his lecture, The Technological View of the Pit, read within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and hence counteract the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of the oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of which have a high molecular mass, called asphaltites, and others have a low molecular mass, called maltenes, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscosity.
The viscous behavior of bitumen is the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it maintains an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes crumbly.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but varies throughout the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, a specialist in chemical engineering said.
The scientist noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which consists of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the topmost layers is the bitumen, composed of small stones dropped into the bitumen and then squeezed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is submerged in bitumen.
When driving vehicles and exerting effort, this helps forces to distribute very well on the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be distributed even better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt coating, he added, is placed the last layer, which is called a layer of wear, which is made of fine stone, in fact sand also immersed in the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the transport wheels, it should have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
Being part of the road covering that will receive and disseminate these efforts, the layer of wear also requires proper thickness, and it is necessary to take into account the material from which it is made.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the condition of the asphalt.
When the soil is raw, the water penetrates the coating and it is difficult to get out of it, this causes the softening of all layers of the coating and, therefore, the formation of pits.
When pits are formed, he said, the first layer of wear is worn and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur instantly, this is a process that should be paid attention at the first signs of ongoing repair programs.
A member of the National Research System explained that transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating should always be associated with transport load and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met to prevent frequent occurrence of holes.
Rafael Herrera said that much still needs to be studied and done about bitumen, for example, bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help to repair pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What was the candidate from Valle lacking to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from receiving the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle has won the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca only wanted to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Cerna was supposed to be content with getting on the winners' podium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new Princess of Colombia.
With regard to the result achieved last night (1990) by Alreda (1990) in Cartagena (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda), Alreda (198), Alreda), Alreda (197), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda (198), Alreda), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda, Alreda (19), Alreda, Alreda, Alreda (19), Alreda, Alreda, Alreda (19), Alreda), Alreda, Alreda (19), Alre, Alre, Alreda, Alreda (19), Alre, Alre, Alreda (19), Alreda, Alreda (19), Alreda (19), Ale), Alreda (19), Ale), Ale), Ale), Al
A question that many are now asking:
What was lacking? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each of the performances demonstrated that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just so she was chosen by the Queen's Police and the Most Beautiful Face by the version of the Vogue - titles that were owned by the Queen.
The first factor that played a role in the jury’s decision to award her the title of the First Princess was that she was unable to convincingly answer the question “What book characterizes you and why?” posed by Martin Muriel Gomez of the Literary Society Let’s Read.
She replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of occultation, and I definitely believe that the book that characterizes my childhood – Little Prince – is a pretty deep book.
Today I am reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature, which we should all read; also at the moment I am reading the book of Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Blood Heat".
An answer that the jury did not like because of the term “cultivation” and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the books cited characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and satisfied with her result: “universal wisdom, what is going to happen.”
And you all, please read at least a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the voiced hypotheses, Vallee burned out of favoritism.
A reporter from Bogota suggested that, because she was preferred, she was met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Ostera's culinary competition, the spectator vote for the best national costume, and the Queen-Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of other candidates.
And this was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit at Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter on RCN’s “How to Home” program, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess “means that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest does not become a queen.”
In addition, the representative of Valle has recently avoided contact with the press and this was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Dottie said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
“One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we have to look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness before they take part in the competition, they already have to be involved in the projects,” she said.
There is also a suggestion that Valle's representative sinned with buttock defects and fibrosis, which was seen on her belly, but this is controversial, as the jury specifically noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Kings consultant Jorge Hernán Orosco notes that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but the problems of fibrosis on the abdomen, which for me were not very noticeable, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she underwent surgical intervention.
“The operations are good, but the representative of Valle does not know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the cruel prediction came true last night, they say it was the decoy that Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for her loss of the pleasure of getting the crown.
Whether it is or not, the fact is that today Melina begins the year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions directly indicated by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the competition in Cartagena, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A forensic scientist from Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI forensic scientist Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven forensic investigators working at the CTI, this week it was the turn of Eliza Gonzalez, a Puerto-Texas man who spent 21 years in the field of prosecution.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to dig through the jungle for more than five days to reach the places where the bodies needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in forensic science, where he studied friction of the skin, i.e. palms and stones.
During the week of Elizar's operation to identify a man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something big was coming up.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmyra.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them supposedly belonged to the man who led the world’s oldest partisan war, so they asked him to take ten photographs of the prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the location where the body was, he did not recognize it in its outward appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed as a local farmer, without glasses, and considerably thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using a magnifying glass, ink, shovel, and torch, Elizar compared the body’s fingerprints to those in the photographs.
His eyes did not fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Texas was asked to confirm to the Secretary of Defense Juan Carlos Pinson that it was the head of the RWSK
Finding fingerprints
The acknowledgment received by President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González at a press conference on the operation against Kano is particularly significant for the specialist in the field of fingerprinting Sijin from Kali.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprinting specialists are involved in investigating crimes such as theft and murder and identifying the detainees.
In detention, many criminals have fake IDs or do not have documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in case of theft he had to take a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief leaned his hands to seize a safe, full of jewelry and money.
“It’s hard to work with walls because they’re not comfortable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire palm of your hand and establish the identity of the criminal who took part in several thefts,” he says.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles of liquor around him.
In the course of the investigation, it was established that a relative could have been suspected of committing the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A fingerprint specialist from the CTI explained that where there are fingerprints, a chemical or physical reagent is applied.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or entered into the registry.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves a mark on it.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
"Angry People" Challenges New York City's Authorities
Hundreds of protesters camped in front of Zuckotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park in the neighborhood.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square under the protection of a court order, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered near Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get to thanks to a court order that allowed "angry people" to break the camp on the square, while another part of the movement responded to the rush, seizing a park north of the city, where further arrests were carried out.
“Our idea is that once the court does not allow us to break the camp on the square, we will break the camp somewhere else and continue the legal struggle for the return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations,” said one of the representatives of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of "angry people" to the evacuation of the tent town, which was personally ordered by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting the forcible evacuation from the square.
In addition, the "angry people" have begun to seize the new park, located at the junction of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish church.
At least an hour they could have taken the place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not name the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization claims that several hundred people stood with tents at the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support to members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zukotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, which will examine the legality of this morning's dispersal of protesters.
Some of the protesters heading there carried and distributed copies of that court order at the same time and even gave those copies to the police guarding the square, leading to "some small clashes," said Bray, who said some police beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of the “Occupy Wall Street” movement and forcing “laws that were issued after the beginning of the seizure, or forbidding demonstrators to re-enter the park with stores and other previously used property.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that due to this court ruling, the city suspended the opening of public space and the protesters were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to reopen tent shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was made because the protesters “violated the law.”
Bloomberg said he ordered the area to be cleaned as it became "a place where people came not to protest but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm other people" as "some businesses received threats" and neighbors feared "deterioration of the quality of life".
The evacuation, which took place this morning, was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers," a spokesman for the movement said, denouncing the mayor's "disrespect for freedom of speech."
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they plan to organize "grandiose actions" on Thursday in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the television program "Christmas by Russell Peters" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "Big Repair", a lifeguard in "Rescuers of Malibu", Bunny in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show on Kabaddi.
The private CTV channel announced today that Anderson, along with crowner Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the December 1st television show "The Birth of Russell Peters", in the role of a very special Mary.
CTV today unveiled the footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for a popular home pornographic video on the Internet, where she appears with her then-husband, the drummer of the band "Mötley Crüe" Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding her face in a manger.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent, who recently starred as the lead on the tour "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheen, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, in a special Christmas show CTV participates Canadian singer Buble, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires to Argentine model Luisiana Lopilato and who also knows the meaning of scandals.
Buble recently called American Kim Kardashian a “slut” during one of her concerts in New York City.
Japan Reborn After the Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and put an end to the downturn that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that entailed the nuclear crisis, the most terrible catastrophe endured by the Rising Sun Country since World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo government, the material losses amounted to $300,000 million - a blow that, despite the difficult global situation, seems to be taking place.
After three consecutive losing quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped to turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% year-on-year.
Registered in the second quarter, for the Japanese the fiscal year begins in March 2012, also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The revival may be partly due to the revival of the purchase of machinery to rebuild areas devastated by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% against a 0.9% decrease in capital costs, which was seen from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for using the crisis to strengthen – or restructure – infrastructure using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up, mainly due to the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure has increased by 1% due to increased costs for cars, travel and recreation.
Yankee stamp
Tokyo provided the domestic market when the Japanese yen became one of the “refugee currencies” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the eurozone debt crisis and negative U.S. forecasts, a privilege that pushes, like a stone, into the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow for a country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its lows from July to September.
As markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Noda government is not decreasing vigilance.
We must be wary of continuing risks such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the sharp increase in the value of the yen, Minister of Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most member countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
An indicator that predicts breakthroughs in the global economy has shown that the main forces are slowing.
Then it fell four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the average, which is at 100 points, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is once again giving grounds for doubt.
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written commitments.
With peripheral premiums for risk and uncertainty reigning in the parks, Greece continues to roam the labyrinth leading to its exit from the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "agreement" of the new transitional government of the Hellas is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lukas Papadimos yesterday warned that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment may not be sufficient for their application, the leader of the conservative party "New Democracy" Antonis Samaras assures that he will not support the new measures.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions adopted at the October 26 summit, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will be crowned tomorrow by a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear any doubts about his position: “We are ready to help the transitional government, but we promise nothing.”
The Conservative leader has made one step more in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, organizations that must defrost the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of consent to the treaty requirements.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect caused by Papandreou’s all-or-nothing referendum allegations, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unambiguous: it will not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties of Greece can sign a written agreement without any hesitation.
Ministry of Economy spokesman Amadeu Altafay said the three inspectors could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what needs to be done to pay the sixth instalment" of $8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been set.
In the Greek club there will be enough threads for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen underlined Spain’s “main” position regarding this type of finance
“Spain has taken a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance.”
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades the country has become the second largest donor in terms of instruments of cooperation, whose “essentiality”, she said, is that it is “an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on faith in people”.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such actions are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and that "the United Nations is committed to reducing the amounts of micro-credit in the United Nations by 2015.
Spain "still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with all "responsibility", says Dona Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements that emerged during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "provide the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the most disadvantaged people".
There are “many achievements” and “many difficulties that we face.”
The microcredit summit is becoming not only a platform for controversy, but also a platform that promotes “two main goals.”
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and 100 million of these households will be lifted out of the poverty into which they are immersed.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and around the world “has followed the path started years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Sofia, as an “act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of the instrument as a "surprising idealist in the general case of poverty reduction", whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy on the spot.
This experience took over the first World Summit in Washington a year later and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "everywhere I have seen continuous development", said Her Majesty, whose connection with this project has been given the title of "Yesterday".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said that solidarity is an "ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez concluded that microcredit implies a "serious and firm course towards poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" developed country governments should work according to solidarity criteria and not allow it to become a victim of spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main directions of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised the "success" in giving "confidence" to the people "to whom all doors are closed", and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, who "welcomed the city, greeted all those present.
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig took place without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but emerged in the autumn itself, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that the government’s policy is far from as strict as it should be, today towards Greece and perhaps tomorrow towards Italy.
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, put forward for discussion by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovations, lasting several minutes, which merited Angela Merkel’s speeches and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, Europhile and Finance Minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
For the chancellor, “it’s time for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty, making it possible for the European Union to tighten control over the financial policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a universal vote, "to give Europe a face".
In any case, this is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; Britain is against it, and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is against it, too.
But the ground is ready.
Similarly, by an overwhelming majority, the delegates rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member state on the European Central Bank’s board according to the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Desiring to calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in a difficult position that like to criticize "high" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes an entire paragraph to the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just by-pass.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What Is Hospital Letter Fraud?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the government began an offensive on hospital bills.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family benefit distribution fund and make a speech on this issue, which has been periodically raised since 2007, on combating social benefit fraud.
And to help this offensive, which arose from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing presidential re-election campaign, the majority wants to focus on hospital bills.
First of all, in view of budget savings, the government intends to impose on employees of private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of the allowance.
Apparently, without the specific consent of the employer, the sick worker will lose a four-day salary equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to generate a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will result in savings of 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose on public servants one day without payment of sickness allowance (public servants have not yet had to wait for the payment of the allowance, unlike the three-day expectation of private sector workers).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority is also re-evaluating the issue of fraud, referring to abuse when issuing hospital letters.
The controls will be tougher, and if you are caught, you will have to return all payments you have illegally received," Bertrand warned on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital records.
They have indeed been subjected to constant scrutiny and political attacks since 2002, which are bearing fruit.
People in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s take a look at the country’s figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensation costs of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion in 2008 accounted for 5% of total health spending.
Of this amount, 46 per cent relate to maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, which amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
And, therefore, made up 2.5% of health-related expenses.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic that hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com found that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day of hospital.
Another study, this time on health insurance, claims that in 2010, 37% of hospitals lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
If you compare these figures with the numbers of European neighbors, you can see that French workers are not more likely to take a hospital than the workers of any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the overall proportion of absenteeism in France (for health reasons or not) ranged from 10% to 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital records is very low compared to the "gray" employment.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 led to a systematic check-up of hospitals lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease findings were “unwarranted” or too long,” or 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically inspected hospital records lasting more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", which is 132,000.
Overall, it turns out that 169,000 cases were "unfounded" on several million workers who received hospital letters.
Figures that show very few cases compared, for example, to the "gray" employment figures.
According to UMP deputy Dominic Tiana, the author of the report on the issue in June, they amount to between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 million in unrecognized budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore is infinitely higher than the losses from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos said on Monday in parliament, adding that 100 days given to his coalition government were not enough to accomplish this task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budget adjustment,” said the head of government, who made his first public statement, opening a discussion on a vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
Implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's presence in the eurozone is "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos forecasts a reduction in the country’s budget deficit “approximately to 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right side rejects the new government.
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the challenges of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also with his rejection of any course that hinders the recovery of the economy.
Olli Renu, the European Commissioner responsible for economics and finances, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance, says a committee of experts
Canadians refused to die, says report from Royal Society of Canada
Regarding palliative medicine, the committee argues that the government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, not to mention cases of cancer.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada involving six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee proposes that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow for suicide by foreign aid and euthanasia when circumstances impose such a choice and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, the experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Experts Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Due to medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in a hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization involves abuse in use, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide with outside assistance against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference that the majority of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with outside assistance is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid, they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older people or disabled people are of lesser value.
As for people who assisted in suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
Regarding the extension or cessation of medical care for the patient, the situation is less unambiguous, say the authors of the report.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that legally lawful cessation of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the refusal of end-of-life care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best palliative care possible, not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be used when it is not used to alleviate physical pain, such as euthanasia, and has been subjected to the same restrictions.
Comments from other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metro Pierre Deshan, a specialist in health legislation, described the position of the experts who signed the report as “extreme” because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to fatalities.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says Meter Deshan, who discussed the report’s summary yesterday.
Metro Desham also emphasized that the authors of the report seem to place individual independence above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that “there are warning signs and prohibitions in society.”
Margaret Somerville, a health law expert, also expressed “a categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called a “manifesto for euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report’s data on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President Assad to surrender power
Damascus condemns 'conspiracy'
Syria Is Increasingly Isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was heightened by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists him and condemns the "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria’s neighbors Turkey and Jordan advocated the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to cede power in Syria, where about 40 civilians and armed forces were killed.
“If the interests of his country were dear to Bashar, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life,” the king of Jordan, a neighboring country to Syria, told the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey’s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot meet their aspirations will lose power, he said, hinting at Syria, a neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough course.
The United States, for its part, welcomes the "expansion of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly tough course towards repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the regime’s armed forces were killed in the Deraa area in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) reports.
Two other residents were killed in the shooting and heavy machine gun shooting in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country is approaching the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this conspiracy against Syria will fail.
After its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently examining “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the inclusion in the country of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also called for sending observers from the UN to help protect civilians from repression by the regime, which he said fell into “paranoia.”
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, among other things, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where fighting is taking place, and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "wrong" yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement a plan to exit the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.

Monty demands time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and execute a program that will require "sacrifices" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner took part yesterday in a discussion with political parties ahead of today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet, composed of technocrats who are not members of parliament.
Monty spoke about the importance of the programme, which involves many victims, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting with the candidate for prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote on confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will conclude with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of state, Georgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
“Democracy requires time to prepare the government and the program, he stressed, adding that he is convinced that markets will be patient and understanding.”
His appointment by the president was initially approved by the markets, but concerns resurfaced, particularly after the sudden fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians.”
The new government should be in place until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence from parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti has ensured that when he takes office, he will work hard to ensure that Italy will once again become an important player in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed.
The European Union, convinced that Rome will not implement the planned budget for 2013, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, has called for, among other things, new austerity measures.
The Italian boss, Emma Marchegalia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth can’t meet the deficit parameters.”
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconianism", a "professor" symbolizing the "challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the authors of the vanguards.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid early elections, as by April 2012 Italy must make payments on public debt in the amount of 200 billion euros.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, the U.S. nuclear safety agency confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “from the sixties, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds explosive methods.”
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to create a company that produces "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact with the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, until his return to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentions “explicit signs that Iran’s development of a “nuclear detonator system” was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well, but who also told the agency that he worked most of his career on this technology as part of a military nuclear program.”
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50% between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or remained unchanged over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, equivalent to an increase of 49%, compared to an increase of 13% in cases of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% in attacks on Jews and a total increase of 14% in the number of crimes on religious grounds.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After the decline in 2009, it is worrying that the number of these crimes is growing again, Human Rights First stresses, “increasing cases of violence against Muslims is particularly significant,” the organization adds in an official statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be treated as serious violations of human rights,” added Paul Legendre, the organization’s executive director.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reporting of hate crimes.”
"Hate crimes" in federal law is a legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, nationality, and today’s sexual orientation.
Twitter Is Changing Its Platform and Becoming Like Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to the presentation of its platform that will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, which makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "name" allows you to more easily and directly follow the activity of other "twitters", Internet users whose messages ("tweets") you follow, and those who follow yours.
This makes it possible to find out if they will post messages, if they will sign up for new accounts, if they will have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “on a low percentage of users in August” before coming to widespread use across the network on Monday, AFP’s Caroline Penner, a Twitter spokeswoman, said.
Twitter, which has long been known to be intuitively rather incomprehensible and to use rather vague terms (RT for reposting someone else’s message, #followfriday for a recommendation to track other users), is mostly not bringing pleasure to experienced users, and is thus opening itself up to more experienced users.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of "tweets" on the Internet.
“It’s useless, obsessive and overly reminiscent of Facebook.”
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed, <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
Austro-Hungarian
Introduction of the "golden rule" of the budget in the constitution
The leadership of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to inscribe the budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution, in order to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of the state credit rating agencies.
Chancellor Social Democrat Werner Faymann personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian government debt amounting to 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of the norm of 60% established by the Treaty of Maastricht, but lower than the government debt of such countries, Istalia, or Istalia.
If Austria’s solvency had fallen by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by three thousand million euros more each year, said Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister of the Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Austria has thus met the demand of the Eurozone member countries’ summit on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of state and government have demanded budget deficit reductions by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian government is reminiscent of the "German model" because Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
By 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and since 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the lands, as well as the municipalities, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to make the government debt fall below the 60% mark set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Ishihiko Noda
Threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yesihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the value of the yen continues to rise.
We intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the yen's exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose almost to a historic mark that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which set a new strength record since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, adapted to the purchases of investors who perceive it as a “refugee” in these turbulent times of global economic downturn and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is damaging Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the amount of income of Japanese firms from abroad when converting to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to recover" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda said, fearing that this yen rise would kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The third largest economic power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the growth of exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan’s “fundamental economic performance.”
Finance Minister Jun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But deputy managing director Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps” and made it clear that no further easing should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47 billion euros) the purchase of treasury bonds, raising to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts it allocates to the purchase of various financial instruments to saturate the stock market.
Eurozone
rates are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of contagion by the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left this Tuesday, November 15, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished bidding at 3.064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt fell to 0.4% and London to 0.1%.
Due to new difficulties in repaying loans by euro area countries in a difficult situation, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Worrisome investors are just too worried about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7% under the weight of new market participants' doubts about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has set its sights on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the future of the eurozone is beating the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after the congress of Chancellor Angela Merkel CDU party on Monday, which adopted a resolution that provides, in particular, the possibility for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone, without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6%
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield of Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the stock exchange to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened by paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the "core task" of his government.
Spain was under fire from the markets ahead of parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between Germany and Spain’s 10-year debt rates has reached a new historical high.
Expecting growth in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, due to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, looked back at the second-quarter decline, with a 0.1% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy Policies:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be made after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings become a reason to reflect on the fate and place of nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
France must build its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
Now we have 7 billion people on the planet, demographic development will entail doubling the need for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to compensate for the growing scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
It is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its set, resuming the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on Three Mile Island.
Although the model of Germany based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, aggravated by the increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the rise in carbon dioxide emissions in connection with the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
Consider the example of Denmark.
The European champion for the construction of turbines, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to intermittent wind; which is why carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher, respectively, than the average in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of servicing industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of the purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the energy policy of the country has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect ones.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole plethora of internationally traded small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be relocated to another industry.
If France decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a lot of these enterprises and lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion a year from France’s exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What kind of electrical engineer will order an EPR designed to work for sixty years if it is planned to close its manufacturer?
To solve the equation of energy, it must be admitted that there are no divine or devilish sources of energy production.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue for nuclear energy.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent control of existing energy centers, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
Over the past 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any consequences for humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it has learned from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, represents a project to counter these phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy specialists who want to build the reactor, stopping its construction in Flamandville will be a great gift to competitors Areva and EDF, paving the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to take the lead in the dispute, which is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a benefit to the economy?
Immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized by various sides – the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinate to the policy of numbers and the compatibility of this policy with France’s self-proclaimed status as a “human rights state”.
Then there was administrative harassment of foreign students, which got into the news release when the Minister of the Interior (“Liberation” of May 23) said that France “does not need foreign talents, stonemasonry and waiters.”
But it is very rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left agree on this.
On the right side was Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 stated that "900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left side was Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor from all over the world".
The only difference is the level of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of an invasion of the territory of the country horde of Polish plumbers felt both left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity that they will allow to be shown to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confined himself to trivialities, saying that “joint work will solve our immigration problem.”
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but economically it is very expensive.
As we are reminded by economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron in a recent book, summarizing the latest data on immigration (Special people: How migration has shaped our world and will determine our future, May 2011, publishing house of Princeton University, 352 p.), among specialists there is a wide range of influences on immigration.
Immigration restrictions have weakened growth and reduced employment.
Fears of immigrant influence are based on the notion that they are capable of replacing local workers, especially low-skilled workers, provoking wage cuts.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants do much more than replace the local workforce by doing jobs that lack the local workforce.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local workforce, and the most skilled ones work in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between locals and immigrants leads to the fact that the arrival of immigrants positively affects the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% of the migration flow leads to an increase of 0.6-0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among American Nobel laureates, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net profit in social security systems, giving an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to estimates of the World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring a net profit (income minus expenses) to the state budget for his life on average 150,000 euros.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy was going to cling to missing growth points with his teeth.
The said teeth, which were used to scare off immigrants, gave exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to make sense of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time it is fragile.
The European continent must remember that, inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century it survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some believed that for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it was enough to arrange a vote and make it as straight as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon the "Little" it is known that this comes from the surface of thinking.
A universal vote, while a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient prerequisite and may even become a “instrument of suppression,” as the once-republican philosopher Etienne Washro said.
No, democracy requires much more – public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have a double revealing effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality must be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, in the opinion of many, the Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We won’t win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and chaotic.
A "carte blanche" for an absolute European monarch or a leap with your legs tied into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of a guillotine blade, but of the implementation - joint, clear and continuous - of choice and democracy, this time at a pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgently necessary to restore the management of the European project under the sovereignty of the people.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce everyone’s debt burden, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
To get out of the crisis will require decisions at a pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's do it.
But imagining it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come to life is another insanity and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build a Europe that is economically united.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people’s sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more and more.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with an 11% growth in global microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM-card phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 billion units.
The most important sector of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases by simply passing a map over the reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold in the world compared to 320 million a year ago!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected to be 580 million units) and will make up almost 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the field of contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are in circulation.
But big stores are gaining momentum.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes.
To move to higher speeds, banks need to equip their customers with equipment.
“Two major organisations in France have promised to systematically distribute to their customers in the future bank cards adapted for contactless use,” said Gerard Nebuy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future means of payment, i.e. the mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is necessary for such transactions.
“They were postponed.
"But they really have to fly away next year."
“We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
Banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment in Cana from December to June next year.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and employees will be equipped with cases that provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch an offer that allows its customers to pay via mobile phones.
Terrorist Front Spreads from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links of the Islamic Maghreb with the Boko Haram sect.
The long-established links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messachel even said that the Algerians are now confident.
“The way these two organizations are using and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he said, without going into details.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January revealed two linkages.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocourt and Vincent Delori, apparently were killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
The Axis of Terror
The analysis of the calls pointed to several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other points to a person allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we certainly have to wait for more reliable evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the cult receives financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type used by Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems created by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of enlightened people who are not of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at a mosque, a school, and under the imam-fundamentalist Mohamed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is a sin" on the house - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict adherence to Sharia law, and its activists have begun the fight against the wicked central government.
It is mainly targeted at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blockaded the city and left 800 dead.
Mohamed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and will go beyond its northern wings.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another one in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on a fortified police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, now worries all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Presidents Goodluck, Jonathan Allen Juppé warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed readiness to share all available information.
The world as seen by Republican presidential candidates
With regard to China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and incompetence.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, or more precisely, simplistic ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the loud but detailless statements on foreign policy that have traditionally been the strong side of Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel are often confused with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being promoted from the “Old Good Party”, threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency is a sensitive topic for America, annoyed by the migration of entire industries to Asia.”
Even worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate who knows complex foreign policy, has not been able to overcome a position that encourages emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who remains at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am chosen, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll have a bomb.”
He also pledged to step up military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to deliver on his promises to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, second in the ranking of candidates, demonstrated discouraging ignorance of the cases.
He recently called for confronting the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power – obviously not knowing that China has possessed it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
Recourse to torture of suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to lower his tone in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the “boys” from Iraq, on his tricks in Libya that brought him the reputation of a weak politician.
But the offensive is not so easy.
The population considers a positive balance of national security under Obama, who eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that tie in the sand.
And, claiming that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
The North Stream, a new gateway for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North Stream pipeline, connecting Western Europe and Russia directly on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the performance of the orchestra and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Marthe Rutte together turned the symbolic valve controlling the Russian gas inflow into the Western European network.
According to the new pipeline, an additional 27.500 million cubic meters of gas will flow to Western Europe each year on the first pipeline of 1,224 km long, connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline is expected to be ready at the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas equivalent to all of France’s consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it harder to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the heaviest moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop to compare the North Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has managed in less than five years to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
“This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it’s a new artery that organically connects us,” said François Fillon, opening the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Ljubljana, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel locked in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to circumvent the minefields that remained from World War II.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
There was also a need to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake with a weight equal to the weight of 242 Eiffel Towers, without gaps along its entire length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers rejected it because Sweden was not thrilled that the Russian state-owned company would forever settle off its shores.
“In the event of an accident, we will shut down the flow of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
So, in case of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will leak into the air.
But this seems unlikely to designers who designed seams designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
The control of the gas pipeline will be carried out by a submarine robot pulling the ship for external monitoring, as well as an apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
The cigar-shaped apparatus is inserted into the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and pushed forward by a flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second it gives accurate information about any metal deformation.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
The circulation of gas is carried out only at the expense of its pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital, remains the leader.
The rest are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate the pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas is actually being transported,” says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for two pipelines.
GDF Suez’s investment will be around $240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay for their costs, because Gazprom assumes all the risks.
The pipeline leaves the Baltic Sea in Ljubljana on a sandy shore planted with coniferous trees.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the output terminal of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine brand notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will return the taste to the letter.
It has the scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
Moleskine notebook is easy to recognize on a rectangular black cover, on rubber, on yellowish-white pages, as if yellowed with time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, has decided to launch design notebooks for sale.
Maria Sebregondi, the company’s consultant at the time, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique, moleskine - lacquered cotton fabric, used, for example, to cover scamaees.
It is claimed that this type of notebook is highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought into line with today’s taste the old and forgotten thing that was cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the managing brand at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales grew by 25% and reached 12.7 million units.
We have gone far from the production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the profile of a typical buyer, because the notebook equally attracts a businessman, a student and a person of a free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centers of small towns and has been able to gain widespread fame.
“We have followed the spirit of time and this new need for letters, despite the emergence of email,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature accompanies Moleskine's development; the brand recently organized an exhibition called "The Surrounding Road", where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard drawing on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Using its successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
A success that gave rise to envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which has entered a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of disability employment begins today.
Despite the public charity policy initiated in 2005, unemployment among the disabled is still twice as high as the average, 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the general population.
Disappointing?
“No,” says Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for people with disabilities.
“In 15 years, significant progress has been made.”
“At that time, the unemployment rate was not two, but three times higher.”
“There is still a lot of work ahead.”
It must be said that there are still many barriers to employment for the disabled.
Among them, there are more elderly people: 37% over the age of 50 (17% on average).
They have a rather low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very prevalent, which is 85% for people with disabilities versus 38% on average.
In short, all of these are criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are the essence of the problem,” said Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur Association on behalf of Cité found that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and “represented ordinary people in strollers or mentally or mentally handicapped.”
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the target of having 6% of disabled workers set out in a law passed in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 give a value of 2.6%.
“Today we’re about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that don’t comply with the law.
Evidence: The number of "taxable" organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which raised the tax, put a lot of pressure on the company,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects an increase in awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with employees from 20 to 49 have disabled workers, compared to 82% of organizations with employees from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday evening (20:45 a.m.) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the stadium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after his striker left in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian."
“I want to go further,” Lille said.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the team, it is one whole.
"I'm in Lille all year round and I'm not in Belgium."
“I need to earn my glasses.”
Left in reserve, on the eve of this match against France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
Not to mention the concept of “pleasure”.
He has supported the Blues since the age of 7 and won campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always supported them,” he said.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this game.
And especially that on the other side are Mathieu (Debushi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami).
“Our roads have crossed.”
"Being able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered "pride."
"Proud" to play in a "holiday match."
“Pride” also claims as a “neighbor” that France “became a very high-level team again” just a year after the injury in Nayzna.
"Laurent Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly on the same plane with the Blues... to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll see to it in future matches, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident in itself.
Portugal’s Paulo Bento starts his rematch against Bosnia at 22:00 on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
“By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paul Bentu already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the national team, which he has been at the helm since September 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to be played and Bosnia has to be won.
Taking into account 0-0 on Friday in Hell Zenica it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the long-awaited goal that would calm her down.
“It’s a good result, but it carries a certain risk.”
But at home, at their brightly lit de la Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, which should be delighted, although the match will be very tense," - said optimistic, but judgmental Bento.
“We are expecting a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", said the successor of Carlos Keiros.
A match against Bosnia on Friday demands a victory from the Portuguese.
No one could have killed the Bosnians.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk," Bent said.
"We will play against a team with a lot of technical strengths and players with a lot of individual strengths," he added.
As was already the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning, "not to give them time to think."
It’s a good idea to make it realistic this time.
