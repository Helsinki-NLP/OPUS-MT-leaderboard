A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws from 2009 onwards making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon grew in scale after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the periods of voting in advance, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the election and remove citizens with a judicial file from their right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID card.
More than that.
Students, who are considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
Two out of three Hispanic voters are in favour of the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws that abolished voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have enacted laws in five other states to shorten the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state voters.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who made up 76% of voters, represented only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vehemently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undeniably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that the states that passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes needed by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes have erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes even more hesitant men already reluctant to pass screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that you are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if you are not detected.
So I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead opting, in those cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest that they do active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being determined with precision.
I recommend that you pass the test anyway.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked more, that rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very damaging to people’s health.
“Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to the CCS.
They would increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research demonstrates that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the researchers said.
Food (food)
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of getting colorectal cancer.
Butchers, too, and they should be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“These can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs Boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole emotion, last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "lesser" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet entirely certain that it is Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are holding an authentic new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely sure.
Let's assume it's Higgs anyway, since the chances of being wrong seem thin, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this low world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot end up in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Now, even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting grosso modo in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In a corner, there are good citizens named Fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would somehow appear.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not all as exotic beasts as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messaging" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "carrying force".
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for that boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond with only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like that of CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
Not all particles, nor all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, yours) do not.
Now, what "can" all this research bring, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancy between observations and predictions of MS.
In fact, there are many who are keen to find one, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physical" and clog some holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (hopefully!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-hopefully!).
But no such differences have been found at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research in the daily life of Mr and Mrs All-the-World are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such repercussions.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers at Bell Laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work was going to unleash.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - told us fire, at first the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget".
I can imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work on optics.
This sensor, although it was not its original intention at all, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and won it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that LHC activities will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... <0x7C> The Duty
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec has recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this essential area.
The Duty tried to take a closer look at it.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in La Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate that gnawed him had left him a two-year respite.
"They gave me five years to live, I've been seven years," he said, half-fig half-grape, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its job: an enormous weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Stuck in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even happens to smile, talks to strangers who deal with him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man urinates standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Regressing to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept regression,” he says.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the "team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “consciously and suffocated.”
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
"I don't have any wishes in life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
However, in the next few days, she expects a last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provide body care and nutrition assistance.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know we all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Upon death, we will agree to provide oral care to brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died overnight.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but do not resemble each other.
Alongside an old 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family gathering in the courtyard, well tucked into his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old young man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to relieve suffering when a patient reaches the end of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Society for Palliative Care at Home in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that causes several palliative care specialists to fear the adoption of a law that governs euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care summits including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients are only asking to die because they are not receiving proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are stalking their patients to the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helene Richard’s life expectancy was already low when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
Still, she told me I was done!
No All-Powerful Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank the caregivers for not having accessed their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society of Home Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which involves sleeping the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible by a journalism scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing the building industry, civil servants, politicians, unionists and mafiosos.
An " industry " that has cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been crumbling since we took the big shots," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into misconduct related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had only consented to backtrack.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, occult party funding and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved $1 billion on contracts," some refraining from their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "already dropped two mayors," he added, hoping it could "demonstrate the schemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More the police of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, would have led the Montreal "sewer cartel" to put the soft pedal on the puffs of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third largest city.
He is suspected of having pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formally accused are also road engineers from Montreal and contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years, he paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who returned the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito planted all kinds of seeds in the 2000s, donating more than $88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraising campaign for former deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts that he inflated costs
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked round and round.
Gilles Surprisant, a former public works engineer, has detailed this before the commission: in ten years, he has received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totaling $736,000, in exchange for wastewater contracts whose costs he inflates.
Other road officials confessed to having their leg greased by inflating the bills from 30 to 40 percent, through fake extras.
Then a mayoral party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first women to sound the alarm bell.
Mayor of the arrondissement of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rebels from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of Dirty Money in Election Campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that it "pulls on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the culprits."
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
The wound is being cleaned, but it would take a Montreal-owned investigative unit and a day before we see the dubious practices come back.
Like we're cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elects aware of the scheme", when they did not plunge into the trap!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in funding election campaigns in Quebec, he ironically: "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not change the situation, he said: "Until we strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "One cannot go lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story blurs the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own courtyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season, you have taken a new step with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I move forward with them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in a game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my trip to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are accustomed to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Sure, I did.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won many titles with hoppy clubs.
He's been side by side with some great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting conversation with him.
I was getting out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the lead.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive on the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title.
Last season, we didn’t go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, you are supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it’s sure to be a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team builds with time.
In the Champions League, we have proven that we can respond to those who are present.
Look at Manchester City, which hasn’t qualified for the 8th finals in two seasons, they’ve also made huge expenditures!
With regard to the amounts invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we can have the smile saying to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better to say there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and sets a lot of goals.
He's here for that, and he proves he's the Ligue 1 star.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I had the heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today, I am able to make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what has happened in Ukraine and we need to behave in an exemplary manner today.
What do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good zero (1-1) snatched on October 16 in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has fought for everyone.
“Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, Pay and Sell Without Banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from pair to pair.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after peaking at $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the prices are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competiting with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both bookkeepers, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public ledger, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, sort of a provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hash phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole thing.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular impression (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the imprint.
If, for fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because both have different footprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two on a regular basis, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by up to one hundred millionth, which leaves some margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computational power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The flaw used is not about the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Weight-loss actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, “giants” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which come back cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioning hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to become a reality, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take over its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, ex-refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, took place in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban outpost on Kabul as of the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the land of fire and blood due to the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overtaken by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They moved into businessmen, seizing government land to resell it on land to build to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They disregarded each other; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American expanses: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, both girls and boys.
Work will have to be provided for those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed opponents, loves mobile phones; television, and its Turkish whistleblowers that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the position of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industry has been restarted, no dam is in good condition, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Aynak’s copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s top employers.
It will also take some time for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to return to normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and minds" and to realize the impossible task of matching aids and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and has carried out by a small agricultural NGO actionability, many villages of interest and collective.
These works, greedy local workers, were able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, protection of the soil and increase of arable land.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, which are often over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me to wish for, a small, well-controlled civil aid should be maintained in their favour, which will directly affect them.
A Forceps Constitution in Egypt
This is a new poker move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it full powers, it has decided to play its part.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave this House two more months to finish its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "betray his word" and "troll the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that compels the Brothers to renounce their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy as the protest is raging across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
This hasty vote is based on an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "You either vote for my text or I retain full powers", which is supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, believing that they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it was most often unanimous that the articles were voted on.
Commentators were amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the constituent's pendulum was poorly regulated.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
In the end, article 2 remains the same as the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of sharia are the primary source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a pledge of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the liberals respond, who see it as a blow to communication.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
In particular, they refer to Article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular with regard to verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see in it the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could in the future be the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extended powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defense Council.
Civilian trials in military courts will not be banned, as was demanded by human rights associations.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticid.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no article echoes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march on them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Center of the World and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty took five great reasons to go to Israel.
Go and adore the holy places
Make yourself unavoidable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these “baptismal grounds” will be touched by Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is in this very place that Jesus appeared to His disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk along the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the Antonia fortress (the praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the burial.
This is where the Christian center of the world stands, a symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations which constitutes the remainder of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in Height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins lie on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to once inhabit the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
The country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth checking out.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (the parliament).
It is home to the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It mainly displays the impressionist and expressionist paintings of Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of mouldings of visitors and observers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children’s memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and enter it in total darkness.
The stars are shining.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
The three major seaside resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the temperature of the water does not fall below 21° while that of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure water contains brine and very easily retains swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
We come to perform treatment based on salt water, lemon, healing sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk through the narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to take photo sessions from all of Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (now 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the low and high parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on the Sabbath.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop operating.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve kosher food only, excluding pork, seafood, unscathed fish and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, molten chichi peas balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-fed cats that walk around looking tall.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These cats love passing places and do not refuse to be pampered.
Renting a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels per day.
Entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Which language has, to Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While lawmakers and human rights activists are controversy over what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since December 1, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker must pass a Russian exam.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Immigration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and the foundations of law.
You will need to validate your Russian language skills in order to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or diplomas of teaching before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Profit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions of Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews has been supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders had already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what is it going to do?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, according to the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, says Victor Sebelev, director of the office of the Russian Federal Service for Migration in Tajikistan.
Protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without an understanding of the language, Sebelev confirms, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and without paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passports, and they do not get the salary they expect," said Tolib Charipov, the head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of Tajikistan's migration service.
Don't argue with me, Officer!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to come to make money in Russia trust that they not only do not know the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but rather their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have anything to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people start earning money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
Examinations will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without statutes, there will be no official examination or work afterwards.
Yet, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then, you can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," Oumed Khuchkadamov, a Tajik national, told reporters.
“Hurry up, don’t lose weight and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Fake paper comes out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: this will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “paperbags”.
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first time exam to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian weapons carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it was the shootings carried out during the weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the carrying of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a permit to carry a weapon by increasing it from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee for security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were registered during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that tightening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market.
According to them, today in Moscow you can find any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black market of weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking gun controls
The first is the "military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of them have often suffered explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," the former military official said.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private weapons factories that do not compete with the competition on the international market and run out of weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,” one expert says.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"We find a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from gun portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market ended up there “due to employees whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "illegal excavations".
A salesman and consultant at an armory who asked to remain anonymous assures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these specialists of the clandestine search; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will look for new goods in military warehouses.
The person purchases a unit, e.g. a TT gun, through a sign.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a wire.
"He transports it to the city and resells it for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 per unit with two chargers," he says.
“It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers,” the seller adds.
"Like in a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I checked sites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to Begovaya station where someone had to take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun was given to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there you also have to come by saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them to him.
The little ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
“I thought I was in a luxury store,” recalls the soldier.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we go with the seller in the woods and we install a target.
“They let me shoot and when I’m convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes.
A shop from its sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we don’t need any documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," the ad reads on the site "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and is picking up people eager to buy combat weapons.
People stumble on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard of this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the right to a gun association.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, one can find oneself unarmed and behind bars.

Makarov for $100
Buying an illegal firearm, experts say, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a Gun" association, you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It came out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official data of the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has decreased in Russia overall by 7% and amounts to 22.9 miles, while the verified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
U.S.: employees of fast food and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teens go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practised by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will become larger or quickly faint.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the rise in modest wages received by basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the events want the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday," at a time when a torrential rain of balances seizing millions of residents has swept down on America and sometimes triggered riots.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their posts to organize strike pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from layers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many underpaid employees at Walmart shop only in their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests called for a salary increase, complaining that the price of the company's health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour, that’s a sum he can’t afford.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That's 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart shifted the entire pay rise on consumers’ shoulders, every race in the store would pay them an extra 46 cents.
They will spend $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over that period 5000 items at the second.
Its cash registers made a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
The company's spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "come-out operation among so many others" on the part of the organizer's union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, so they are not there yet) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s announces to sell billions of servings and then they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage required by federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast foods increase them over time, but little by little, its basic employees average in New York at $8.90 per hour.
No one touches them less than they do in this city.
It's inconceivable for me to live with that amount in New York.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald’s employees who complain about having to live with that salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are going to feed them.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food chefs be paid at least $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing it and punishing union protesters with bribes or redundancies.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, seizing fast food remains a difficult task, and this, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near Times Square’s McDonald’s with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, notably Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: “McDonald’s announces to sell billions of portions and after they don’t even give you honn sick leave and you don’t pay the work!”
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in sight, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said that "we all need to support fast food workers so that they get the fair wage and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important fast food event in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention not all of them were fast food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult at the moment to say if this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
“At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain.”
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceive augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model at its annual conference this summer, and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it turns out from the interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by the creation of virtual open spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained at the moment at the pixels on flat screen and sometimes at the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in controlling by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
Although Kinect has made physical interaction possible, many things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, at the moment, not really.
We’re trying to change that and we’re working on truly 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of our physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let’s get rid of those stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
It is appreciated, but is it not overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of their actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought about gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- Usually, I just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or can't do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual reconciliation.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you dislike about modern cameras?
Are they lacking in resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but rather the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to the latter point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave the touch sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would certainly need a device of this type in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames in the second.
Shouldn’t we increase the number of cameras?
The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a normal sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define locations.
"As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from a perspective of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone hands-on is not practical but this is what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transitional" that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes them strong (personal elements are the only ones you see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands don't feel anything!
What responses is your group preparing in relation to this challenge?
In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and that gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There's still one task below that will take a long time to do: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he's walking in an almost infinite open space - we're working on the concepts of running rugs (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also boules.
At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain, there are still many years of work to be done.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can cross near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the trendy parties and varnishes.
Kirill Miller's paintings always bring the crowds together, no matter where they are exhibiting.
He is one of the principally social and philosophical Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role due to his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you walking around the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pushinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to find myself at the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took my place in Pushkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy playback songs in moulding jerseys, among them was Igor Vdovin, a composer now fashionable.
When the band began to perform live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg animated a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education, it was here that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the last century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the award "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painting of the Year, and that’s when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new age with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a culture person.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have an actuality and a very strong acuity.
I'm going to have an exhibition scheduled "The Russian Museum Through the Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
I used to be a social worker, today it hurts and it's scary to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything is erased, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the costume that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't shake his hand, but we should spit on the trunk instead.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
Recently, we've seen you play the organ player of Barbary, and a cultural city must have that kind of hero.
Who else besides me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be neat, delicate, liquefied.
A disintegration of culture is occurring.
Before, people were divided into herds, supporters of the Bohemian loved one thing, the nihilists another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's the people we threw out who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, money, everything spoiled.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones you paint at the end of your life.
Nowadays, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are excluded, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and pave the way for them.
Currently, it is the "reign of taste" that is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you? - What's St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our stones, art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural background and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people who are going to see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.

Childbirth in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with landers on board set out in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much to choose from.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, even if only by hypothesis.
"It's about Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500.
We can only live there at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, we were experimenting with plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from earthly varieties.
Then, we put on orbit insects, small reproductive drosophilic flies.
In 1979, cauliflower eggs were sent into space to see how an unweighted embryo was developing.
At the exit we get a completely normal chick.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick needs to find support, it needs to get on its legs and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
In finding no support, the chicks were stirring in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The chicks did not respond to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We peeled their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological miniature ark with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the Bion biosatellite will only ship same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. We have to do this kind of research ", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
It's not a small business.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable of it, in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been going into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our mussel flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold up after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
“No one was answering that question,” said Vakhtang Vatchnadze, a retired space and rocket scientist.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been in orbit twice and even worked in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero floatability, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicular exits.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Little amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid in his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to water afterwards.
This is logical in principle, because from his birth until his first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the newly born child weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by leaning on the birth simulators.
Of course, you can prepare a childbirth in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
One cannot dress an infant as an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely disadapted," predicts the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, P. Igor.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time it will become a reality, when the Earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution for the Control of Public Finances) said: "the control of the pseudo-independent work (in Czech " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the higher institution of control of public finances, said in an interview with Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system " by Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDGs were not going to harass entrepreneurs with controls; is that allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority charged with going to inspect to demand compliance with the law," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German draft in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was it really about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for the way in which public procurement and specific national legislations are managed, as well as proper practice.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, we have noticed very interesting differences: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more stringent and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what is the result for you?
A common control of this kind should help us stop trying to clarify the laws, lower and improve the thresholds, when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by the paperwork that those who seek its flaws will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our CSI or a different mode of organization?
As for the institutions, similarly to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized similarly, it also has a board constituted slightly differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in an analogous manner .
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, but with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it also has accounts of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which in our country corresponds to state resources.
The public funds managed in our country by the regions and municipalities are controlled at the rate of the Landes accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model but it certainly cannot be said to do better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we regard as a model, also faces a whole host of problems.
Otherwise, they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, right?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, are its effects already being felt?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do a posteriori checks, we have to count on a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new "risk detection tool" with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public contracts - where these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and follow-up.
So, do you consider the passage of this law to be an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I think this bill is a step in the right direction and I hope the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was forcing the controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the market law constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really worth it to make the law tougher in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does it mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system banned or allowed?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demanding compliance with the law.
He may declare, “We will change the law and allow it,” but he cannot say that we will act as if it were nothing.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the tendering process.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are freezing, but most are still practical.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were this morning practicable, but in frosty and also snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and fluctuate between -5° and -10°C but they should rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the region and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the peaks of the Metallic Mountains (Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory) are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service showed that fog reduced visibility in some areas.
The R6 highway and the region’s national roads are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains to be exercised, for example on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
On some of their stretches remains of frozen snow and traffic jams.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by frost formation and that traffic-crowded snow can be found on roads in mountainous and elevated areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of frost formation in high-altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be ice cream in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on departmental and third class roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic packed snow is present on the roads in the areas located at altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather today will be mostly dry, mostly clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will usually fluctuate between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practical, although in some places it is necessary to be more vigilant and to adapt its driving to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication channels may be in frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway is practically uncomplicated, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The covering of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the Pilsen-South district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third-category tracks are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on less crowded roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc (region)
Drivers travelling to high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region must now count on a thick and soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>, after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field this night; according to road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are easily accessible.
"On the heights of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district there are remains of snow.
Drivers moving towards Jeseník should expect to meet at the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" a thick and soft layer of snow ", said today to <0xC4><0x8C>TK the head of road maintenance services of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
Their colleagues from Jeseník district also visited the site overnight; according to the latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district, roads are easily accessible, but in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district, drivers should be careful in sections of forested areas with wet roads.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, road maintenance services in North Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed in addition to some snow or ice-covered areas.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially to the southeast of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at the moment.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear skies and frost at night.
Difficult conditions are also reported from the main traffic axes on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of the snow until reaching the pavement.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we laugh rather and say that we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you come up with a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project to our readers in more detail?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the eve of 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will practically end when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to gather enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world titled " End of the world cancelled " (in Czech " Konec <0xC5><0xA1>veta annuleno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will you hear it at these charitable concerts?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point as part of a unique live broadcast by Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings there as well...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on in the framework of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the Tap association, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers be on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will be on stage.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the Czech Republic's home in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks like it at first.
We have five members in an electric chair whose crafts have to travel in the basement, of course we also trim a lot of luggage and instrument boxes.
So far everything has been more or less always going well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we came back recently, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public opinion attitude towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association striving to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
How do we catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe disability to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have athletes, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what drove you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I’m a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a musical activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x91>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we lost some control of the situation (laughs).
The success has come only in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
It’s true, creating connections with well-known singers and working actively to promote the band has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union grants, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But compassion is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take in compassion.
They are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means, of course.
I often say that when people with a disability achieve something, it is not just a breakthrough for them but for society as a whole.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many areas and demand a certain amount of discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, attend preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
One, Lada Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, we can't do anything about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the planned day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the band's song The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled" will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to raise funds (amounting to CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre located in Prague in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, the pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of ESA projects.
However, Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles worked on spaceflights; they did not always meet understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the auditors cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld received in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
This doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925, a drainage plant was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the drain.
The only information known about this drasin is that of the press at the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the preserved documents that this research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric rocket, drawn by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year was published the book "Raketa - torpedo azymna i rakietobomba lutnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were conducted by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronauticze).
For the first time, a company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problème, which contains four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowiczze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to astronomy.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and as early as autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakeita Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A, was built and, during the summer of 1959, two-stage RM-2 rocket flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket, developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B that volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Later, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is worth mentioning Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision has sparked a lively debate in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
In concrete terms, this means that the various economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital allied to unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wages) generate tension on prices.
The following meaning should be interpreted as meaning that a producer endeavours, by importing goods sold at a low price, to resist economic competition by "increasing" the price of the competitor, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thereby increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, or buying at low prices, or disappearing. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the state necessarily increase.
All this situation intensifies the perfect bad will of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damages caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so publicly known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to enter into a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the dictate of private capital prices, especially in the field of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, to the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and the deepening of the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot support their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a surcharge in order for them to reach the minimum standard of living.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live with wages of misery, in the margins of society.
The question is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian, or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are tired of saying that the state cannot invest capital in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and even direct today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and, by itself, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby that exists in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, by granting mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of bills to law firms closely related to the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The entirety of power does not come from the people, as stated in the constitutions of the Western type, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his work entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state was long in full deliquescence and the functions were assigned by violence.
The bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-the-table and corruption were proliferating without limits and the people were going to the elections with votes already sold" ... ... "Honest people did not seek to obtain functions, it resulted once the state was left 8 months without consuls".... ' It really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy "
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as in the past, there has been an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal-style democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of human lives, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and internally at European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen the investment of state capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of the violence and never will," Sting says in the song entitled Fragile, whose main verse of the refrain is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine, and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of repeated killings; all in all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a "behind the curtain" viewpoint on the one that mainly benefits from the tensions that have lasted for more than 95 years (starting with the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of a struggle for power.
In every epoch, we can find either Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their acts to someone who directed their acts according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to take place in a single generation.
Among the families with an astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the owl (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude him).
Little is written about them.
Of course I do.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world’s first news agency (Reuters) to put an end to linking their names to serious criminal acts they were involved in and that had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth, or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of the central rushese between Gaddafi only).
Anyone who tried to rise up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America's central bank status and began issuing his own money during the civil war (government, I mean) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing own money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 as he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Economic Crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for global power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to abolish colonialism, notably British, and the third was to reduce the world population from 1 to 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (the ecumenism is no other than a final solution).
The method used by the clan of the wealthiest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the Fed to avoid recurrence of crises like the ones they provoked in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start of the Second World War, the decayed bankers have allowed the politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they have imposed on Germany far-reaching war reparations thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it is then enough for them to place a leader sufficiently energetic, energetic and simple of the dukes).
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundation for a massive Jewish emigration to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the global acceptance of a juridical state.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany were the origin of World War II, the founding of the State of Israel lit a fire that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be, as it was during World War II, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of disagreement and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just see how people are severely divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where an injustice engenders another injustice according to a circle of endless violence and where, at the origin of everything, is the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
The difference must be made here between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as in our country, international bankers only propose their own candidates to people in elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical global example of a transgender fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of this country's membership in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) extend the world's conflict by 20 percent and become a global one.
In what light do we now see the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth with an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to bear on their hands or foreheads a mark of red iron, so that they may neither buy nor sell anyone who does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of its name.
It must be understood: that the one who has common sense takes into account the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number denotes man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of protesters made up of Islamist students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, in fact, it could not abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, further exacerbated later by the fiasco of the attempted release of the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused in the United States a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After difficult journeys, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rock-and-roll cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team who came to make footage for the shooting of a science-fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez received collaboration from Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The Affleck film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is partly a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a caper movie, the story of a successful hit, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The ambiances follow: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the epoch of events and the way, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck was able to start his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting has ceased to arouse ironic remarks.
Argo is her third feature film after the dark policeman Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The Town (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film not to take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of a place's atmosphere is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in Tehran’s bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director must have been content with a subject that actually offers few thrilling scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
He is doing very well, he sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway are quite hair-drawn).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it’s true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-workers, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they’re not, by far, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it lets itself be seen with a moderate interest, enjoying the direction and retro style of the 1970s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of yet another story, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he makes the case.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a public inquiry into the most absurd banking charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the most absurd regulations or ideas from the "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of major European companies was at the origin of our decision," said the organizer of the survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, less risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other as incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the requirement to add bio-components to fuels, which have harmful effects on the environment, or the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on price increases.
Criticism has also been issued in the past against the prohibition on the use of the term "butter to squeeze" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas should have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that in the Union bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or exhibit an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that made trade more difficult.
Standards on fruits and vegetables have been loosened despite opposition from some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize can be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that should include a warning on inflatable balloons that children under 8 should not bloat without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a US survey that balloons are, among toys, the first cause of suffocation deaths of children.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
We also have some weird ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue to Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the Let It Do association of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com named in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation concerning the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and was therefore liable to a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea is a handicap.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that, due to our wheat production, and following so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had to then export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for obtaining grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), these were, in concrete terms, to be used to draft requests for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Bizarre regulations are rare."
While the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning as well as its overall development are rather commendable.
More serious, for example, is the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but that have been imposed by Member States during budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, must fight in Brussels for the right to use specific denominations for these traditional products (a struggle that it does not always win) is arousing strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the denomination "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", for the denomination "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum" which dates back to the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the denomination "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, can bear the denomination rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU can be found today in the company of world-renowned cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck mass bread or Parma ham, cookies of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), carps of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> (Po<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>) lemel ("Po<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> and Kapo<0xC5><0x88>").
Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubicky perník") and cakes called "Cornets de Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice " ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ické trubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under lockdown and taxes and the retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, then I try to bring a solution for it to change.
And since I'm over forty and I'm an independent member of no party, I have no other way to influence the situation than to present myself in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Castle (N.D.T.: seat of the Presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I've always said that I'm going to fight for the Castle based on the results of the Senate election.
Subsequently, I clarified that if I were elected senator, I would run for office in the presidential election.
My goal is not function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we sit at the bar or in front of our television station, but that we cough up those who are trying to bring change.
Added to this is the press that breaks people’s reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said about me that I am bribing journalists or that I was the adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK] as the horse of battle.
To do this, you need to change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I pressed for tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause.
The problem is politicization: when someone arrives from the left or the right with a good project, it is deliberately rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma partisans, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself a right-winger or a left-winger?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me rather to the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you’re a populist?
But what you said does not prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of the parliament, you are left with only slogans.
You won’t survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal liability?
I don't have a choice.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there will be a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President by direct suffrage, which was achieved through public pressure.
I confess, without hesitation, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just got into politics and I'm trying to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things forward on my own, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know only one person can't make the difference, so I went to a number of personalities and asked them to run for office as well.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
The people have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don’t have time to check if each potential member’s past is spotless and then I don’t have the financial means.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my “transparent” account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate about 60 million the value of my personal belongings.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artwork worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid’s dream: I always loved James Bond, who drove a car, was galant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, have a $60 million worth of assets and don’t have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I borrow it?
I've already invested two and a half million in the countryside.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, paying my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run for office.
Are you going to continue your business activities in order to live?
Didn't you say you'd be deaf?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince yourself of it, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large nearby company, tells us, "Yes, it's really beautiful, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, no one goes to one of those sloppy libraries anymore, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeper city that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The 80,000-soul municipality has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to return some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to take back the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architects' office MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of mindful and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a richness on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, baffled and shouldering, Maas, the outcast, piled up his books of choice in order of size to make them a pyramid, and ended his argument-based speech with an "common dear!"
Here’s my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse’s books, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain sprouted from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and semi-detached houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this small dull village, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall of a stunning uglyness, whose white facades invite you to think that they shelter a dairy, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Sure, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you step on the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant street lights unequivocally speak the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and little girls who play ball.
And everywhere books, books, and more books.
"Normally, the library shelves are located along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," Maas explains.
We completely changed the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been neatly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes lambris, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers don’t want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager for the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in an agricultural enterprise frisson an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membranes with a thickness of one millimeter have been used for years as substrates in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to the maintenance of the ideal humidity level of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
“It’s amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books lies beneath a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on days of good weather.
Thick wooden beams mounted crosswise relative to the glass facade serve as a sunshade, intercepting much of the rays.
The ambiance is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even described the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "finally found soul".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the voids in the library that was not yet fully secured (today it counts 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
According to Winy Maas, “There is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not to be too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 insurgency in Libya, Germany also opted for abstention in the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
In the end, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy, so to speak, defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still striving to find this role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term “normal” foreign policy mean to the Germans?
It demonstrates a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national cases.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hit the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, as this is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is at least a decisive element in German strategic reflections.
Is Germany damaging its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
The United States, on the other hand, has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem to be.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is Germany finding it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must affirm their singular position.
This is what they are currently doing on the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will in the future take on a locomotive role and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that marks their independence more.
Does Germany see itself playing a major role on the international stage, does Germany just want to take on a key role?
Or is it always difficult to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She must compose with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this gap, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're only less appreciated, it's life!

"Mark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The trademark thus enjoys protection such that the company that bears the name of it cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, it's not sure she'd win a case.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in property infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives at my desk.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the sportswear manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a notebook in which are the recordings made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zegna DF Puma trademark, a name that the firm artificially created by owning part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and intellectual property infringement.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually only counterfeit goods.
Pattloch’s cases, however, are different: his clients charge him with tackling the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is by this term that women are referred to as those who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch said.
"The brand is sweetened, the uniqueness disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion, the world’s third-largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, it is not easy to delete dubious registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period, the criticized denomination had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay the plagiarist money, as he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo buyer, used a blue-and-white logo that resembled that of BMW, and the conflict was resolved and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the famous crocodile’s gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits, however, that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have gone last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a normality found".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, representing a 75% increase from the previous year.
Nonetheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the office.
Acting is expensive
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and it means that China is at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world for the tenth time in a row.
This would also apply to the total number of trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese plagiarism.
Indeed, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because family names can’t be protected in Germany,” said Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office therefore rejected the Munichers' objection.
Freudenberg certainly won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is at stake
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds, "the procedure is long, tempting and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to estimate internal costs, and the Archives Service has even had to review the records of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered in vain to the opposing party a "six-digit large sum in euros" to settle the dispute.
“That’s what we see what this means for us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the filing.
Wentzler adds, "vigilance is a must."
Pattloch and him advise German companies to be very cautious in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, rather foreigners should "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of its legal drama, the company should pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained by Wentzler.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir is rehearsing in Heidelberg, and Swaziland’s AIDS orphans are delighted with their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, you tap the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, shoes for ladies and moccasins for men look for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers are slowly amplified - alto, bass, tenor and soprano -, they are carried away, enchanted and followed.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers aged 23 to 69 have come, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorus has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
To be helped to help one another
UNAIDS, the United Nations program to fight AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
Seventy of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "singer of praise" in Zulu.
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this area, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return it to its native region: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest straw or earth huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjenje, the ailments that plague Swaziland on a smaller scale can be seen: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis mostly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothes, education.
In a poor country without a school diploma, there is no prospect at all.
At first, it was just a few people who personally pledged to pay a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But only a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been almost professionally dealing with Esitjeni's AIDS orphans.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhagia (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and gall belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhagia often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men causes at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamydia, trichomonases, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhagia and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, Chlamydia-related infections are significantly higher than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Moreover, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been decreasing.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, lower abdominal pain, as well as the appearance of buds and warts.
However, they regularly cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close body contacts.
Therefore, experts recommend that any person who frequently changes sexual partners take regular exams.
Most quickly detected STIs can be cured and delayed sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds raised by the choristers through their voices throughout Germany, the funds accumulate.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated, for example, with one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, as they are called the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American organization for health PSI, the association organized an HIV screening test for many residents.
This is not a matter of course, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
“Aids is a real taboo,” explains Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a subject that touches on sexuality.”
This is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned practices, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
There are condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but hardly anyone uses them.
The culture is different, flesh by flesh.”
In order to encourage some cultural exchange, the Imbongi choristers travel together every two or three years in South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with white people singing in the African language is a sign of recognition as it not only generates good mood and joy, but also sometimes tears up a few fearsome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their daughter-in-law.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
“Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there,” the people say.
And after a 8,733-kilometre flight of birds, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristers who kick their feet in the rehearsal room of Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that could go up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the lead scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unseen by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which the infinite is observed.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the birthing room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, dubbed "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope photographed the flaming glow of a dying star.
The donut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on colors.
In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
His resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles in astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any traces.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs ever taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the shining heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the prime of a cosmic craze in the constellation of the Serpent: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary domestic dust.
This photo was made from optical and radiographic photographs taken by different telescopes.
We can see the circle of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way galaxy.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, are also constantly creating young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with rays of light and pierced by a small black hole, there is not yet dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow larger and, thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Mount Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this picture was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is immense, the mirror alone reaching a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe looking for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo Radio Telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by using the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take photographs until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea's observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru and IRTF telescopes.
A new giant telescope is also expected to be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope is to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data has been indicating the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.

A survey of a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a twisted romance.
Around the many corners of the road, the small bus hovers along wooded hills, streams and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, you would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which not much is known, except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town of Plastronne with its overly aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not match at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one path.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilate Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Having another child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems more than dubious.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he would have still conceived a daughter.
Would <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the old man in Central Asia.
“Surprisingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz explains, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of documents, except that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is a fact that people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believes that it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical in the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a barn, whose contents she relentlessly beats.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and one daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also play in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armoured glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long braids of a dark blond that his son proudly reveals to us.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I have never used shampoo," Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live.
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the lead.
The language of propaganda marvels in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the nation’s paternal figure, a man who nevertheless ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly of Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats per month (approximately the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good livelihood in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-standing son is right: “the elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution was revived in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the country’s deep fracture.
The Sharia-based draft constitution is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy with words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,” he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but also and above all to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For all the members of the confused and desperately despairing opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologising, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hurriedly drafted by the 100-person Islamic-majority constituent assembly during a fifteen-hour night force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word “principles” really mean?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists are using the vague formulation and the resulting legal maneuvering margin to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, this suggests a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all matters pertaining to Sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its splendor radiates over the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto result in the custody of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts used to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, as the draft reads, protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values”.
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids insulting or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
Many points are therefore to be interpreted in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will be the subject of a referendum among the Egyptians "very soon".
"The Revolution Reappeared"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop the sharia before it comes into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election, said.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the garbage dumps of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
“If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated," Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition, told Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-protest not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was being organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
“Clean up our country!” they asked Morsi, claiming that “the Qur’an [was] their constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have engendered a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that’s what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the votes of the leadership that the country must take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regretted during his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto strips him of all his powers,” Saeda said.
However, a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who watches the battle between the different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway rakfisk: is it the most odorous fish in the world?
The five million people who inhabit Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the locals’ appetite for an extremely smelly fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty footwear.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this odor, ubiquitous, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt sprinkled trout and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it is cold, Norwegians gather in masse to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
“You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also known as ‘Rakfisk General’, who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and pour a large amount of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard adds.
Drinking kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it’s not bad – it reminds you of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels and then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - undoubtedly with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Nowadays, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, crossed the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, though odorous, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> each.
Norway does not often speak about it in international news, which is not to his displeasure.
Here, people are reluctant to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who shot down 77 people, including women and children.
When they evoke this killing, they speak of the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians have a hard time accepting that in their peaceful country one of them could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," says Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in hand.
We are – as you say – cautious people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out the window, during the years that led to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its stock exchange tight.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and line up to buy me something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger made of momentum, a real discovery, it is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying in is one of the many places where you can serve rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or maybe the most smelly of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
I think we're in the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a tough start.
As incumbent President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, the BBC's Will Grant is interested in the challenges ahead and the expectations of the people, which are many.
The road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security dam has been in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nonetheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits you.
Mexico’s economy is doing well, with results due to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populous and sprawling state that encloses the capital. On its preferred land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic community of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevasses.
Plates bearing his name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are counting on him to bring about lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for the real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who blame the new president for lack of charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image the people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more blatant.
Hidden under the highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to combat drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a devastated area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the edge of a landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto’s detractors say that at best he failed to curb the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this decayed neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came to her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the body stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old commer, a troublemaker, a weeping woman.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
“But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has promised to make it his priority during his term.
“I hope he will be as good as when he was governor,” said Olvera, a member of Congress in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter allegations of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during detention.
The trial is about Manning’s detention at a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's seizure took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the largest leak of confidential information in the entire history of the U.S. military -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a counter-interrogation with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Major Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The counter-interrogation -- during a hearing, the defense filed a petition demanding that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the seizure took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his tenure.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning, during his detention at the military prison of Quantico, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had reserved for him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received within the prison was overall "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems mentioned.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn't mean I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to evoke the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military said it had assigned it this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for its protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know I was doing well, and I wanted this status to be removed ... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Marine Corps military prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had contemplated suicide while in Kuwait and had fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very annoying.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest part of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had at his disposal were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also clarified that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards could not see his face when he turned at night, they would wake him up so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning, during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard's order that he should let go of his blanket that might have hidden his nudity, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to let go.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his panties or tongs to injure himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, tongs, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he experienced during his detention and that he will greatly reduce his sentence if he is found guilty in a martial court, a trial expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors arguing that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to the national defense.
If all the prosecutions are detained, he is sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
The signs indicated two ways: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which line to go to.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" all my life.
It’s an ethnic term, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves “Irish,” or my friends in New York when they call themselves “Italian.”
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw my grandfather be born, there is no need for a special qualification or a line of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in one or the other language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the "Foreigners" queue.
I was thinking about that moment of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are staying in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing half of their territory at the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are undermining their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country maintains with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about bitterness?
There are a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- dark, unskilled skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they cough us up as if we were individuals of lower strain and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans more firmly claim their identity and Mexican-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as wealth ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that we absolutely need to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not going to happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the ubiquitous wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to deal with it alone, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want to be forgiven for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started it, dozens of buildings have been dusted; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the city's capital, and the city's metropolis.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that it could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
While the November 21 ceasefire continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will be proud to have forced the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has suffered a crackdown.
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed back the 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken action for Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamic states.
Hamas members rejoice and say that the Islamist rising curves around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia is exercising its domination, through Syria, where rebels of Islamist tendency can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies led the way.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is Hamas’s cousin, and its leaders are more likely to turn to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hardline will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system proved to be effective and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears – for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the cause of the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide bombings, notably through the barrier of separation that encroaches on the West Bank, the main chunk of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements from international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman on the approach of the January 22 election, has the nice part.
Why are these Palestinian bastards giving them a state?
If they were to lead the West Bank, wouldn’t they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of the head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win; but the Arab Spring may change.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which is good news -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dustbin that is destined to explode one day in Israeli-occupied territories — a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to call Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now seek to end the flow of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also press Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
New Neutral Cigarette Packages Act Enacted in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world first, with logos and colors being replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking from their parents.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all the packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown from a logo to a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on the bill.
Tobacco manufacturers have said it would revive black market trade, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
“There will be harmful consequences from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the lawsuit and lost the lawsuit.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting inventory renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only annoyance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV ads, sports sponsorship, and the obligation for retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by local businesses and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the must-have place par excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to wonder if it's a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video, or if it's an agency-orchestrated marketing campaign?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade deals with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
Currently, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know them.
"You take a cigarette and you store the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of the purchase of a package showing a picture of a tumour in the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult to store the packages on the shelves.
"Before it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is boring enough, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development are praising boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us — and our children — to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nurture creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yes.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of “Boredom: A Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience consisting of “willing to do something but failing to embark on a satisfying activity.”
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though they would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is “the disruption of the attention process, associated with a messy mood and the feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who get bored tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when it is actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person's magazine article on the train.
Some bands heard, from the next room, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third band didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups – they had difficulty concentrating, but didn’t know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or tedious task, a distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like looking at objects on a editing string, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you twist or scratch, these gestures, often considered signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to whine learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay motionless,” Fenske said.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocorded voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a “Boring Predisposition Scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, “Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially needed numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blased.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if today's boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "teenageness is a period where boredom reaches its highest level", notably because children and teens don't have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take ridiculous physical risks, gamble or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Boring is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t have learned to take care of himself or to self-learn, Professor Fenske says.
And “this self-regulation moves from one situation to another,” he said.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gains more mastery of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
I don’t think we should criticize it either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant buzzing generated by activities and technology is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no guidelines for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco said that one day in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and material that could be used for his consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of businesses involving low drug use depends more on the location than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been classified without a trace.
Police have stopped indicting adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative constituencies have called for accelerating existing marijuana cases and continue to indict those who own it.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales outlets in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so fast that I don’t know what the future holds,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
The Washington State regulators are also asking themselves a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, authorizing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first with regard to therapeutic use and now with regard to personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it’s a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could rely,” he said.
Washington's law, called I-502, comes into effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal gap, during which the permit system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
In the meantime, practical questions remain: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees adequate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales shops within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or nursery.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install a licensed cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and over who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop indicting people for this type of crime.
Chief Oates said police would enforce new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, "district attorney" Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession affairs, primarily in order to pressure users to have them detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those people who have committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favor of restricted marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer show up adults for possession of limited quantities.
County Public Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger backed the decision, but also decided not to unnecessarily classify all marijuana possession cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a proper legal and governmental framework for personal marijuana use is not an easy thing.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
“It’s a cultural barrier” with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent much of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they’re struggling to accept it as legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are in the process of becoming a case law for drug legalization.
As advocates and state representatives foresee a new border of legalized sales, they look forward to federal government directives, which still designs marijuana sales and culture as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed therapeutic marijuana stores to operate in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While it’s true that the police aren’t likely to sneak through the doors to seize small bags of drugs, it’s hard to bet that they’re opposed to licensed marijuana sales for personal use authorized by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration policy adviser.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana stores, even though it was only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is given to someone and then face a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a Tory (conservative).
It’s not just today’s students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a sort of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said facetiously that I was gone after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been the victim of bullying and was the subject of constant bullying.
Not because of my name, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowing, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my regretted father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative Party supporter.
Why talk about this today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have found that a new generation of center-right students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Student Room (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable” because of their political views.
They want a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Land of Wonders: Young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to student politics, which portrayed the "Tories" as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
Among them was a student named Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moved in Rolls-Royce, wore a silver suit and moved with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students are said to be treated as emissary goats of the establishment of increased tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the “Nottingham University Conservative Association,” told a Sunday newspaper “there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, UOCA's president, says there has been a deterioration in the JRC's attitude towards people who are center-right.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one thinking that way during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and with a paralyzing timidity.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
The university had voted last year to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher – a former student – an honorary degree, due to reduced funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when the new students got acquainted with others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I discovered that not only did the teachers participate in the sarcasm towards the Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on striker minors, privatization and the government’s opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the woods of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I suffered was a translation into English of 18th-century French texts, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustule face, was easily carried away.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said in a gruesome tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner tonight, I sat alone and then I felt a slight slap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student named James, who presented himself as a member of the UOCA.
"I know who you are," he said, gently.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even harder for you.
Most Tory youths claim to be Labourers.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I stressed that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
This strategy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have resumed the chorus.
I was perverted, shit.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like gay before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Would I have been able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who shared the same views only after nightfall?
Should I become a Labour and reject my opinions?
The next three years would resemble a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started taking the shuttle between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dream bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's to make fun of you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a work session the following week, when another history professor suggested the most serious thing in the world, that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Inwardly blushing with shame, I admitted to being the victim of my parents’ brainwashing and called them “old fools.”
The rest was short-lived.
It was my father who shoved the last nail of my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch’s press every week.
My door was locked.
I was stuck in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back there.
You can call me a wet weary chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such bullying in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also has an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: un Maître de la Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his sewing house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ point of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest fashion designer of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t squeeze their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We would all love to be invited to his Gstaad cottage," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza has not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Plaza de España, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
"He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobility lineage parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves people with great titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-metre-wide manicure podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade on the podium to admire a "dream public" wearing Valentino's main creations, such as the tailor who had chosen Jackie Kennedy in his marriage to Aristotle.
Among this audience of models, we find names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
This was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the fashion designer’s muses.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his femininity, his great love for women, and because he sublimates our beauty,” said the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors it uses, they are bright and brighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Eventually, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a fleece skirt, a draped bustier and a collar to fall off.
“It was a dream come true,” said Rodrigue d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timelessness,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the couturier with the utmost care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that she carries.
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of lace and a trail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obfuscated for years by the “knowledge” of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any husband of his clients.
“His refinement, his calmness, his well-groomed and perfect appearance have always caught my eye,” says d’Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The World's Hardest Job: Kawah Ijen's Human Mules
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilograms of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with air.
After harvesting large sulfur rocks, which weigh in total nearly 70 kilograms, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted bearers take more than 40 minutes to climb that distance, at a turtle’s pace, keeping their balance and measuring their steps to avoid stumbling and falling into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur extracted.
Once up, they make a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers up to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, we can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
She then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138.000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the fields.
“The income of minors is very high here, where coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the bearer who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not so difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a girl who ramoui to Bali, where they are Hindus".
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to pay him the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Ruined by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares a mass of unhealthy wood with other wearers, gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulfur does not cease to sprout at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater illuminating himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
About 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to wearers who work on their own and are paid to the weight.
In addition, they also do not touch one of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not for humans,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old bearer who has been working at Kawah Ijen for 30 years since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can" because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which they obviously add their usual breathing problems, deformed by arthritis and stenosis.
By balancing the basket on his back, 53-year-old Unanik can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and he extracted 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transported to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers from there by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but perpetuated misery from generation to generation is one of the most difficult jobs in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah Ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this absence of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint pills, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychine in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this ad.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we have been able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt it was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we said the following: what could be more creative about solving this problem than making it a rap song?
1.2 Children
The Singaporean government is not taking it that lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population distribution, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it found itself above 2, considered as the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, said it was due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the constitution of a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with xenophobia barely disguised against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they will not have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people put it back to later,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," another 20-year-old told us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under the age of 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, ages 10 to 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
“I won’t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone," he said.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share one of my photos or anyone who would be stupid,” he said.
The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine Twitter followers.
The majority are from the family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just post them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends, quickly,” he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend him a stranger.
The case of José, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his friends list.
“It doesn’t bother me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one made any advances or asked for his address or phone number.
“If they were putting pressure on me or demanding it, I would just delete them from my account,” he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences known today as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was racked up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just took it to a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
“Even if I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the advent of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,” she said.
Porras notes that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master’s degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book “Native and Digital Immigrants,” uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they, children and young people are born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we ourselves are learning,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the necessary maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences.”
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“When it comes to the Internet, everyone has to act with respect, morality and other principles, it has to be the same on social media,” she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education advisor, says that it is essential that parents carefully read the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an online account.
“For example, the age and what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The UNASUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public.
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven present mandate holders.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the summit was closed, then claimed that it would be published from one time to the other on the Internet site.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by Peruvian President Ollante Humala in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was constantly restricted.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The few reports circulating among journalists were those given by the press attachés of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the summit's "final statement," but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American Arab Summit (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it was urgently requested by the press, it also did not disseminate the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the obtaining of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that sets a different border between the two countries.
Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ’s decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima has filed against Santiago and that begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing today before this international court,” President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties, and international courts,” Piñera said in a statement.
The two presidents’ confirmation that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been suspended from UNASUR since 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR's countries would implement "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphal matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and foresee a better future for our populations,” concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connectivity of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the cross-axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not provide further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," he said.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace with good relations with its neighbours is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a ICJ ruling requested by Bogotá.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all of these pathways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with that country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they planned to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of UNASUR, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," Correa said.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who took part in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "had been interspersed during World War II" and other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by UNASUR member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President was in favour of the reestablishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who knock our ears off never compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but on the contrary he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were substantiated suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish court, which has demanded that he be subjected to an interrogation on his territory regarding an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish law allows this to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk of Assange’s mental and physical health deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorated by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“It affects anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa notes that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the assignment of a safe-haven that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has initiated a whole series of proceedings before different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted the safe-driving as early as tomorrow, it would be over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and he clarified that what he did not tolerate were " mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil politicians or perverts but bad journalists who are paid for greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that it is not this kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than pushing forward his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and trace the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay within UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "it would destroy the legitimacy of paramocracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian president considers "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They must be solved as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile within the same court and said it was "beneficial for Latin America to bring the international proceedings if both countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it may be".
Referring to the possibility of his nomination for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, for a third consecutive term, he said he saw this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primary, he would retire from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and I would then retire from political life.
If we ever lose, I will too.
“It’s my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean a relapse of President Chávez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Today, AIDS-related deaths are due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV positive.
“It was as if the sky had fallen on my head,” he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make “less painful,” in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it and his hard work was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmata.
Then even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first cases reported, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he took this information in public reference.
The infectiologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and the quality of life depended on the level of affectation of the immune system presented by the patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not consuming 50 years.
Simply put, it means that for someone who would receive an HIV positive diagnosis at age 25, “as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years,” the scientist interviewed explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients identified on the basis of national data have been diagnosed.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths as of May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never missed medication, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, which is what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, it is necessary to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who ask for it.”
The specialists and members of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already suffering from AIDS.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I blow up three times a week," they say, that's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march against the Jo Mondiale.
Let them take the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, that is very good, but as a result, even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teens don't want to hear, the journalist assures.
He proposes to redirect this ineffective distribution; that condoms should not only be sold to counters, but also be found in public toilet distributors and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying for the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had responded when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
“This is not how sexuality works, it’s best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
Numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the 4th country in the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and the 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of contamination occurs through sexual contact, 6% through blood and 2% through perinatal contact.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for every recorded case there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A judgment ratified in appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt consented through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario creates a damaging precedent for all domestic companies with ramifications in the neighboring country and having solvency problems.
Thus, it seems that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star-studded flag, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the ruling by Judge Harlin Hale of the North Texas Bankruptcy Court on June 15 left Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of an embargo on their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s main glass manufacturer to sue the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case notes that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the vote inter-societies, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by subsidiaries of Vitro to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican law recognizes this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are here half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies had guaranteed the debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, in any way the Vitro creditors who fought against this in the United States courts, i.e. the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the increase.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation it has been facing since 2008 without stopping the serious economic crisis facing the United States, repercutting costs on the country.
For now, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same appeals court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and requires the trial to be reviewed by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the court") detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this would free him from the agreements signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as the United States' failure to comply with paragraph 15.
In addition, he noted that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensure equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they assomme Vitro and they assomme the country.
General balance sheet
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were silenced for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Aviation Pilots has already encountered problems.
The proceeding, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw 198 million pesos from the F/589 trustee of IXE Bank on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds were allegedly used for the purchase of shares of the Hotel Professionals Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
They're besieging the Dragon Mart
Meeting over the weekend in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the Great Wall Country, with a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the Southeast area to oppose the monumental project that is located in part on protected areas and represents the largest of all the threats weighing on the industry.
The ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this topic is already in ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was good that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was seen as an infringement of freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
“Hetin” Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life on the field and, thanks to him, has travelled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a cerebral haemorrhage sentenced him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayer Basket President or Bayer President.
"I have worn several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his 50-year-old fiancée.
“Basketball is my whole life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind him of his out-of-standard itinerary, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those that remind him of his time as a player in the team of the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"These have been my best years, the ones I've enjoyed the most because I've had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
This has been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired during the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager, took the lead of the team," Reyes says.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a tough player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
This is how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He enjoyed the championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his duties and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn’t made us play the last game again,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we put a scratch on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only made up of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world 90 problem.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the Imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
What is your biggest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN counted up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys play only in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island during the national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of compulsory certifications and courses for executives, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night from complications of cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas".
“Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press attaché, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television as an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the film are well received by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman experienced his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan “Who Killed J.R.?”, invented to entertain the suspense around an emotional episode in which Hagman’s character is nearly murdered, has generated worldwide speculation and millions of dollars played in betting.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had conceived her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to detain his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the Honest Citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled this Friday Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is underway, the channel reported.
So far, neither Warner nor TNT have announced how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who met celebrity with such classic works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the stages of New York theaters in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les mémoires implacables de J.R.)
"I have not written anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them back their trust, I come with them when they have surgery and afterwards," he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer them some comfort, like “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a little while, but it’s going to be okay.”
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "end of the world" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistible hook there: the end of the “great countdown” of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many people refer to as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what was awaiting him over the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax loophole that some have dubbed the "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the late Christian theorists would think it would decay.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we tell it, it was a very good time.
And remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he’s not the only professor to give lectures on “the end of the world” this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t disappear,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his high-level student course, consisting of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate that.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us to believe in the end date of the world on December 21.
“Our first project dealt with Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old West Chester-born last year student at Temple.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is a centuries-old anxiety about the apocalypse in Western culture that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in such speculation.
“In other places around the globe, people don’t think about it,” he said.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is giving classes in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that we were giving classes here on "the end of the world."
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, the many supposed dates of the Last Judgment have been discussed, and he claims that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many have told us that they thought they were going to "end of the world" parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
