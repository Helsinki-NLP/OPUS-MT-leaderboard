I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in a terrible, from the Jewish point of view, Galilean dialect of Aramaic instead of Hebrew, thus showing the invalidity of claims about the existence of any sacred language, the use of which in prayer is particularly close to God.

Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you convince her?
I've been to Sapporo before.

We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We sat in the depths of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy at that store?
When will we have a woman president?
He came here hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is close to our school.

I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The black mansion was broken.
Why don't you go kill yourself?
Tom was the first to speak.
Did you ask Phoebe to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he's supposed to mess with me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We will have a few guests tonight.
Her voice is still ringing in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you a few questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the case.
Why don't we have dinner at the restaurant tonight?
Some birds did not fly.

What did Tom ask you?
I told Tom you came to Australia.
Is that what you were looking for?

What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?

Take them to the hospital.

Tom would like us to stay.
I'm on the ladder.
It is the largest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't doing it.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done it.
How's the weather?
I texted her.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not introducing me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She was crying.
I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like to live outside the city?
How long did it take you?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's boss.
Who are you planning on going to Australia with?
Someone was yelling.
Which is better?
We are grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Tom to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves at 3:30.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the animals from the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please take a look at this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't fall in love with your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.

Tom just got out of prison.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I've found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you would have done the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
It is only in philosophy that one can use the vicious circle in evidence and gain a high appreciation for it.
I can't afford to have children.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they couldn't make these idiots understand their own language.
Shall I go?

I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
It's ten o'clock, my mother must be mad.
The white bread, please.
Owls are cute.
Tom is illiterate.

The danger has passed.
We need more wood.

Let me know if you need any help.
We need to get there before he does.
He must be missing her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris far away?
What time is it in Tokyo right now?
He said he hoped to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Kahlo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you know.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
Do you think there will be snow this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from a friend.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like a cup of coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have a second chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All the bills have to be paid by me.
She clapped.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom is pulling Mary's hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a firefighter.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to register!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazy one I know.
Mary's already dressed up in her room?
This time I will forgive him.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom was not a good coach.
He's sober.

Tom won't win again.
Why don't I stay with you?

I was crying.
Tom wants to learn to play the trombone.
Get out of here now.
Can I take a look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas with you to replace the zipper on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
That's how Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's the memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to a concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom sprinkled the pancakes.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in pyjamas?
How much does it cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
You're a Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom in the middle of the third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew that Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's nice.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba all languages are equal.
The infection got into the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a gift.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom sometimes watches TV.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I still don't think so.
Run, you chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my opinion, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two o'clock.
Mary was not thirsty.
It wasn’t as hard to fall asleep as he thought.
I don't like that.
I was trying to wake Tom.
They say the film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Take care of your little brother.
Tom said he's not going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you already had dinner?
I love the bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympics.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There is no invincible.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know that Tom can paint.
They're dirty.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you kill her?
Does Tom speak French?
He learned Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom gave Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the newspaper on the table.
What did you learn?
If the weather permits, we'll head to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes shone and sparkled, and his usually pale face came to life and was covered with blush.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Take one more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were blue from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it cautiously.
I find it hard to solve this problem.
The typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me get your baggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to play and practice like my Japanese friends.
Why are you staring at me?
No one's gonna blame you.
I'm not really busy right now.
Children like to play more than to learn.
He was taken for his younger brother.
What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my dad.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary is in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don’t like people who talk about politics.
Is it red or white?
We are not afraid of battle.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm on my way!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom is not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife here.
Did your ears suddenly go into fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to waste so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom's pirate suit.
It's the pure truth!
Let's go to the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes that Mary knows that she shouldn’t do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll save you.
We are proud of our achievement.
That's why we had to invite Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a taxi.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is the one he pretends to be?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sine tooth, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
Tom could have stayed longer.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
There's nothing wrong with it.
The last few days have been very hot.
He was wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You're not allowed in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
Tom likes to read Hermann Hesse.
Honestly, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases reach the court, it is generally accepted that the jury consists of twelve people.
What was Tom doing at the Australian embassy?
Tom and I started seeing each other.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very confused.
I didn't know Tom was expecting me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized that something was wrong.
We had no idea what Tom was going to do.
Here's another day gone.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We are impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, hurry up, we're late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you monitoring your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her in my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is known worldwide for its hamburgers.
Tom gave Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The castle is broken.
Diamonds are a precious stone.
Enjoy the biscuits, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
She wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll be waiting for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was it too simple?
What Alice encountered, waiting for an answer, was a sudden war. It was a loud noise, so sharp that it would tear her drums apart, and so loud that it would reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
That's why you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her stuff into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she had asked of him.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You had to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn’t lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
The way he looks, the way he responds.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I am learning is very difficult.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has ruled for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Couldn't you solve this question?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
Twenty floors in the building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have any photos of Tom.
Can you wait a minute?
Will you give something to Tom for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I will be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't dare to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn as an ass.
I think you can be trusted.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in a dream last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but there was a girl on the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with children.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got small chunks.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't hurt her.
I'd better stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea in mind.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and orderly.
I suspect Tom's gonna have to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on someone else's land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How do you feel about your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough to eat.
We need a new curtain in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's a leftist.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
She's got leg pain.
This is a risk we cannot afford.
Can you give me a minute, please? I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do that again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do that.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, it's opening time.
I'm not sure what size it is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the lantern and walked into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked out of the door.
We have to do it.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn’t admire them?
He and I were crying.
You don't want to try again?
Just wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like that?
From milk you can make butter, cheese and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her relative?
When you drink water, don’t forget those who dig a well.
Did you know that Tom has a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself decently.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I've smoked before.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He blinked in response.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Didn't you think about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say it in human language?
No one was hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.

We both wanted to eat.
Tom has nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here! Stop here!
You did a great job.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.

I can't let you risk your life.
You are photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let’s talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," said Tom shyly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
It hurts.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
On the attack!
Look at the price list.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I've been somewhere else.
Do you have any questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: one day it will be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
You were loved by everyone.
He and I are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is it a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.

Let us take care of it.
I suppose you're sitting in my place.
I was planning on doing it yesterday.
It’s a bit early to drink alcohol, isn’t it?
My parents don't like my way of dressing.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That's gonna be interesting.
I hit him swiftly and hard.
Because it's worse?
It's inexpensive.
Can I take your hand?
He's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't sleep all night.
Open the door!

Road accidents occur on a daily basis.
Where did you go skiing?
Have you been to the barber shop?
The prospect is disappointing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ballpoint pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.

Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.

I have no doubt.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.

I can't believe Tom doesn't really want to go with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.

Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son from me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
It's your dog.
What are you talking about?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm gonna go to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't mean to bother him.
The officer instilled courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying similar things right now.
I'm not very good at hunting.
This is my first time cooking grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone already knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what he meant by Tom.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw how he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the policeman his driver's license.
I get my hair cut every month.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an acid apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let’s not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go, too.
Are you taking a job from home?
According to mythology, Prometheus stole the sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.

I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than I do.
There are a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't care about them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring in your best game.
We accept checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars shimmered in the night sky.
I doubt that Tom will win.
"Eh, here you are so bored". - "My boy - N, all the world aspires to..." - "Here I am! Your Majesty, Genon and his servants have captured the island of Korydai." - "Hmm-hmm. What can we do..." - "As it is written, only Link can overcome Genon." - "So we can."

What kind of music do you listen to in the car?
I was told three hours ago.
Take mine. Take mine.
The French Revolution began during the reign of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It will entirely depend on him.
I met a classmate.
He’s old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our city was engulfed in smog.
No one saw them come out of the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We were talking about you.
