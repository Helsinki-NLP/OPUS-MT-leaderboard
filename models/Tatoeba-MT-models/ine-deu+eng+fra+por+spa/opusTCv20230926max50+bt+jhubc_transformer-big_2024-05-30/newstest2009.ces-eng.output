The Prague Stock Exchange fell to a minus at the end of trading
After the morning's sharp collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares accounted for almost half of the normal daily trade.
Since the start of Tuesday’s trading, the Prague Stock Exchange has been in a downturn since Monday, when it has fallen nearly six percent.
This time, the stock market is down on Wall Street.
This is how the market reacts to the result of the U.S. House of Representatives vote, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the financial sector there.
The fall of stocks in Asia
The stock market in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices eventually wiped out some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong declined nearly four percent during trading, but later some of the losses were erased and the decline was reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually fell to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent, according to the index.
“The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly return to talks and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Other countries are at risk of being affected as well.
Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (nearly CZK 12 trillion).
The lawmakers ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday and major stock indices saw their biggest decline in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, and it last saw a decline of a similar magnitude in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal in the House did not pass, the index found itself in a free fall.
Congress says U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
The top U.S. Congressional officials and President George W. Bush’s government agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
However, it has not yet been won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
According to sources, the plan could be voted on in the Senate on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that a bailout plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
But then there will be "sobriefing" due to the complexity of the mechanisms to help markets achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
"We have resolved our differences of opinion on what the shape of the market stabilization package should look like," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
It should buy back non-sale mortgage assets from financial companies, which draw financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still have a recovery plan to go through, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis is severely affecting stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in a time zone where Congressional decisions could affect Monday trading.
However, it is not yet clear when both chambers of Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the last-minute talks can be stuck on any problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount allocated to the aid scheme shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has demanded.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, in the wake of another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress in the negotiations
The president may veto the decision, but Congress may overrule his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to acquire finance to buy back bad mortgage securities, whose value has declined because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, has been preserved.
“We worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restrictions on gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the negotiator-in-chief, said the legislators agreed on responsibility for the monetary program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing reliefs, timing of financing the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
It should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayments on the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayments for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Chief Economist Patria Finance David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“It’s because we don’t know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be redeemed.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week, according to Mark, is not as important.
“It is much more important for Congress to agree this week that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement for approval is of the utmost importance at the moment,” Marek stressed.
Battle on the blade of a knife: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you on how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
Yet there are plenty of reasons for a person to buy a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the claims of the future owner.
It’s probably hard to get a top-notch expensive turntable at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album on it.
On the one hand, such music products on LP records are not based and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if your shelves are full of vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues, you are probably at least dreaming of such a phonograph.
The same goes for music on the go, that is, music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For someone it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, just as a fan of Pink Floyd will hardly try headphones for twenty crowns from the marketplace.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life.
Some high-end music players can do much more than just playing music, but what most mobiles don’t even happen to do by chance.
No device today is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone and e-mail, he can play music and video, record both, has a better camera, a worse camera, and maybe even can navigate.
And taking into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than 10 hours, usually much less.
In this sense, the music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobile phones, you can expect that they will not play for longer than a few hours.
If you still call here and there, get another charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won't have this problem, even the worst ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation per charge.
Another problem arises when recording music to a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and in addition, not all of them can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to a memory card, but only a few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
You don’t need any special software for players except for the exceptions (iPod).
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players will already create a music library, sorted by the name of the performer, the album name, the genre or, for example, user ratings.
Some devices display only the directory tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobiles are more capable
When selecting a specific device, you are particularly interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, control comfort.
If your music is the backdrop and you listen to it every day just for a short time, like in a tram, you just need any mobile phone that plays MP3.
This is something that almost any mobile can do.
You don’t even have to watch what music formats your mobile or player can do.
MP3 can handle everyone and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and besides it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
All you need to do is visit the relevant website of the operator (or another provider) and buy a song or album.
This service in itself could already be a good argument for the acquisition of a music cell phone.
Unfortunately, the operator's offer is poor and is usually limited to fast-soaked radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that the music industry will dominate this way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in the future.
Most people still carry their cell phones with them.
Whenever you get the urge to listen, you touch your phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you also always carry headphones or at least wired handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be for many price.
The cheapest cost is usually less than $3,000.
For three and four thousand crowns you will get a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of an output to ordinary headphones.
The best and technically the most equipped phones even with a 3.5 mm hole for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by everyone.
The minimum of features, the similarity of controls with a previously common cassette player or, for example, a gramophone is obvious.
There is no danger of a collision in the form of an accidentally turned on mobile Internet and then a huge account for data transmission.
What kind of device to touch
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, touch Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than 1,100 kronor.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, go for specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus closer to a separate MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman phones have the same user interface as standalone MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand kroner, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take you MP3 players from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Possibly.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classic ones cheaper.
Maybe he won't be long.
We have written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
In fact, it was also confirmed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which noted that the price of SMS is higher with us than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and penetration over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, are keen on the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) Council, also often reminds them of this, who has expressed several times in the past that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network does not seem to have much chance (by the way, it would probably be hard to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant price reduction, to which classical operators had to respond.
However, even before the introduction of a stitch like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, similar voices were heard in the UK as in our country.
However, it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator has managed to attract more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to work efficiently, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost operators – they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a bet on an undefeated target group can also be a pretty good move.
The company is specifically focused on men.
"Administrative guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is hard to say if a similar concept as in Poland could catch up with us.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for Vodafone, said: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings.”
In the Czech Republic without a chance, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor arises.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hidden for a long time by the GTS Novera group, which would like to take the next step to become a real competitor of O2 Telefónica in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already managed to make progress in the negotiations," says group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe it's flashing for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that we should wait for the first virtual operator perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its emergence is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not think that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has addressed us with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>en from the O2 Telephony Press Department said in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová said: “We have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further.”
He added: “A virtual operator will hardly appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would already have to have a concrete agreement on the table in order to be able to think about it in this short term."
Vodafone refuses its attention rather to meet the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "By working with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most profitable from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for high-speed mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with one-handed operators
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a fall in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when the operators are about something, they are able to pull a rope, is also evidenced by the pulling around the creation of the U:phone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards CTU went at the time of the creation of the U:fon from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> website.
Now, however, U:fon serves as an argument for not admitting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová said: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
Due to this approach of mobile operators, however, the Czech regulatory authorities are completely uninterested.
It is not just about the position of the CTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere with competition.
They belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential candidates was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristián Chalupa from the Department of Foreign Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS in response to our question.
It is not surprising that such a statement was made by the representatives of the operators.
From an authority to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market, this is more than respected.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "At a foreign country where virtual operators are commonly active, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction of prices for mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are clearly not in the interests of the EHS.
In fact, shocking to the whole case is the touching convergence of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is offered entirely on its own.
Just like the exact same price of gasoline at gas stations, it is certainly just a piece of chance and a fierce competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence of anti-competitive conduct in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have a correspondingly increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to be available to the telecommunications regulator as well," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of a dominant position in the market is one of many points of dispute.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets carried out by the CFU, according to which telecommunications are the sole market from the point of view of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a certain segment, it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning to <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that the three mobile operators are acting in a similar way.
However, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
Responsibility-building at CTU is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS gives a hand away from the whole matter.
We’ve met him on several similar occasions.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the powers of the CTBT to the field of competition in telecommunications failed to enforce, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
This must be known more than well by the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one's looking
However, the operation of some pseudo-virtual operators remains unnoticed, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
This is usually done by a multi-level marketing company.
Own mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The prices of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders large quantities of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, you will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a breach of the terms of the contract that we would deal with and could lead to the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová said.
However, it is quite unlikely that such activity would not affect the responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, they can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is preventing such a procedure.
In fact, they have considerable profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out possible problems: “The law allows for similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers uses the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not kept in their name, so they cannot dispose of it fully as regular customers of mobile operators."
This is what should be at least odd.
In addition, another question is being opened for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators are closing their eyes to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the EPA has relatively strong powers to detect a similar activity and, if it does not wish to do so, may not be satisfied with an explanation by operators that they have no idea of such a thing and their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in prices for services.
In practically all countries where virtual operators originated, classical operators tried to more or less prevent their emergence.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, or perhaps too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, it was at this moment that regulators intervened, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and another was loaded onto it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case away like hot potatoes.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in competences is more than suitable for them in these cases.
But let's not throw the flint into the rye.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will appear with us really soon, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If any of the operators has admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling the railroad than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented new recordings of the national anthem Kde domj<0xC3><0xBD>.
The anthem was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávk.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choir service and instrumental version.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka started singing.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices, which are prominent and popular, for singing solo variations.
"From the beginning, I tried to see to both of them, and then also to the choir, that they had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they agreed," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home was first sung in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovsk<0xC3><0xBD> Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for their own.
After the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first song became a natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" anthem sound like?
Prague Highway on Wednesday for the first time on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be inscribed in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will enter the metro, tram and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it can take about one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and yearly coupon (this will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have it uploaded to their chip card in the infocenters and workplaces of the Transport Company in the subway stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobyly.
Coupons can also be purchased from yesterday via the Internet on the Transport Company’s website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers by the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget the window in the subway stations, where they have had to regularly stand in long queues for paper tickets.
The coupon will be purchased over the Internet and uploaded to the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"At these places, passengers have access to a service desk with trained staff, which will help them with online purchases and also upload the purchased coupon to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to the Opencard also in self-service vending machines, which are installed in several halls of the metro.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, the ticket markers remind and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations of Roztyla, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," he added.
Coupon will check the driver's location of the vending machine
The operation of the vending machines that will start to work tomorrow is simple.
Simply insert an Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it itself.
Electronic vouchers from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, mainly residents of central Bohemia municipalities travel to the capital.
"In the trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they can determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which compiles the timetables of the Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver’s box.
When embarking, it is necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the treasury.
This will allow the driver to check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the suburban buses and do not remember when their voucher expires may return to the self-service vending machines where the vouchers are uploaded to the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudetes wanted a US referendum.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded the incorporation of the Forest into the United States.
This is the result of a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudanese Germans reportedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is apparent, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter from the US president not to allow the return of the "Shumava County" - seized by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure in words that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter, signed with the words “People who have the fate of the Forest at their heart,” reads.
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia gives the Sudeten Germans – in the knowledge of the Czech national character – only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the US president ask that the protectorate over Shumavou take over for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would have given this territory to a foreign state that is oppressing and rejecting minorities and nothing, nothing at all, contributed to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly fear of the revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president allegedly doubted the views of the Schumacher Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Schumacher county on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the U.S. or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some memorials, it appropriately outlines the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to have at least guessed that it would be their departure from the republic, few of them admitted such an option at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a certain kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was deployed to the Baltic navy during the war as a Budweiser German.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, the Czech language would be useful to them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of the decrees of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional Campaign to Attack Drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Still, one could characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office promises to discourage drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on TV, radio, movies, the Internet, and leaflets.
It should discourage the driver from driving fast and drinking alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to tie themselves up before they leave.
It wants to reach the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Mostly human stories that attack the emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "you don't think" is written in capital letters on the inscription.
And in the pot of blood, there's the word "you'll pay."
This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his own life.
Viewers will be "scared" by the spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic images of the victims of accidents can commonly be seen.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The system of sugar and whips applies to the driver.
Sugar for them is that when they go on red, for example, it saves time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Na Homolce Hospital Traffic Psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
And that is why we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, says the psychologist.
He said the signs are already less effective, alerting the driver to the danger.
"If a static warning sign is installed, it will probably soon merge with the surrounding area and the drivers will not dedicate themselves to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published in the Jediot Achronot newspaper on Monday.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will have to return almost all, if not all, of the occupied territories," Olmert told the daily.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage [of the territory of Israel], because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem as well.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his feet, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites", which lies inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work," he added.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for a peace deal with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to win the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to give up the sustained support they provide to terrorism (the Shia movement) of Hamas, (the terrorist networks) of al-Qaeda, and jihad (the holy war).
Question after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arose whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while driving.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in which a 22-year-old stewardess died last week, appears to have been caused by the driver of a truck crossing the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, even though two more seats were reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the technical pass.
If not approved on the bus, passengers must sit.
The Student Agency buses do not have a place to stand; this was confirmed by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"We have dealt with this with the Ministry and at first the movement of passengers did not allow.
Afterwards, it was cancelled and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat," he said.
The steward's law is not known.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term ‘guiding vehicle’; it does not define its rights and obligations,” Hanzelka adds.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operations of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the issue is adequately addressed by the law.
"It depends on whether the bus has parking spaces allowed in the approval.
That's how it ends," he says.
The buses are divided into urban ones with standing places and limited maximum speed, intercity ones with standing places with higher permitted speed, and long distance ones without standing places with the highest permitted speed, and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the airplane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín does not see a major problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"With a smooth ride, there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service in aircraft.
It’s unclear when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant may hit her head.”
"But if the bus stops sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be dealt with by the carrier with internal regulations," he says and also believes that the issue is unresolved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But once I get the impression that the stewards' profession is risky, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be taken by passengers on board.
It would also save costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in his cars was justified by the director of Asiana, Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to the SA.
"We don't have a stewardess, we've been against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal injury," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There has been an immense tragedy
A young stewardess from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, died in the accident of a line connection to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably drifted off the lane without using a stop sign and blocked the bus’s path.
His driver tried to avoid the sharp maneuver, but missed him with the right front.
That two seats reserved for the stewards' rest would be sold out, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses.
"These places cannot be booked on long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the courthouse, but also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Amendment of the law?
Unseen
Specifying the movement of stewards on board the bus could be brought about by an amendment to the law, on which the thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport works for over a year.
“There was no concrete conclusion, however.
The buses do not even deal with much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone when driving," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be a significant threat to the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes, saying that the control of the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt.
The big words in the letter from the WestLB board of directors to the employees of this bank are not lacking.
By merging the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank, "the central institution of the financial group of savers for trading in the capital markets" will be created.
According to the letter to this transaction, WestLB will introduce a "set of competences" to ensure long-term returns.
In any case, such a merger can be a decisive impetus for further mergers in the country’s banking sector.
Such texts are created when the board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose message to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which customers of savings banks know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Franz Waas, CEO of Deka-Bank, made it clear at the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of his Mainzer Landstraße banking house with some of the country’s banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which consists of one half of the Land Bank and the other half of the Savings Bank, has mandated the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about trading on the capital market or part of it.
The talks have only just begun, the finance ministers said.
It is not the first time that Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, has been mentioned in the context of consolidation in the savings sector, as it is one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt.
In 2003, it seemed that there could be a merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
In the end, there was nothing of this trinity.
Shortly after the merger’s plans were made public, the Hesse state government spoke out against Helaba’s participation.
Neither of the other two banks were connected.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, there has been repeated speculation about the merger of Deka-Bank with the land banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, has expressed a negative opinion about speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
However, he seems to be convinced independently that the rapprochement of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Landtag in Bavaria, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to start drawing up the connection.
That's not very good news for Helab.
If the pressure on further mergers is to increase, the potential partners for such mergers are gradually lost.
In the south, only the second violin would play, despite the fact that the financial crisis so far faces significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The connection with WestLB was again banned at the beginning of the year by the Hessen-Thüringer Sveriges Spo<0xC5><0x99>itelen and the Jury Banks, which holds an eighty-five per cent stake in Helab.
At the very least, Nord LB would be considered.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions fit together.
In June, Merl said that the German Savings Union and peer banks had not yet answered the crucial question of which business model should ensure the future competitiveness of land banks.
It could also end up with the WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That’s why the letter from the board of directors also talks about trying to find a “comprehensive solution” for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual files with Deka-Bank will show the time.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with Italy"
It's Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena will be his girlfriend, so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest proves how deep tones can emit his throat.
Elena kisses Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" will leave this evening at 23.45, expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, in one bus only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And so loudly, says Marco Guarda, it’s nothing for Italy.
The three buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat with a fur lining and glasses with wide silver girdles.
He has been travelling with them to the Oktoberfest for five years, only this year he has organized three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 22.30 departure back.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros including a welcome drink with Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian law on beer purity, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus stops quickly, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing well, they'll still need their strength.
It is built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the highway number 8 just in front of Munich, many other buses with an Italian license plate also pause.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at a parking lot near Theresienwies at mid-seven in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has a final speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First, put on a yellow cap.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest" in Swabian, next to Marco's web address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" cried Marco in the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, not to hinder, and not all the yellow caps on the same bench, spread out around the space!"
The maz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that we're behaving decently.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third: "Tonight, at exactly half past eleven, be here again!" Do you understand?
And up on Wiesn, a place with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as marks on trees, signposts and even on the election poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
The "weekend with Italy" is known as the second weekend of the Oktoberfest.
Accurate data on the number of visitors are not available; there is talk of fifty thousand who go on a journey through the Alps and fall into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend said to have arrived from Italy.
The ranks of the Munich police will be strengthened by seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains national statistics in which Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
The Hofbräu tent is particularly popular among Italians.
Dreamless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is a good thing that this politician used the word "relatively" and involved the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis.
Because it's the one about last weekend.
With the Dax index, a financial house specializing in the financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a multi-billion dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance would go up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Interest will only be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from the actual amount exhausted.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, this government financer had refinanced the long-term projects for which he had lent money for an extremely short period of time, which is no longer possible because of the mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank’s reserves shrank by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and its equity share decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Regular earnings and net earnings from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, earnings from increased debt and certain securities, as well as from the abolition of credit trading reserves, fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only the higher returns on compensation for the subsequent settlement costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and on interest reimbursement under the tax code and on trade facilitation for group companies were still moderate in the sixteen per cent decrease in revenue.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financer burned on mortgages for businessmen, which were then separated from the service portfolio and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Since traditional public funding earned too little, Depfa became more heavily involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write something down, and these write-offs will have a "critical material effect" on calculating the profits and losses of the entire group, as some have been uncertainly told.
The fact is, there will be no dividends.
In 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financer of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depf.
More strongly than other institutions, they rely on refinancing in the interbank market because they have no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up because the banks keep their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds annually for part of Depf’s loan portfolio – around 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group are covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets at the moment to a considerable extent incompetent function".
Other sources have indicated that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to take advantage of the money markets in the near future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group in the market is now secured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors are hoping for.
But given the dynamics and incomprehensibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan should not be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank apparently stood before insolvency on Sunday afternoon, it cannot, even if preliminary, save the passion.
The stock price fell by 75 percent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.30.
On the contrary, the bond exchange rates were holding well.
While preferential debts have practically not moved, secondary bond rates are losing more significantly.
This relates in particular to the bond of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and, logically, to the bond with maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood depending on the stability of the international financial system after a sharp sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which introduced it into the company by taking over Depf.
As long as issuing banks, governments and less-affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to expect the repayment of securities within their maturity.
But there may also be something that hardly anyone dares to hope for now - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalisation, there is now no more than legitimate hope from the probability that borders with certainty.
This is especially likely to prepare long-term creditors for a series of wakeful nights when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors can use the threshold at least to generate a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange rate returns in later years for the purpose of future payment of capital income tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of bento boxes
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop introduces herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls begin to sneak around: that German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the manga. On her new blog about the exchange stay she tells about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was so excited on my way to school.
I live in the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I drive 40 minutes by train to the high school in Tachibana.
I had to find my way alone, thankfully I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not given as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after eight o’clock and twenty minutes before nine begins a short session with the teacher, the so-called ‘home room’.
But before the lesson began, I had to introduce myself.
I am not the type of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I wore my host mom’s old skirt, plus a blouse, blue slippers and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sajónara Wo <0xC5><0xA1> Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At that point, I was very happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, chirping and waving, and I kept hearing the word ‘kawaii’.
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I swiftly entered my place.
The girl next to me smiled broadly, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I literally fell asleep.
They were talking to each other and they were chirping and asking me about the possible and the impossible – and yet it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their bags.
My host mom also made me such a box for lunch - and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small dumplings, cucumber and almond salad, fruit and some fish in tofu dough.
I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
These things look odd and taste quite new.
The thing is, everything's really good.
Well, maybe except for salt-laden plums, br!
Benta in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that the girl gives the boy a hand-made bento, which in this case is especially artistic, and hopes to get to know the boy closer during a snack on the break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm wondering if I'll see it here, too.
‘Why Japan?’ my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Cause I'm just fascinated.'
After all, I have been reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning a little Japanese one day.
It was clear to me that I would have to come here someday.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and habits.
And they are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
When a rat or cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals also have feelings.
But how could it be verified that they feel the same when they behave in the same way as we do?
The online journal "Edge" has been publishing contributions of well-known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to engage in a different kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we step into the rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it will do the same thing as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
Humans behave similarly, of which some scientists assume a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
This is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share of short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in humans than in other primates, and appears to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that a person is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be concealed by the linguistic essence of man: because so much of his perception is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if consciousness did not matter to language, surely language would influence it, so that animal consciousness, however constructed it may be, would probably differ from most states of consciousness of ours.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what the consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not possible to measure or, because of special hardware, to analyze it on the basis of our own experience, its examination puts us before great problems.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but besides that there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically more accessible.
It would be possible to study the processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, which was approached by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but perhaps they are not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does it mean for feelings?
I deduce them from the fact that an emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) utilizes operational memory.
Seen from this angle, the feelings are closely linked to those areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In connection with linguistic nature, there is a subtle gradation of perception, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states, so that we can attribute them to others next to ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and brain stem devoted to physical sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could safely participate in the feelings perceived by several animal genera.
I cannot, theoretically, oppose this, but I consider it to be unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what we see as fear in rats and humans probably feels the same way about both organisms: But how can it be verified that rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he feel fear?
In my view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the similarity of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, while cockroaches do not have a brain.
But is the brain strain responsible for the feelings?
And even if it could be proven in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I’d rather explore emotional behavior than the emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and in humans.
Like a rat, I don't study language and consciousness, I don't study feelings, because I don't know if they exist.
It may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: The grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said the preparations would soon be led directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a testament to its confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the World Cup together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the early implementation of the schedule for the construction or rebuilding of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts stumble.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said the president of the Ukrainian Union, Grigori Surkis.
"Uefa will be watching us all the time.
An even more radical move has been agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was removed by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The Committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this step will not lead to preparations for the 2012 World Cup."
Several first-league teams were only condemned to a forced downturn because of manipulations last season, eventually even having to move the start of the league quickly.
Angry Dennis Quaid returns
She wanted to make an ad for a new movie, she talked in an interview about private things – and now she’s having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
He's furious and kicking back.
The Delayed War of the Roses by ex-married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors lead a nasty fight in front of the public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan said: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
It was only after the divorce that she learned about the extent of the fraud.
The inspiration for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: "It's crazy," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly chews the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
In addition, it is "sorry" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack once again "publicly recalls the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become a father to twins.
He concludes his reflections on circumvention: “My life goes on anyway.
I think I’m lucky to have a wonderful family that’s doing great.”
Prices of flights and hotels are falling.
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights were up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and hotel accommodation have again been discounted - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its data on bookings made in the first half of 2008 and, after the price increase in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation has already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than the previous year.
American Express considers the weak dollar exchange rate to be the cause of this trend, which has caused “the decreasing appetite of American tourists to travel”.
The decline in hotel prices has also hit financial centers more severely than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent to a European record.
In the first quarter of the year, airfares also showed an upward trend:
Due to the cost of kerosene, passengers in the Economy Class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while long-haul flights cost up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of Economy-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the changes were less noticeable in the Business and First-Class classes.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they increased by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
In German national flights, according to the study cited, prices fell by even half.
One of the reasons for this price fall is the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the aviation market is uncertain.
On the other hand, due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the disruption of unprofitable airlines and also the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - there were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to a single bar and simple methods, the Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to build a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - Enlarge Failed Landing for Representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach got into the game until late and failed with a punched balloon on the pole.
His message was accurately formulated and sounded convincingly out of his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much was done in the catacombs, the break between halftimes was over, and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many instant actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol attracted and raised his thumb at the sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order was probably similar: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"It wasn't all nice looking around here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it to be more relaxed.
For 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers owe the header Mladen Petri<0xC4><0x87> (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladba<0xC5><0xA1>anes could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
So on Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a live updated table on the video wall, in which their team was featured as a prize winner.
It'll be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suggests that the continuous table result symbolizes the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Nevese and Silva, the goalkeeper Petri<0xC4><0x87> and the FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly found, but still can not flash.
"We need more emotion and more dribbling," Jol said.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to fall by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in a day in his history.
Later, Dow picked up something again.
At around 8:30 p.m., this world’s most important stock market barometer showed a five percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was down more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The worst of this was in Dow at this point, the American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
None of the titles have been strengthened.
The shares of Goldman Sachs have lost nearly 10 percent.
A few days ago, the company was owned by the great investor Warren Buffett.
As part of the bailout plan, funds should be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is expected to receive stock options lists of financial companies, which could be repaid in the event of a favorable development of the exchange rate, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling steeply
Billionaire aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not dispel doubts.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly declining and the Dax index is withdrawing.
The Dow Jones Index is losing despite the government’s planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular exchange losses from Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep down.
The shares of the aforementioned Munich real estate financer lost up to three-quarters of their value despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important limit of 6,000 points, with a minus of 3.7 percent, scoring 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, the Wall Street trading day began with significant losses.
Investors fear the U.S. government’s $700 billion bailout may not be enough to rebuild financial markets.
In the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on the rescue plan, with the Senate likely to speak on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges were heading in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, while in Paris, the CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei Index declined by 1.26% to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell from 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and trade ended at 12,595.75.
Arcandor's shares were lost in the MDAx following the announcement of an increase in the share capital.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism group has also announced that it will not sell its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
Scientists have been unaware of one mysterious phenomenon for years: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space.
Because of the fuel pipelines, which will soon freeze, she is now at risk of dying from the cold.
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists - the anomaly of gravitational pole.
A gravitational beam is an aerial maneuver of space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what the scientist has been stating for years in this case is astonishing: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect according to the old good law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized with an anomaly of gravitational pole.
Several experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not mistaken, and is trying to explain the gravitational pull anomaly using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in space has been detected by astronomers.
"The cause of this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about a decade.
It is apparently based on gravitational force, the effect of which on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
Scientists estimate that this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists are free in Egypt
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the Italian Foreign Minister, tourists are kidnapped in Egypt again in freedom.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
It was reported that six kidnappers were killed in the pre-release shooting.
Five Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the targets of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists drawn to the Sahara seem to be free.
The same was reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabia, and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports by Italian TV station Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're checking their health," Frattini said.
According to an Egyptian state television report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the desert expedition are reportedly already on their way to Cairo.
Unclear remains the background to the shooting before the release of the hostages: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," said the quoted worker.
He said it was "just about taking the hostage" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, capturing two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to one of the German mediators, said the release of the hostages was prolonged because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostage after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of the father "has led to suicide"
Several years of father-in-law abuse led a woman to commit suicide, the court heard.
After confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment, seventy-seven-year-old Michael Trerise of the Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle was regularly tied up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
In court, it was also said that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court heard that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was haunted by a ghost of abuse committed against her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006, friends of Ms. Randle, who was also very involved in surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and "gave up life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have suffocated with a needle bag.
Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with: "I bound her and bound her eyes.
“I didn’t abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
“This awkward story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more awful is the fact that if she hadn't done so, the case would probably not have gone to court at all."
“I would particularly like to stress the consequences that Stephanie’s parents have had on their daughter over the years,” he added.
"Obviously, she'd probably be a promising, successful, happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left strictly classified documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man left two strictly secret documents on the train at Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Department of Defense.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the aforementioned law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
The BBC's defense correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising to many in Whitehall.
“They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the government office,” he said.
An employee who is not allowed to be appointed is charged under section 8.1 of the applicable law, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police prosecute the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analyses of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an unknown location.
Cooperative back-ups face B&B debt
British cooperative back-ups may have to deal with more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million in debt after saving Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative-based ones.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Cooperative Foundations Association (BSA), said it was "humiliating" that the reserves and their members must pay.
Fourteen billion dollars of debt will eventually be repaid by saving Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that is accruing in the meantime will be paid each year to all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Fund for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 cooperatives are included in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions, who have acted prudently... now have to pay the bills of those institutions, which were far from so prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that back-ups should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will increase in 2009 to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
That means backers will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay first-year interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the cooperative trade association, told the BBC that he was convinced it was not fair.
“It’s humiliating that those institutions that acted judiciously during the housing market boom now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from judicious.”
According to the BSA, no backups have fallen since 1945, when they appeared.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what options are available to protect the cooperative back-ups and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole said.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010 there will be interest payments for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative reserves are joint-stock organizations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk costs five pence per liter
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy Company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is already the second price increase this year, after the two-money auction in February, and comes after research conducted by a consultancy firm.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want the auctions to reflect in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi Prime Minister Rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request for the release of former Prime Minister Shaykh Hasina Wajid on bail, meaning that if she returns home, she can be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the allegation that she had obtained more than $50 million from a certain businessman by extortion when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption allegations brought against her.
Khalid Zija, a longtime political rival of Shaykh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local army-held government first give her complete freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was released on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is unclear under the terms of her release whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she is now appealing to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court order.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request by saying that she does not need bail when she is already undergoing an investigation released for a statement of honor abroad," her lawyer, Rafique-ul Huq, said in a statement.
"We will appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail so she could return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Shaykh Hasina is due to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after an army-held interim government seized power, but was released from prison in June so she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khalid Ziyah both deny all the accusations against each other.
Fear of vaccination against polio in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children have not taken part in the recent measles vaccination because of violence associated with the Taliban.
The U.N. has vaccinated six provinces in the past week.
However, she says she could not get to the children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said that despite the promises of the Taliban, it would not attack or prevent thousands of vaccinated workers from working.
BSkyB loses court dispute over ITV
BSkyB has lost a legal dispute over the review of the Commission’s competition decision ordering the company to reduce its share in the competitive broadcasting company ITV.
The Court of Appeal for Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % to less than 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s share was damaging the competition and giving the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB's share was bought in 2006 in a store which as a result prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Sir Richard Branson, head of the Virgin consortium, consumer organizations and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution – primarily because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The move came in a situation where a report on the affair prepared by the High Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, the lawmaker and former Justice Minister Alberto Gonzalez.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators in order to erase justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: “Major allegations, including potential criminal acts, have not been fully investigated or explained.”
The appointment of a Special Prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. lawyers of their duties in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers had been released because of poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the dismissal of lawyers was not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter deception brought against the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are investigating and prosecuting in government court cases.
They may be released at any time, but they may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was fired for his dismissal and eventually resigned.
A number of other officials from the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Gonzales’ role in the affair, saying that he was “mainly responsible” for his dismissal, that he “abdicated” from his leadership position and that he was “notably not involved in the affair.”
Other officials, including former Bush senior adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf receives one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will come to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold award, said he was "honored" by the accolade.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year’s nominations are led by Coldplay, which has been selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand over things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with the instrumental part, which lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at number 15.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell has been in the charts for about nine years and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 was operated on for irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Dark streets, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other ground transportation, some famous, others only useful.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and long-time locals find it difficult to find Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village neighborhood and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic stroke.
There's no sign with street names.
In an ordinary atlas, it is virtually invisible.
Still, the street has admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to pave the way for a cleaner passageway to stores and boutiques to open in new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last remnants of the time the block was refined.
However, the City Authority for the Protection and Development of Buildings, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the municipal community land committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay company drew up a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of Community 3, the committee prefers such a variant when the street remains in the hands of the city, and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
"Proposals could be made for repair and management, which Avalon could do, but we also want to ensure public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to rebuild a small street and set up seating areas, several of which would be used by a cafe whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first announced at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to take advantage of the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
“The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this deserted alley and make it a beautiful place for the public,” she said, adding that the sale was designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Construction Preservation Authority, said the city really wanted to sell the street, pointing out that his office’s job was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
To the Extra Place led the back door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is perhaps best known as the background photo on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
“The place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about refining the East Village neighborhood, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and argue that that piece of public property, though modest, should remain public.
Others consider the Extra Place a rarity – an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on behalf of Jeremiah's disappearing New York (subtitled "The Book of Mourning: A Bitterly Nostalgic View of the City in the Process of Extinction"), hung up a part of the Extra Place story from the section Talking about the City, which appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The article's author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind alley, dark even in the daytime and bounded by the slashed iron doors of warehouses and smashed windows, where a week old newspaper is chased in the stubble."
With a few exceptions, the alley on one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat crossed the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where an expensive clothing store stands today.
There were graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh dose of discarded newspapers was an empty bottle of beer.
A few passers-by said that he rarely thinks of Extra Place, but suggested that some spring might be useful to him.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thinks some people underestimate the street’s impressiveness in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have been in dark, wet, and disgusting places."
Debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this edition of Focused on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Worst than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools.”
Effectively addressing Hispanic voters is a daunting matter.
Barack Obama’s educational agenda only proves this.
Obama’s campaign notes that “African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
In order to combat such performance gaps, Obama’s educational agenda advocates especially, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for those who are just learning English.
The question for Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is no stronger than his interest in reducing performance gaps.
Consider, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in the eastern Los Angeles district.
Students of this school are, in the vast majority of cases, Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Nevertheless, in the state tests in mathematics in 2008, the highest level of incredible one hundred percent of fourth graders.
Almost equally amazing ninety-three percent of fourth graders reached the highest level in the state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities, and unprecedented access.
Furthermore, and this should be noted by Obama, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s pedagogical approach to those who are just learning English is “complete immersion.”
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, said to me: "We had a tremendous success with one brand new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would go into class and not know what it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a role model for what other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English learners should look like?
The results achieved by the school should be self-evident in answering this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Educational Association is a longstanding proponent of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education are blurred.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he stated that people should stop worrying about “English only” laws.
Instead, “you should make sure your children speak Spanish,” he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance gaps, he should think carefully about educational patterns that work, rather than ridicule and trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply due to renewed economic worries
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even a U.S. plan to save financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
The price of futures oil trades fell in the morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange by up to 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than twenty dollars a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial turmoil on Wall Street as well as a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices dropped to almost $90 a barrel earlier this month, jumping to a surge of huge financial market uncertainties.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the Congressional Presidency announced that it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the biggest bailout plan in history.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the advancing decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy the banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the furious weekend talks that led to the plan to save the economy "are showing themselves unable to revive the market mood."
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for global stock markets, interest rates and foreign exchange rates has severely weakened," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread to the whole world and especially to China.”
Analysts have narrowed their expectations for next year as oil consumption has fallen due to slower economic growth, and have cut their 2009 gasoline price forecasts by about 20%.
The wild ride in the second quarter broke the team's record.
After spending more time in the Jets than anyone else in the last eight seasons, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a sleepy ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals settled down with their grieving game.
Quarterback Brett Favre then sent Laveranuese Colese to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly marking an afternoon in which their progressive collaboration moved one mile ahead.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter behind another two touchdowns, including the one in which he fell cornerback, and another 10 seconds before the half of the game.
"It wasn't anything special," Favre told Coles of all his compliments.
“He’s a damn good player.
We communicated well, no matter what people might think.”
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a missed shot and returned it 32 yards on the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith typed another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens gave Warner a shot.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals reached the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets won the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a twenty-yard goal off the field, earning a lead of 34-0.
That's the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "A second quarter, or a third quarter?"
When he was told that the Jets allowed 21 points without a response in the third quarter, Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
There were a lot of points in a short period of time.”
Rested Gebreselassie improves his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under two hours and four minutes.
With a win on a pleasantly flat track in 2:03:59, he surpassed his previous time of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is really incredibly wide – he has broken the world record or is at least the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he feared — perhaps too frightened from a retrospective — that polluted air would irritate his problems with asthma.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - he won the Gebreselassie on Sunday with a lightning fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on the longer track, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a calf spasm two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The pause, of course, aroused him rather than held him back.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little doubtful today, but everything was fine.”
He was also criticized—especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival—for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon gimmicks, relying on drivers as if it were a race on track, and setting world records above his sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running qualities.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselassie half in time 1:02:04.
After the drivers dropped out, Gebreselassie was continually chased by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little over three miles ahead of Gebreselassie's goal, he last took and ran away from Kwambaio, who then finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, she finished the excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19 Irina Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nková, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany.
The record time is 2:15:25 with Paula Radcliff from the UK.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nková surprisingly won last spring in the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She skipped the Beijing Games because of what was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal maximum by nearly five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan cross-country skiers flee into a big lead and then pulled them for about 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya finished third in time 2:25:01.
Pride and Barriers to the Lives of Blacks in a Separate City
Hidden amongst the sprawling amusement parks of greater Orlando, a few miles away from everything shiny, noisy and revolving, lies a quiet city where the pride and hardship of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, three hundred good swimmers."
It is now a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville festival Zora! to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains aside, even though she made it a tourist stop by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It’s still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and didn’t share their real feelings with a white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t even know what he’s missing.”
Even today, in a year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open debate on races, many people here remain cautious of foreign views.
“We pay close attention to how our story is told,” says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of black rise and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is double the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also an oak-shaded example of southern rural black culture – sometimes despised, sometimes praised – that emerged from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the locals are both proud and protective.
And the worries about Eatonville really only started with the Dawn, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of accents such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide transformed the city a bit into Highway 17, which leads through the often overlooked downtown of Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With a big drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white-brown decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits in an hour-long hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
This was obviously not the typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chip malfunctioner who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time when she arrived in the city, she arrived without warning in the huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in the city, which is still proud of its dignified clothing.
Most of the inhabitants were fascinated, Franklin said, but many grumbled.
"The people of Dawn have always loved to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were taken out of print.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten about her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
“I don’t think they understood its significance to the world or its legacy at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston’s 2003 biography Wrapped in Rainbows.
The change came in the 80s of the 20th century.
Representatives of Orange County wanted to extend the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-lane main road.
The departure of Orlando has already pushed the interstate highway No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the fifties of the 20th century, the struggle to mix races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came in and threw oranges and stuff at the people who were sitting on the sidelines," Franklin said.
“In fact, there was a woman who was killed.
They threw melons out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court’s demand for forced integration and declared his ruling in the Brown v. Chamber of Education case to be “offensive to my race rather than commendable.”
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
“Black kids were used to hugging — I remember that — you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It took until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not embracing your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who like her have risen above prejudices with reckless self-confidence and quotes like "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand that."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, the acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, who reintroduced her to the American canon, came to the shelves in bookshops.
The project with the highway arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found the lights of the ramp.
The former Hurston neighbors now considered her a saviour.
To show what could happen to its highway to destroy, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived for the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to celebrate.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"These five streams of the highway have been resurrected, you would say, a direct burst, a real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply, "The dawn saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image of the city.
Outsiders such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the local church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes seem like a dead end in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
With strangers coming in search of the story and meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required in advance and certain things - such as murals in the oldest Eatonville church, painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a courageous, self-assured teacher who likes red satiety, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And as the Hurston Festival grew, so did the domestic pride.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, eighteen-year-old Edwin Harvey, a sincere love for the village echoes as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, which he says would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they're just passing by, think, 'Hmm, this town is nothing against the others,'" said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all fluent in finance.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newspaper stalls and expansive TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the glassy hive of offices above their heads, every day, the bankers and fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst “bad day in the office” since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still roaring metal trolleys along the sidewalks and transporting muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
The Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, fifty iron shirts hanging from the vaults on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in the queue for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn’t seem like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had timed this task to cover up with a late-afternoon siesta at my local branch, JP Morgan Chase, there were already about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of the cash desks to pick up or store cash, but in front of the counter, where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for a trip to Macy's mixed goods store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason as me.
However, compared to me, they have already picked up their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They have collected money from so-called thrifts (a bit like construction savings banks), monetary associations and those types of savings banks whose branches operate only in one state and which claim to care for their customers as a family.
Over the past year, 15 such banks have quietly collapsed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and when New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, the Wachovs, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch a bailout buyer.
The employees of the offices and shops that stood in front of me and feared another collapse, moved their cash to the bank, which is perceived as a safe harbor and which does most of the bailout on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent finances in the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket was on the phone talking to Lehman Bordhers, that bank that had collapsed, and to her slim-down senior executive Dick Fuld, with such familiarity, as if she were talking about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed 50-year-old housewife of my little one, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation -- Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, “I have my savings in money market funds now.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Moslem tombs desecrated after Austria's right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left, from the Austrian right-wing Free People's Party and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang are participating in the demonstration, which presented the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed by a red line.
Police are accusing right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
Over 90 graves at the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were sometimes severely damaged between Friday evening and this morning and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits sprinkled Jewish symbols on some of the graves, such as the Star of David, but detectives believe it could have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shocked” by the news of the desecration coming as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan nears its end.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering the cycle of searching for its own soul after the right wing blew up in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which combined won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free and Union for the Future of Austria, campaigned vehemently against immigration and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Free Party, which won more than 18 percent of the vote, protested against scarves and burqas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam.
At the last meeting with the electorate in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which placed the extreme right in the position of the country’s strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was caused primarily by young voters worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glamorous star who has been convicted of sexually abusing children, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kentucky police approved the ban last Thursday after it handed over evidence of Glitter's past convictions for sexual abuse of children to officials.
Glitter, in his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's Lowest Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the judiciary said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Lowest Criminal Court, the Kentian police requested a decree that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadda from crossing the border into France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd did not attend in person.
The 64-year-old Glitter told authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, as recorded in the sex offenders register.
They must notify the authorities if they want to travel abroad for more than three days.
They also have to report the planned departure date to the police one week in advance.
If he fails to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible journeys through the county.
A spokeswoman for the Kent police said: “The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who stays in the UK, because we have extensive systems that manage the potential danger more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kentian police, and we are working hard to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders to minimise any danger to the public.”
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to embark on a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there, while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order requiring him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the UK for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source in the interior ministry said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was calm and happy that Glitter had been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master off-scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no bells, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, disconnected from the focus on interpretation - only in this way do I achieve a relaxed expression of man or woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
Secondly, a man.
Inseparable, not to mention privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then you can see a familiar gesture, the depth of a glimpsed gaze or a passionate gesture of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to get on stage.
In "Flamenco-people", German Günther Bauer alternates the theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which runs as part of the Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca) program, "reflects the ever-growing international importance of flamenco," the author says, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the photos, you find that it is not typical.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and completely captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to photograph on stage.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the giants of flamenco.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997 to portray flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classical photography.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the image and gives it a contemporary spirit, which is an idea that, according to Bauer himself, also reflects flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which, however, does not cease to surprise and evolve."
What strikes the viewers is not the effect of the dance, singing or play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet with the most essential, with that spirit that manifests itself in the way of perception, being and experiencing, that has been and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery of El Fotómata.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists is shaped by famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon have a book edition containing portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer’s passion for portraiture led him to repeat the idea on the “Portraits of Sports Veterans” (“SportARTproject”).
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "photographing people, recognizing them and being able for a moment, whether long or short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
A person meets or confronts people, personalities he sometimes doesn’t even know, or gives him only a few minutes to shoot.
Despite such circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery on the 20th Street, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa has admitted that the novel he writes is "courage"
Set in an environment unknown to him yet, Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel, the main hero of which is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo and traveled to the Amazon for twenty years.
The Nobel laureate for literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is currently employing him "is daring", and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
“If I were smart, I wouldn’t do it, but I’ll do it, and I believe I’ll finish it one day,” he concluded at a festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts, and words that saw an aqueduct in the city in four days around hundreds of writers, historians, and journalists, and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "The City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - Dickens's old edition of "Our mutual friend" - filled Juan Bravo's theater to the last place.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, he had before him the texts of the poet and the audience of the poet, to whom the hour of time passed like water; the Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a noteworthy dose of humor, he remembered how he lived in him from the original "incredible adventure" of the "pleasure of the passionate reader" of the poem.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way out of self-selection" to find out whether and to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is merely a fun, fleeting experience" - Vargas Llosa emphasized that "there is no way out of self-selection" to find out if and to what extent books can change lives.
Due to climatology, the festival in Pozoblanc loses - lacking a spear
The performance with the spears, which concludes the ceremony in Pozoblanc, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
Therefore, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pable Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the company decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavorable weather conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfights.
During them, the formations José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to stand up to the bulls in the arena in Castilblanco.
This was only celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically quality performance was carried on his shoulder.
On the same day in the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two lances for greetings and one ear, which brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than toreador art.
Even worse was El Julio, who walked through the bull arena of Los Llanos unsalted fat.
In the second round of work without a single respite, he earned sharp criticism from the majority of the public.
They took control in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a truck with two thousand kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes, five.
Road control Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The officers stop two people driving in the van and they run away from them.
The cost, more than two tons of hashish, is unstoppable.
According to a report by the Interior Committee of the Basque Government, they were pursued and detained by one of the people riding in the van, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and forging state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transportation Unit were conducting a road check on the N-1 at points where it crosses the border of the city of Armiñón.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver did not obey the instructions, accelerated sharply and ran away.
The car began to chase immediately, when the vehicle stopped at the edge a few kilometers away, at which point both passengers jumped up and fled to the woodland.
Ertzaintza eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were carrying, as it turned out during an inspection of the Iveco Daily delivery.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were then transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark is "stained" and does not agree with the data provided in the documents of the delivery, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaitza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to flee in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28, was transferred to the police department for proper formalities before proceeding with further investigation later on.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Drug Influence
Actress Heather Locklear, the favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her conducting unusual maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California highway patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m. Locklear “stroke hard on the gas, rushed forward and backward in a loud roar, and tried to get out of the parking lot – she crossed her sunglasses several times while walking backwards.”
The witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear a moment after stopping on the nearby highway and getting off the vehicle.
The person also alerted the rescue service because "he was afraid for Locklear's life."
When the police arrived at the scene, she found the actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
She “looked disoriented,” so the officials took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actress was cooperating and excessive amounts of alcohol were soon excluded, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medications, which was apparent to the officers at first sight."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of the effects of a near unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released several hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a medical clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Association IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The head of the IU and MP for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of the former councillor of the Youth and Sports Department of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after he was accused of being associated with the party in favor of his family.
"I'm too federalist to do that, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares said in a speech the party will have to move forward with respect to a former member of the Sevilla City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that in the case of an investigation into the illegal act that Silva has committed, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "The IU has always fought to ensure that such matters are as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Blood of May" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garci's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "Blood of May" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by the episodes from the national past of Benito Pérez Galdós, revives the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "depict the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paulo Echevarría during the presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of performers.
May’s two-and-a-half-hour blood will be released in theaters this Friday, and more than a four-hour TV series for Telemadrid is set to air in the future.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós, José Luis Garci claims that the filming of this film has fulfilled a "children's dream", thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to film the film for the Autonomous Province of Madrid.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid has fully contributed, means for García a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with backdrops and costumes corresponding to the image of "the shaking of Spain, which was mistaken in the leader, the leader of which went to fight - the fight for the VII.
But the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support that has been given to the movies The Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goy's Ghosts - almost twice as much as May Blood -, so he could not film some scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horacio Valcárcel, the entire film being written by Horacio Valcárcel.
The director of the film "Begin again" (Volver a empezar) works as usual - on the stage together with actors, with whom he usually tries before filming and who does not choose casting, because it seems to him "humiliating" and also believes that "participating in the vocation of the "communicating" and "participating in the vocation
Many of the actors he has chosen for the Blood of May have already appeared before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflowers, is represented by the young generations.
Garcia is not expected to receive any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for what’s going to happen next, but then you realize that you’re working just for the money, and so you’re willing to make one more movie,” Garci explains with a more than 30-year directorial career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
The Sevillan flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of the Catalan father (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and the Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, moved with her family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dance.
She lived a life full of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and fought for the abolition of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was enchanted by Isabela Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me – it seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about grasping her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So "dance of the butterfly" evoked me guajira or "dance of the snake" some tanga.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also corresponds to this aesthetic," she says.
The performance is expected to involve two exceptional personalities: Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabelle in one performance as in "La puerta abierta" (La puerta abierta), and with dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her ex-girlfriend.
"Matilde represents the elder Tortola, a mature figure.
I’m happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it’s a great honor for me.”
The performance also features the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paca Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; drums of El Pájara, the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of an eternal guide who are always behind them, who are the primates, who are the artists
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place during her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point, but nobody knows her today and even less appreciates her creation,” Bayon said.
The performance starts today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
The book "Diary of the Freshly Married" also concludes the triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of the Newly Married" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government of the "Trienále-Zenobie" of the 2006 "Celebration of the Year" (Trienále-Zenobie and Juana)
The "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with the new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the renovation of the Nobel Museum House and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The One Ray of the Sun", which was opened in May of this year, and after the congress was scheduled to take place in New York.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Diary of the Freshly Married" edited by Peter Taberne and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's most famous Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn’t like it that much anymore.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Without Bad Intention" and under the weight of the knowledge that Newman has left, reveals his unhappy vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be severely ill.
He was still a guy for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and country has died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons to be proud.
When times are rough and people without virtues and only a handful of those who are worthy of your admiration, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from a drug addiction foundation based on honoring his first-born son, who died of an overdose, to his own brand of homemade food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that has cost a lot of effort to free itself from a suicidal food culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the height of his career.
The evil boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"This fox has put a pretty high bar on all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few to have the courage to live as Paul Newman lived - based on honesty and leading a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today’s media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, there are such people, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who was loyal, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a fillet at home?" he joked.
May he be accompanied by pride in the fact that there is harmony on earth between his daughters and admirers - this is not very common in America.
“Of all the great roles he incarnated, he was the proudest in the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self-sacrificing philanthropist.”
The Imperfect Races of the Olympics in Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the unsuccessful year 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask, are we ready?
If we're going to follow yesterday's race, I'm saying no!
He was spoken of as a perfect race, and in my judgment he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a bunch of nonsense that if there was an evaluation and I was a tester, it would clearly be insufficient.
But let’s look at it from the beginning, one by one.
The nonsense starts with picking up the race number, because of which one has to leave earlier.
That doesn’t seem bad to me, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip to avoid overcrowding the track).
Oh, no, no, no.
Here one had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there only for that) and (after the proper queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a size S T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
It was because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because they are less fabric and are cheaper?
Well, that's a bit small compared to what happened on race day.
In addition to having to go very early for the chip and the front on it took over 15 minutes, he still had to hand over his backpack.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is in the race, where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as was to be expected, the race started and we haven’t put our backpacks down yet, and when it was done, picking up was much worse.
The wait further extended by 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general uprising and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, don’t see the right time in evaluating the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I guess, didn’t record the right start time for me.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn’t have come at me.
So I think we're going to have to make a dream out of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Conference on New Technologies, Microsoft unveiled further developments in a new image recognition system and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not too clever, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the company's premises, intercepting) and perceiving.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this “receptionist” can find out how many people are in the room, who they are – even remember what they are wearing – and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort the attendees by conversation groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records the third person and understands that he does not belong to the group that speaks to him and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's going to see someone, and tells her that he's going to devote himself to her in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Awesome.
This is, of course, the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial uselessness, they would be five times more powerful — man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover like thunder, considering that Microsoft version from version adds new features to Windows and other "extras".
A change of direction would be a deserving act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that this was Google’s first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, as it is a necessary layer for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's the truth.
It never goes away, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around windows.
What is the use of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it and here is a small example.
I took this photo in one of the restrooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count on 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one shining in Edward Zwick's "Bloody Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "Bloody Diamond", and is also part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to get into the list of his life roles, we can dive into the image of a typical muscle with a pointed moustache that lifts the weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton men's underpants, adhesive and without sleeves.
English speakers call it a tank, but Le Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels stands out above everyone else.
First of all, for its colloquial name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdano, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost inconspicuous) Belgian flag, which models of the most emblematic flaps have as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
It also produces college hoodies, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, children's suits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
It's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. Whoever's a father doesn't care."
A huge image with her sister did not stop her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new fashion appearances very seriously.
For Mónica, it means much more than just the fact that some pretty, famous girl lends her name.
In Paris, a promotional event was organized by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most significant fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
She is heartfelt and daring and close to you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that Penélope and I have designed for Mango this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentine.
It was a difficult but exciting day at the same time.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you are already working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 50s and 60s, and we got a lot of inspiration from them.
I also love to walk around the city and watch women walk dressed, how they combine and layer their clothes, I do this very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
I liked my clothes, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, talk in my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I walked dressed.
You know that we dancers are based on how we are adjusted to feel good in our classes and exams when looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you really penetrate the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect to the designers and professionalism.
You were 30 years old recently, did you have a crisis?
No way.
I feel better than ever before, I'm thirteen.
I find that the woman is already ready, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I've been doing what I want from the beginning, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I will be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father is concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a sense of happiness and raise him with great love.
When it comes to the film, there are several premieres of the films you made last year.
It's like that, and I'm looking forward to seeing them in the movies.
I come from the theatre world, and so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and so of course it is not possible.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Regardless of how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the show pier next to Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to the pier as a model.
Only Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, called me and invited me to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Women for a Better Life", and the clothes we showed - I also selected two models from our collection for Mango - did not auction off this organization and the proceeds were not auctioned off.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There are many things that are said about her, and I know her, and I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's engaged in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but when she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
For the benefit of third world women, I'll do what's necessary.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Interior Ministry requires a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol to have a system installed in his car that will prevent him from starting the car drunk or if he does not breathe.
The proposal was announced in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the High Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is to return drivers behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to complete a course of traffic retraining.
In addition to the National Transportation Safety Authority, the General Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Car Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of drivers charged with driving drunk more than once are again in that state behind the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe beforehand or if the alcohol concentration is higher than the permissible concentration.
Its price exceeds <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that in the first year after the introduction of the device, infringements were reduced by 65% in vehicles equipped with this device.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behavior before it leads to a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its introduction, since legislation can be implemented in the usual way, the necessary adaptation of the criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial cars and utility vehicles have already been tested.
Tomorrow, the Congress of MPs will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Workers’ Socialist Party) proposal, which recommends installing the system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as stated in the program, a Spanish Air Force plane landed at the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico D.F. with the Prince and Princess of Asturias.
The sun was just setting, but his rays had forced him to close his eyes with his hand so that he could see a subsequent pair coming out of the plane.
Underneath the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, so it's great, it's not going to get to the airport at that time to pick up people... she's from here or whatever...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
- Yeah, that's right.
The Mexican press, however, knows who the prince and princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport right next to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorary salve.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit and the princess, dressed very neatly and with widened hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported that in D. F. there is a threat of a storm.
Before they move into the hall, where official delegations await, they smile at the photographers and freely pose for them.
At the door of the hotel where they will be housed, one of the four largest in the city, they are awaited by a well-known Mexican television reporter.
The Best-Subventioned Fashion Award
There is probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion prize than Paris, and there is probably no better designer and bonviva than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable an international presentation to new fashion talent.
The prize is subsidized in the amount of 300,000 euros.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, winner of the first year, yesterday looked at her designs in the Manga window at 54 Haussmann boulevard in Paris and almost cried with a smile.
Of course, it is the second largest store of the company in Europe and it has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is located in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designer Valentin for taking over the presidency of the competition jury, caused us to finally have a splendid dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
Mango’s ceremonially decorated presidential desk looked a little more amazing next to Chagall’s most eminent works.
Nati, who with heartbroken grief for the recent death of her brother showed nothing, put on the dress of this brand and the jewels of Allah over which her breath was hiding, and hung in her son Luis - almost two meters of elegance - she accompanied Valentina to the front of the table at his dinner.
Andik, the head and owner of Mango, welcomed him and, as a real gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild were left without a jacket, as they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the shop in - hand-designed - pants and shirt and at dinner she changed into long black sexy dresses, was impressed by the night walk through the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledova, she showed us the hall for the ballet rehearsals and the time of the rehearsals.
Inés Sastre showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before she left for a visit to the adjacent buildings of the palace.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance not to use any fragrances in his rooms.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about the chaotic and furious everyday life.
And not only that, they are all summarized in one book, which on September 30th will bring relaxation to the bookstore.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 o’clock as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself engulfed in the rapid rhythm that brings present life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
No, that number is no more than 1001 and no less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside of the yogi position, classic massages and "spa" therapies, has collected a whole "menu" of options on the pages of her book, tailored to each individual's taste and time options.
The book is called "1001 Ways to Relax" and thanks to the publishing house of Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "guideline" denies this opinion.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If your veins are no longer full of adrenaline, which rebalances your body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Speaking from sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and the chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chili chi chili
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but in reality it's insignificant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloccus.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure not one of you was told that he spoke out of sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fever), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no one reason to explain her appearance.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nightmares, nocturnal enuresis (night aid) or sleeplessness, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fever, stressful or exacerbated situations.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist to find out if he does not have any problem that causes him great anxiety and thus manifests itself.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to upset the child too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid spooky or somewhat violent TV shows or series.
For very nervous children and those who can work to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them to gain some inner peace.
This will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
When somniloquy appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that he will not remember anything of what happened the next day.
Useful Advice
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Keep in mind that if you feel very anxious several times in a row, it would be wise to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If he understands what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and draw information from him.
It will be of no use, because when he sleeps, he is not conscious, so that he can arrange his thoughts.
Moreover, you will hear what he is saying, but you do not know what he is thinking and why he is saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
It's not funny.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s just an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long lean period.
Without playing a particularly big game, the Yellow-Blacks created more chances and were able to turn one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this clash, in which the attackers were hard to enforce.
After the first attempt of the captain of the guests Kauffmann, who with a shot from a distance just about a hair passed the link, began to have Illhaeusern slightly up and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to annoy Dan.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive ridge in the middle of the field and left only an agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well positioned to process the ball reflected by the previous Diebold's attempt.
However, Golman Ilhaeuserna did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the locker room and leave his teammates in a state of weakness.
Dannemarie, however, could not take advantage of it, and the eleven of Illhaeusern, who had only withdrawn a little to "densify" the defense, did not cause any more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball, after great confusion, flew very close to the mare.
Sarkozy faces angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride across Brittany.
To confront a demonstration of the strength of fishermen who on Monday severely disrupted the accessibility of several Brittany and Normandy ports, the French president decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit", and hoped to "come up with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to gain measures against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak above an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to David Martinon, a spokesman for the Elysée Palace, the president will “speak to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions for employing and paying seafarers.”
Nicolas Sarkozy is awaited by the fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out a snail operation in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10km of constipation.
Quiberon's recreational harbour was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, a filtration dam was put into operation.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday as they burned tyres and pallets in front of fuel warehouses in Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement expanded to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in port, or Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until they decide to act by themselves until Wednesday’s meeting at the ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" will decide on how to continue on the path taken and on its participation in a prepared meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Department who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not be released from anything" and "they do not want to arrive in Paris", said Liliane Cariou, the head of the fisheries department in Lorient, for example.
Occupational fishermen who do not pay a petroleum tax currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but consider that the profitability threshold of the ship is reached only when petroleum is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Great
Butche Cassidy and Kid has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes bowed to the film's legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies on 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession that flies above the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft designer, has maintained its 2008 supply assumptions with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer has a lot of promise from the Chinese market, especially with regard to the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers over a span of eight years.
AIG plans to sell 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which has been overrun by U.S. monetary authorities, is considering transferring more than 15 percent of its assets to repay the $85 billion it was given as a down payment, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities in the international field and retirement activities in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to examine a possible transfer.
It was not possible to obtain any affirmative statement from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its aviation leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurance insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must promptly obtain cash in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank, with the risk that the U.S. authorities will confiscate 80% of its capital, while at the same time diluting it to the appropriate shareholder ratio.
Paris. Analysis of the historical session Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s bailout plan: The Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell from 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
It recorded the largest point drop in its history (by 684.81 points) on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trading following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technology component lost, according to the definitive data after trading closed, 199.61 points and stabilized at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e., 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Squeezed since the beginning of the session, Wall Street literally collapsed after an unexpected rejection of the House bailout plan, a plan that was supposed to allow some stability in the markets to be found again.
228 votes against and 205 against refused to grant Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market that Congress is unable to accept a certain plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
“If this project is indeed doomed to extinction (...), the staff will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks to ignite the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And stressing the urgency of the situation, Piegza pointed out that in the United States, “every new day brings the fall of one financial institution.”
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the repurchase of Bank Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and called for urgent intervention in favor of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are facing “not just the US crisis, but the global crisis,” FTN Financial analysts said.
The bond market has risen sharply.
Revenue from 10-year cash vouchers fell to 3.632 per cent from 3.827 per cent on Friday evening, while 30-year yields fell to 4.161 per cent from 4.357 per cent on the previous day.
Obama wins points in first TV duel
After the first debate between the two candidates in the White House on Friday, the second debate was to find out who of the pair won John McCain and Barack Obama.
The Republican and Democrat campaign’s command tents weren’t surprised when both announced their victory in a TV duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, however decent he may have been, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop the decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup constitution, whose public opinion poll on Saturday attributed a five-point lead to Obama (49% vs. 44% for McCain), considers the Democrat to have won the duel.
Among the indecisive voters who matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of the respondents, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attributes the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the anticipated good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She’s talented,” Bill Clinton said over the weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while emphasizing his rival’s “naivety” on issues that formed the core of the first clash.
"It seems that Senator Obama did not understand that..." it sounded like a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
In such an offensive spirit, Republican television spots have been carried since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He did not lose his mind and proved to be brief and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama did," a Democratic spot said over the weekend, accusing the Republican of not taking enough into account the impact of the crisis on the "normal American."
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered at a pre-election meeting in North Carolina under heavy rain.
He hasn't even uttered the words "middle class" or "working"; the financial breakdown clearly favors Obama, whom the Americans consider more capable of saving the economy on the edge of the abyss.
“Next week there could be a decisive reversal,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “economic cleverness” to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic nominee, the current disaster is “the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as run by George Bush and as supported by Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite Wall Street’s unexpected leaps, he should be able to cut taxes on 95% of Americans, and also warned that realizing the country’s eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of health insurance.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates were cautiously avoiding questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial aid plan that Congress passed last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What, did you notice that there were some elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of polling stations in Minsk's main square to protest the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resign".
Some admit that they didn’t even go to the polls: “What good would it be if they did whatever they wanted to do with my voice anyway,” says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has maintained a friendly attitude towards foreign observers in order to re-establish negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a shift towards democracy.
Sanctions, including banning visas for 40 Belarusians and freezing certain assets, could be lifted if elections are considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote counting," Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties, complained.
"It's a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexandr Milinkievi<0xC4><0x8D>, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-European movement, "because it's important who counts the votes, and we have executive power.
If some opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed, not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space in television, meetings in regions and bills.”
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political action, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
For if our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election, will not declare the election valid.
It stresses that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What do you, have you noticed that some elections were held?" asks social democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was not a foot in the ballot box.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones that fit the regime the most.”
The silence of the night once again took place in the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on the success.
Conversation - Blood that is sure again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly delighted, as Héma-Québec has become one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after the blood-contaminated scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state blood reserve managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Board was contaminated with the Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the lack of public awareness, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and making recommendations not to repeat such a calamity.
While Judge Krever delayed reporting, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this was the role of the Gélinea Committee.
Following the Gélineau and Krever report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to manage Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society for the Supply of All Provinces and Both Territories.
“When Héma-Québec began its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was depressing.
Through constant efforts to improve the safety of blood products and constant work in this area over the next years, we have regained public confidence," he says, proudly adding that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94 percent of the Quebec population already had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
“At that time, we saw many cases of human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,” says a woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread with blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which in the event that we do not know and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, the measures to exclude them.
In April 1999, we therefore rejected blood from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proved that this disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to stick to the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV emerged on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which allow the donor blood to detect the presence of the virus itself, rather than the presence of the antibodies on which the tests used before were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment the patient is infected and the moment when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our technicians, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing it and without being able to figure it out.
These improvements allowed to significantly reduce the risk of acquiring AIDS through blood transfusions.
One in 12 million people are at risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV today.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through the blood product to appear.
I believe that we can get or prescribe blood transfusions that are necessary to heal today in complete peace of mind,” says Héma-Québec’s head of management.
“The challenge for us for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of disease can occur in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the bloodstream by the stab of insects.
We need to be constantly careful," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also count on a sufficient supply.
“The needs are growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for donation.
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, according to the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
14% of people donating blood are not accepted on average because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have visited a country where mud colds are treated, they are excluded for one year.
"With this 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
Members of the donor network, however, need to be supplemented in proportion to how old they are and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to persuade people to donate blood, especially to sustain and encourage them to become regular donors.
“Life is so unfettered today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, flows blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand cord blood sample into the bank and we expect to collect over a thousand per year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year,” says Dr. Decary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Héma-Québec doesn't have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the USL's first division semi-final series yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and crucial quarter-final match played for the total number of goals, thanks to a 3:1 win (4:3 is the goal balance after both games) over the Sounders of Seatt.
Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-sided defenseless first half, backers David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could get along with Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
On Friday, during the first of two matches of the quarterfinals, Impact suffered a 2–1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-finals, Impact will measure its strength with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder tied a home game deficit of 3:1 and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps still moved on to the semi-final round with a total score of 5:4.
The impact is expected to clash with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will be confirmed only today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first Canadiens are ready to start the season.
A team consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekan and Andrej Kosticin last night at the Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win the Canadiens 3:2 to separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev picked up one innings in this fourth tricolor victory of the six pre-match matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during the separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said Rus.
"I need one more game to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to do too much," noted Guy Carbonneau.
“I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets on the north
The prime minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year.
Immediately after the end of the Congress of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where in today's supplementary elections the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running.
"Subjecting the borders of our last major northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually appealing way at the conclusion of the congress of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in some picture mill.
On three winding canvases ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous funds, just like in the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out early elections in the fall, although he noted that he had a very busy schedule.
The “Plan Nord” is the fourth dimension of the “vision” that the prime minister intends for Quebec, the vision of a “new economic space” that includes a labor agreement with France, a convention between Canada and Europe, and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently mentioned often in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North represents a “gem with enormous potential,” but did not specify a deadline, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further expanded: in particular hydropower plants, forests, but above all the mining sector, stimulated by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
The North, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory is twice the size of France with us", "is in Quebec.
And it’s not just in us, it’s in us,” he said, as if he wanted to show that he was referring to a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, pointed out the Prime Minister: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after theatrically silent to look at the huge map behind his back.
The north, 70% of Quebec, includes the part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said during a press conference.
“It is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all the previous governments.
“There is one border line that has not existed for a long time, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, I will take this position again in the name of the government,” he said.
Otherwise, “in the context of climate change, we also need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of a north-west transition that will open year-round as a result of melting glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy territory.
And what about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government will be very attentive to them and that the project will be beneficial to them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekistan MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with some thirty communities.
The work was initiated by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be outlined".
Moreover, the development of the North should be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan will be “co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as steadily following the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the ever-changing topics of the weekend, which was started on Friday with a big cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s rise to the top of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross Beauharnois' headquarters on the Adelard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who led the Peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourass, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time a conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, premiered from 1957 to 1963.
When the line came up for the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric power plant, Charest stressed that its start-up was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his member base, sparking considerable applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly 2009, did not rule out the possibility of convening elections in the fall of this year, which the law allows him.
However, he stressed that his program is loaded, especially the missions of the Federal Council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress provided the head of the Liberals with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "efforts to change the constitution", which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition was skeptical of the Northern Plan in its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois again outlined the Northern Quebec Development Policy, which the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, she renounced this policy.
If she held on to it, "we would be on today," Marois said alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we wish it wasn't just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumonta, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - The Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, the former minister of “justice” (ironically) in Harper’s cabinet, who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that it was “shame” for Canada.
To slander a woman who has led a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the prime minister’s environment and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government which, as the only Western country involved, has not relocated to the homeland of its national who was imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
The government, which does not take into account that at the time of the acts that are being accused of taking place, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, despite Canada signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the guilt of the defendant.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and especially the Canadian Bar Association are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can await a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: it cares little about the fact that this young man is psychologically destroyed next, undoubtedly permanently, after so many years of torture.
We don't realize it, but we're just witnessing the slippery erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," the word that Harper is bending so much and that sounds so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to imprison him according to the will of the head of the minority government so far (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in the party that proclaims Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has given up what has created the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame on you, Mr. Toewsi, in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched a prosecution of three authors and a poor little publisher for insulting the honor in order to spark a "transparent public debate" and demands six million from them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truthfulness, especially in the case of prosecution for insult to honor, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver completely misses this crucial distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate, to bring to nothing anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a very uneven battle with an army of lawyers supported by the almost miserable pockets of a mining company.
The tactics in these uneven fights, by the way, often consist in destroying the defendants in order to enforce conciliation proceedings that will shut the mouths of the counterparty and, moreover, frighten anyone who dares to devote himself to this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it had to present its view of the whole thing to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in a few countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate normally consists in the exchange of ideas, not in the wounds of the scab.
The mining companies therefore had no choice but to open their books, their documentation, and create a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent scientific teams that could bring the whole thing to light.
Barrick Gold, however, does not seem to have confidence in public opinion, and shyly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" and at the same time despise the views of the same public?
In the Vice-Presidential world, this word seems to mean only high-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; that is a rather narrow concept.
In a democracy, they also have the right to speak for themselves.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and re-evaluate the case, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant should be mouth-closed (as part of their prosecution of the "public debate").
Forget Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom to research and seek the truth that is essential to any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like without facing repeated persecution, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could create it if it followed the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The exaggerated Barrick Gold lawsuit clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it does not have the slightest desire to conduct a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures to limit this kind of unjustified prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operations - Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan, using $700 billion to curb the financial crisis that has been sweeping Wall Street for months, still needs to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of its application by elected representatives, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money stored, new measures to seize the number of houses seized for non-payment, and also the right to monitor the amount of salaries paid to executives rescued by companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after ending a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said in a statement.
"Everything was done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the crisis that is currently taking place on Wall Street," he said.
“That’s a crucial point: if we don’t do it, the trauma, chaos and disruption to everyday life of Americans will be huge,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, the negotiations have gone to maximum speeds out of fear of the effect that a further failure at the disposal of investors would have.
The deadline was set for the opening of markets this morning.
Both U.S. presidential candidates were invited to negotiate later, and both expressed their support for the deal, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited himself with supplementing the agreement with some measures, in particular one aimed at enabling homeowners to preserve their homes, and salary measures for state-sponsored workers rescued by companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is no reason to congratulate them.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The rough traits I’ve read [show] that this is something that we’ll all have to spend and with which we’ll be able to move on.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The 700-billion-dollar plan aims to buy dubious debts and risky and non-sale assets of U.S. financial institutions for taxpayers’ money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis triggered by the bursting of the real estate market bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then moved to other, more widespread forms of loans (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and in the decomposition of banks.
The collapse of the first draft of the agreement from last week is on the conscience of Republican MPs.
Since the Democrats have agreed that for some of the "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty, the government will only be liable, but will not buy them out, there is a belief that the unforeseen situation is doomed.
In an effort to rapproche conflicting views in Congress, a measure was enclosed stipulating that the government would be able to introduce new fees that would help it recover its deposit if it had to bear losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan expects a first deposit of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
A further $350 billion is expected to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in the rescued companies, which will pay him dividends in case of profit, and which he will be able to re-sell when it is all over.
The federal government will be able to delay the seizure procedures of the real estate related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits on the amount of valuations and compensation paid to executives of affected companies.
The plan’s sponsors would like to submit it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, the votes against this project continued to rise in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
“It’s quite clear that Washington is not listening to you,” said Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money from taxpayers is not the solution.”
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the "Committee of Skeptics", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: We ask Congress not to rush too far and to carefully examine which way to go,” he said.
At the same time, it has been reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which is on the brink of collapse since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion ($2.9 billion) in state losses due to the non-risk crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and one of the ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
This is something that people and households can appreciate in these uncertain times.”
On the other side of the Channel so far, the British government seems to have begun the nationalisation of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy the branches and accounts of the British bank’s clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government must nationalise since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with azure eyes for a long time represented his triumph, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor escape with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and relentless talents that were his own have also distanced him from the power category that produces real stars.
What a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 at his ranch in Connecticut from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, to whom he resembled and for a long time was somehow his rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly a more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it looked at the whole country in love with self made mana, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that in the early 1950s studied acting in Yale, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in the theater, on television and in the movie.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also an auto racer who placed second at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, despite having formed a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
It also leaves the shadowy spots of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the rumour of his own show business, which will forever remain a mystery to some extent.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s departure this weekend has caused dizziness for film lovers, while his big roles together compete on the black canvas of memories.
After him, more than half a century of ever-changing American Seventh Art defiles.
In memory, a charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on the Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams, resurfaces.
From a less ancient past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, anxious at an advanced age with a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the abused, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, taken over after his death, which brought Newman to real acquaintance in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's amazing The Hustler (1961), he will play the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which will bring him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
That face that's been wandering for ages, that's him.
And again he.
In his career, they compete against each other in different epochs.
Young people know him mainly because of the iconic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He ended his career as the Irish mafia's Road to Perdition actor Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends who left the craft rather early, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood with his goldsmiths, glamour, and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered him "a lively challenge to underplaying", judging by the fact that in his performances he pushed too much on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
However, he played the first lovers less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and despairers, whose declines and rebellions were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman has uncovered the little-known sides of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, based on the Canadian novel by Margaret Laurence, starring his wife Joanne Woodward, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, who was lost to an overdose, was given the 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sadness and sadness.
In a flurry of honors Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former co-star Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, such are the main characteristics of the deceased actor.
Leaving aside his legendary career, a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, an opponent of the decline of Hollywood is also leaving.
We were used to seeing his image on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, which may have seemed rather unpleasant to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Heavy Childhood.
So, instead of letting himself be swayed by fame, Newman engaged himself in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: “Always and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to follow the path of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, an exemplary citizen.
What was produced in the factory on invoices Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on October 8, the trial will begin in the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates.
In addition to other criminal offences, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organization, which has resulted in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor’s office, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often proved the fulfillment of tasks in fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and local governments – totaling about 65 million forints – was sent partly to the treasury of Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money received in the public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual countervailing and the commitments made by the association were never met.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoices were fake.
Prints to these invoices came from the Yozsefvaros market, round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasa.
The name of the companies on which the production of invoices is to take place was decided, among other things, on the roundabout along the northern bank of the Balaton, to which István Ladose sent János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, he was first appointed to look out for guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he requested invoices for his consumption, according to the model of which invoices were then produced within the framework of public competitions issued, among others, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and the Self-government of the capital.
The invoices were mostly issued by István Lados and his associate András <0xC5><0x90>rim, who, according to our information, wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
During his "study trip", Lados looked out at a cellar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this hospitality facility provided catering for the 90-member group of the Biztos Pont.
However, so many people, according to the head of the company, would not have come to this facility at once.
Likewise, there were formal and content errors in the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by a foundation called Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért.
The guest house in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet there were one hundred and thirty guests on the invoice.
However, the printers with a rich imagination exaggerated this, even when they indicated on the documents a company dedicated to the same hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounting according to the information provided to the State Prosecutor's Office the documents that sounded on the name Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>r<0xC3><0xB2>val ani<0xC3><0xB2>yért and Ho.
The head of the company Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas for hvg.hu said that when they summoned him to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
In addition to the formalities, he also disagreed that, according to the invoice, they accommodated a hundred people, because they only have eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, catering was also mentioned on the invoice, and their restaurant has not been functioning for a long time.
Eager invoice manufacturers did not even make sure that the well-looked Budapest travel agency only organizes foreign trips, and on the invoice with payment in cash, which was also not consistent with the company’s billing practice, said fools as a travel brokerage service in Hungary.
In addition, as was found in the course of the investigation, the document also stated VAT, although the organization of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
On the four documents issued by Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, among other things, the amount of VAT. The activity of the company is not covered by the mentioned 25 per cent, but 15 per cent VAT, in addition, the facts were issued by the hotel staff, but only printed facts.
In addition, the "publishers" corrupted the invoice, for example, by stating at one company how it turned out thanks to an investigation by the State Prosecutor's Office, as an activity carried out by road transport of goods, which the company, which was originally based on investment advice, did not carry out.
The fact that the invoices issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the associations XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false has also been proven to be false due to formal deviations - inadequate invoice format and false stamp.
Just as in the case of Ravenna c. s. or the Sport Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that the invoices would be issued by them.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that the company HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért company was eating there, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also refused to issue the paper.
Invoices are deliberately issued
The second group of invoicers is those who knew they were going to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Eséla Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialistak.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab s.r.o. was forced to issue a fictitious account by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Zuschlag and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s.r.o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Atlasz and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> with invoices worth approximately five million forints, after which the actual economic activity was not.
Neither is the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which organizations have forgotten to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies include those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was an authorised representative of the Ukrainian director of Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing in the trading of fuels and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the information found in the investigation, the invoices were purchased by cash investment s.r.o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a Romanian man, to whom the documents concerning the company were also to be handed over to Ivan Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppa and the Együtt and Armadik Évezredért foundations and accepted their countervailing.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k.s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
At the request of co-defendant Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the Atlasz and Y-Generación associations linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State Prosecutor’s Office concluded that Kubatov had reached 10 percent of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the tender for the Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, Y-Generação and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals for a public tender to the Mihálya Táncsicse Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organisation of the Socialist Party.
They received 500,000 forints each, but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To prevent this from happening, TMA has submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
These invoices were found during a home inspection at the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants will probably describe the process of producing invoices, as they did at the prosecutor’s office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything himself.
His statement so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to explain everything extensively, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it's in his interest - in exchange for a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, maybe the socialists made a deal with him and the Zusi will take it on.
He could have been offended by the fact that his requests for mitigation of the conditions of his detention, namely his placement in house detention, have not yet been heard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much greater damage than they have yet to compensate, can walk freely, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of trumpeting: Why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalue goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known – and seemingly irrational – behavior have been revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to lag behind in an auction like eBay, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
Research with the help of an experimental auction tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in the play auction, using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method to examine the active areas of the brain of the subjects.
In both games, the participants could win money, but when playing at an auction, an important element of which is to beat the other side, the whole under the cortex, called the striatum, began to function intensively during the loss.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region plays a role in the "self-replacement" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, it is possible to explain the price screwing up by trying to avoid a sudden striatal reaction.
To support their theory, members of the research team from among economists conducted a cross-sectional financial survey.
Under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
Members of the other group were also promised that if they exited the game victoriously, they would receive an additional $15 for the reward.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, the members also lost the money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, everywhere that one was emphasized victory and the other loss.
Members of the “against losing” group, however, were willing to go higher than they were in the control and “victory” group, which confirms the neuroscientists’ hypothesis.
“These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
They have so far explained the phenomena observed in the auctions of the joys of winning and avoiding risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped us resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason for this is that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the causes of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the origins of the disease, spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive system (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses of blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no type C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of infected food, they are usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, compulsion to vomit.
After that, jaundice, lightening of the stools and darkening of the urine will form on the skin and eye whites. Treatment can last for two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from the more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected people is medicated.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells insidiously, and so the first symptoms will appear in many cases in 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention, carrying out regular screening, is very important.
In three groups, the disease is much more common than the average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
At present, the estimated global number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can prove already routine laboratory tests, a person should contact his or her practitioner if he or she notices any symptoms of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infectiousness and preventing the formation of cancer.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized worldwide by organizations representing the sick in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, to the causes of its formation and to the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt that much?
According to the results of recent research, belief in God acts as a certain analgesic, which may have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how belief in the god of pain affects a person, the British newspaper The Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all watched a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholics were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examined the human brain in detail, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
Research is the first of a series of studies involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
Exactly the test was carried out by attaching a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the subject, which emitted electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to observe two paintings: Sassoferrat’s Virgin Mary from the 17th century and the Lady with the Border of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety in believers, while they chose da Vinci's painting because it does not differ much from the first and seems to them a soothing impression.
The subjects spent half an hour on an MRI scanner and during this time received in four successive parts 20 electroshocks, while separately watching the image with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe”, as if they had been “cared for” and “quiet, they were filled with peace”.
When watching a religious-themed picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard’s work before them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any highly impressive image, even in atheists, only to find the right photograph.
“We need to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change, and in many cases it will change our personality,” Wright said.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the pain regulation of believers if they showed them some Madonna from Leonardo or a painter of a similar calibre.
Would a view of the good Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You're what you're going to share
On his 10th birthday, Google can declare that people can find him in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations go to and what interests them.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s chief executives, this is still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics are concerned, making parallels with Orwell’s dark vision, they are not clear about the very essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for the founders of Google to stick to their original intention, which was: "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to a Google spokesperson, the company is still only at the beginning of working with all the information after ten years of world-class work.
When asked what the next five years would be, Schmidt said that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what kind of work would be good for me?” – to such seemingly simple questions, however, software users will not be able to answer information until they know how to do it.
Not all Internet users are well aware that during an Internet search, the search words are captured exactly from which IP address they were searched and to which pages they moved after the search.
For example, with the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can keep a history of their browsing, they can look back on what they were looking for and what they clicked on, thanks to which, in the long run, they generate findings tailored much more directly to them - on the same logic Rebímens will be based.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I’m doing? – users who are afraid to look at Google’s data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is rather frightening, the counter-reaction does not evoke in Internet users the awareness of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most well-known example of this was probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of paedophiles from the Orkut community sites set up through it.
However, internet users who are concerned about personal rights could have taken a break in May when the company, hand in hand with the EFF e-rights organization, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced in the future by any article of the Constitution to provide any information to the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully extracted nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained by appealing to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act passed years ago, but it still failed to get the lists of monthly searched items into the lists of individual users, respectively.
The view on Google is so contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear the provision of their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by starting to use Google services, subjected to harm, and stand against it with revolt, which belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its savage branch, grouping enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, see in it a new generation of big companies, the "corporation that's now buzzing," unlike its rival Microsoft, considered a target for the conquest of the world.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money from them for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and package of programs acts as much more accessible, youthful, "cooler" than the practice of the official softwar.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which has brought with it just one of the most inclined keywords of recent years: Web 2.0.
For Web 2.0 is nothing more than cooperation, that we deliberately leave behind tracks and use the communication channels we have at our disposal, and although their scope is different for everyone else, the essence remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can have a profile on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording the music he listened to, all of which can then be connected to navigation systems, such as Facebook or Friend.
In doing so, we can read about many exemplary cases, from which it dawns: a girlfriend in the morning, looking at the flood of photos of mutual friends, it is easy to find out with whom her furious friend spent the evening, or the company can fire his worker only because on his blog, he describes his work.
One who lives online life consists of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to conceal something or at least avoid Google’s monopoly has the option (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search engine, but does not intentionally leave any traces).
For example, a large number of people do not voluntarily register on community sites so that they cannot be found. Google’s online application from a text editor to a photo editor and a news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and that do not create the best possible profile among us.
Public opinion does not expect too secretly when Google will show teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense ad spaces threaten advertising agencies’ investments, and the services introduced by Microsoft are steadily accelerating at an ever-increasing rate.
Critical observers, however, also find counterpoints to Google's influence in the disquieting impression: the top management, for example, has completely rejected the protests of employees after raising the fee for the company's nursery, any frequent daily meals of employees, according to the management.
One of the internal rules of the company is that it never advertises in advance with the profile of the company new services, only when they can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the next months and years can avoid the world in new places: while some believe that the project of Google will be focused on scanning and archiving
The fact that Google is compiling a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for the next generation of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow’s famous novel “Scroogled” describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which a person can be frighteningly well approached only with the help of data from Golo.
Dual killer from Oz helped remove traces of two teenagers
Two juveniles were questioned by police in the case of the double murder in Ozd, according to reasonable suspicions, helping to remove traces of this crime, a spokesman for the Borsod county police department said on Tuesday.
The persons were informed of the activity of which they were suspected and are currently being charged with assisting in the crime.
Both teenagers, according to MTI, two girls, are being prosecuted in freedom.
Assistance to a crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Oz, a 23-year-old man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of a pre-planned multiple murder for greedy reasons.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old young man owed a larger amount to the 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor last Wednesday to a plant in Oz, where he killed first the man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was preparing in advance for the crime, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion CZK – for the purchase of a hundred percent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party despite the fact that the Czechs had already excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is the fact that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic journal E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to applicants for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far submitted an offer.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the collapse of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent share, followed by <0xC4><0x8C>eská spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of European letters
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European newspapers already recall "September 11th".
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the American president, accuses the Roman La Repubblica. The president was not even able to squeeze his own party in support of that swiftly paid bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which was reminiscent of billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second 9/11.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the global economy has brought the lack of political leadership to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly increasing, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
While Bush’s plan was not perfect, after a vote in Congress, there is a risk that Washington will not offer a political tool to resolve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air – at a time when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states can throw a life-saving ring at waving monetary institutions, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
However, if more banks collapse as domineering cubes, then neither money nor further improvisation will be enough.
In the long run, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the monetary institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, according to the Vienna-based Der Standard, which fears that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to go deep into their pockets to solve the crisis, becoming increasingly real.
The European Union has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is like a tsunami on the old continent, until now.
The "rescuers" do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they set themselves firmly, in which case it is reasonable to reach out to taxpayers' money to avoid even more damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of a beetle
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitation of the detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
In bees, for example.
The initial strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at CEATEC in Japan, was brought to the engineers from Nissan by the beekeepers. It was about how to build a new generation of collision-preventing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has developed the BR23C biomimetic robotic steering system, a robotic minicar with bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of helping create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging," said Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand for technology PR and R&D.
An important role is played by the folded eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eye, the engineers resorted to the idea of a laser distance meter.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters ahead of BR23C in a 180-degree field of vision, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which instantly turns into a collision avoidance operation.
The obstacle is caught during a fraction of a second, then the robotic car begins to mimic the movements of the bee and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this swinging maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
“If this were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” said Toshijuki Ando, head of the Robotic Car Mobility and Project Laboratory.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology fits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective packaging, within which precipitation is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should not take longer than a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or transversely, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees in avoidance, only the possibility of rotation, acceleration and deceleration was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, instinctive, intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process, much less then to store data.
This mechanism must process and respond only to a few incoming signals per second.
It does not need to store and respond using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only memory the size of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step in the development of technology for immediate avoidance, which Nissan estimates could reach mass-produced cars within a decade.
Another application option may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles in the road, would lead the driver to the specified final destination.
A dear child has a name.
The $700 billion bailout bill, which is to be split into several installments and aims to buy back bad-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further talks, which ended just after midnight on Saturday, congressional officials reached an agreement in a few days of a $700 billion bailout debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who said that only the drafting of the agreement remains.
Both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the compromise.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said on the result of the compromise: "The programme will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken."
The written form of the package was released prior to the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (that is, on Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but did not cause any particular rise in the stock market.
On the draft legal norm hearing on the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to be established, the program will be voted on on Monday first by the House of Representatives, then there will be a turn in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, after which news of the deal was also welcomed at the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress achieved overnight and appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend a total of $700 billion at once on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
Now it is possible to spend in the first half of the maximum amount of 700 billion, in such a way that 250 billion will be spent immediately after the matter is expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Treasury Department will buy for them securities secured by mortgages, which are valued as $100 billion worth of decisions unqualified, the fate remains.
The program will be supervised by a special committee, which will also include the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance can use combined tactics within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy back low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other "toxic" loans.
The purchase can take place as part of the auction and directly, said the competent representatives of the ministry.
The legal norm will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance program, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee on the funds that are of concern, for which the company will then pay the price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means for up to $700 billion to be spent on meeting the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of the systemic risk associated with the collapse of some of the major outbreaks.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to enact the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, heads of banks who are in trouble and waiting for state aid can count on the government to cut their payouts – which in the overseas slang is simply called “golden parachute”.
Their payment will only be limited in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the ministry buys in an auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the fallen directors of the banks are sent directly to retirement.
In the case of direct repurchase of poor quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the money for management is not overstated.
It should be added that the existing contracts on gold parachutes do not change, the restriction only applies to new contracts, which should be a further incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first time in American history that a statutory restriction on the remuneration of CEOs will be in place," said House Speaker Barney Frank, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state will have the right to acquire a share in the banks participating in the program, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and, with it, the rescued bank, can also make money on this transaction.
The bill’s plan states that in the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress setting out how expected losses from the financial sector can be recovered to taxpayers.
There were, of course, voices of doubt on both sides in connection with the plan.
"This is not what the American people have asked us to do, because it is not what the taxpayers' dollars will protect," California Republican congressman Darrell Issa said.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that it was precisely those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street who urged the bill to be adopted.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry rose by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared with 12.9 per cent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office reported.
Export sales prices in the industry were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent year-on-year.
As a cause of the changes in domestic and export prices in industry, production prices were higher by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, rising by 3.2 per cent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry rose only minimally compared to the previous month, by 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices in manufacturing sectors also rose slightly, by 0.1 per cent, compared to July.
The largest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the monthly price increase in the handbag and saddlery industry by 4.6 per cent and in the footwear industry by 2.5 per cent, respectively.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the production of chemical materials and products (1.6 percent).
Prices fell in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in the paper industry and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors, which play a major role in domestic industry sales, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the continued effect of the officially scheduled increase in gas prices since 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices rose the most in the oil-processing industry (32.4%).
In the metalworking sector, 13.2%, in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight, it was possible to observe a 11% increase in prices.
Prices fell in the textiles and textile products sectors (2.5 per cent) and in the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price growth ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors surpassed previous year’s prices by 18.7 percent.
In terms of segmentation by sector, domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7%) in August in the sectors involved in the production of tangible assets.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, in the energy-processing and further-processing sectors, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, we measured a price increase of 6.8 per cent, while in the case of tangible assets, a price drop of 1.4 per cent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, falling by 3.9 per cent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic payment in one month weakened against the euro by 1.7 percent, against the dollar by 7.1 percent, compared to August 2007 strengthened against the euro by 7.5 percent and against the dollar by 15.9 percent.
Next year without a visa to the United States?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is great hope that the U.S.-Hungarian Visa Waiver Agreement will enter into force around January 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "almost everything now depends on whether an electronic system of road authorisations or checks will be built offshore in a timely manner."
At the same time, she warned that the new system will not include entry permits, but tourists will have to register before departure.
As of today, the representative of Hungarian diplomacy is continuing negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit for the Hungarian Republic, and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain on bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major U.S. parties, agreed on Sunday to back a $700 billion government bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After a several-day marathon of talks between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic agreement was reached on a bailout package for banks.
The financial package, aimed at overturning the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain agree that they are the most appropriate of the two candidates to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, as economic issues came to the fore, Obama gained a certain advantage again and McCain’s lead, which he secured after the Republican convention by nominating Sarah Palin as vice president, was dissolved.
Obama said on Sunday at a pre-election assembly in Detroit that he hoped the $700 billion package bill would be swiftly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages relating to consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act immediately, responsibly ... your jobs, your savings, your entire industry, the stability of the entire economy is in danger," he told a crowd of 35,000.
He didn’t miss an opportunity to call McCain’s ideas of economics obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “Everyone will be a little bit sorry (...) but doing nothing is simply not the way to go.”
According to the Republican senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission overseeing the Minister of Finance and the withdrawal restrictions for the top officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a more important role in the talks, but that he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill on Monday.
Press overview of the German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is intact, only voters inside it have become more self-confident - so analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria, Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (mirror.de)
In an online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its father."
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
For decades, Christian socialists have rebuilt Bavaria – and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The alternation of periods is a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, and thus for Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday it ended a process that could have been predicted for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, still in the often-remembered Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that is eating up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have made a big mistake at the pace. Secularization, educational results, the settlement of Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not be without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is associated with the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more self-confident, more critical, more self-centered.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the CSU has distanced itself most from the classical civil strata; people in the free profession, businessmen, individuals with a graduation and higher education.
As a result, CSU support fell below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The leaders of the parties are restrained in coalition matters", deals with the confused internal political situation created as a result of the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> seems open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to negotiate with the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the party did not let much look into their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
And the SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in social partnerships.
The question of whether he can imagine the coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor, Faymann left open.
As stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was overrated for every fall.
Repeating this direction is not considered.
Molterer responded to the red offers with caution.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"In order to prevent a red and black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
<0xC3><0x81>róková: It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit on Equality, hosted this year by France, the current Presidency of the European Union, has started in Paris today.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People’s Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of expert negotiations in her message addressed to the plenary, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and also pays tribute to them the most serious.
The summit was launched on behalf of the French Presidency by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Negotiations were held between invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society associations working in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are excluded from the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a high school education and, as a result of poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can reach a higher level of education."
Mrs. Járóková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to establish awareness of these connections in the widest circles - among Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely he will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"Romans have the right to a high-quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their under-quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, the coherence of the European Union with emphasis on the objective and actions is necessary in order to speed up the process of desegregation of schools immediately, which is why it is of the utmost importance to properly comply with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we need to give Roma children the opportunities given by the democratic space, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," she said.
The European Year of Equal Opportunities guarantees everyone the objective of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination set out at the level of the Member States and the units of Europe.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of the duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, heads have not yet fallen, the debate on personal issues has so far been postponed by the peaks of the Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and country prime minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress last weekend in October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo were told that they would not stick to their posts with all their strength.
They tried to reassure the angry members of the faction and the base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to carry out personal consequences.
Five years ago – indeed, under the leadership of top-flight Edmund Stoiber – the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, its strength was only 43.4 percent.
CSU has been a self-governing producer of 18 percent of Germany’s GDP in Bavaria for 46 years.
While the conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, continue to hold a high position, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of the reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of a close intelligence team, which will start probing negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or with the right-wing group Free Electors, will also be able to serve as vice-chairman, and the Federal Minister of Agriculture See afterwards.
It is ironic that the Free Electors candidate was Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber used the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the coup, but then, with an ambitious communal politician, they made a relentlessly short process.
CSU executives are now concentrating all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transitional period, Stoiber will also play an active role, who has hitherto played the backdrop, the former country’s prime minister and former CSU president calling September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber blurred a few witty remarks to the CDU, according to which they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the country’s success in 2005, somehow jointly sets its feet.
According to Merkel, who has struggled to hide her disappointments because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on Berlin’s big coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
Not a single member of the opposition entered the Belarusian parliament on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) the illegalities that occurred during the vote census.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10-million-member country has been lacking opposition for well over a decade, the opposition united under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections had seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had left his seat in the 2006 elections, would "repeat the election with a questionable course."
The ODS has also dropped the previously considered boycott.
Against the backdrop of the opposition expectation was that the anti-Russian politically dependent Belarus - which took a loan to mitigate the impact of the constantly rising Russian imports of natural gas - was increasingly reliant on the anti-Russian politically dependent Belarus - which also contributed to the improvement of the company Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipelines passing through the country, to get to the next country.
The release was previously pointed out that the OSCE emphasised positive shifts in the assessment of the election campaign, rather than shortcomings - for example, banning candidates for a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE flash report on Monday already had reservations about the campaign during which opposition candidates could not actually appear in the press, especially then that the opposition could not be present in the vote counting.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in even minor confrontations with Moscow, as it continues to refuse to recognize Georgia as a separate state, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and not Russia.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevi<0xC4><0x8D> told our letter.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain the case, even though she "was too afraid to let a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament".
Looking at the results of the opposition, he does not plan protests, but rather tries to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition letters in Russia, the distribution is obstructed by local authorities, but I see that the change is supported by more and more people, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which does not consider the most successful of its successes as a result of socialism.
"Because of the debt of the country and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkevi<0xC4><0x8D> said.
Unlike the opposition policy, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words but actions", so the absence of the opposition is nothing more than evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that a swinging door has been introduced upon the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from today onwards, this new measure will work against lubricated people, against those who bite and then go to coffee during working hours.
The news against the lazy was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renate Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
“Rotary doors are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services,” Brunetta said.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency is now opening up.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace will complete the implementation of the Council Presidency in all buildings.
For Masi, “the choice of the swivel door is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
There were no objections on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a common procedure with the workers and cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during business hours; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 more people per year at work."
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
“Its payroll dynamics has doubled over the last 8-10 years with respect to the private sector and is much higher than the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees gathered to reject Brunett’s decree standards in line with a Codacons-supported request.
“While the Minister of Public Administration today presents figures on lower absenteeism at work due to illness,” writes the Consumer Protection Association, “the nation of ‘full lazy people’ is steadily growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in the public administration who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In Tara there will be protests in particular against the exclusion of sickness allowances, which depend on the activities; the extension of the period during which it is possible to check the sick, the period in which the check visits will be carried out, and against other norms included in the new ministerial provisions.
Occupational accidents, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day, 2,500 work accidents occur in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail values confirm that for 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths as a result of work accidents.
These values testify to the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes nearly twice as many deaths as murders.
To rekindle the attention of institutions, social and media about this dramatic problem, today, in all Italian regions, Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day of Work Accident Victims set for the second Sunday in October.
"The alarming data circulated by Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety," President Giorgio Napolitano said in a report sent to President Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli, the National Association for the Deaf and Disabled by Work.
The Head of State expresses his lively admiration for the continuous joint effort for safety at work, for the protection of injured workers, for the assistance to the families of the victims and for the participation of public opinion.
“Naturally, there has been an uproar of ‘enough’, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies that, by their magnitude, provoke unrest in the media and participation of public opinion, but everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating itself in its dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
Of particular importance are the numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education, in order to give young people facing the world of work a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its troubling social severity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
Chamber President Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed "how the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make convincing efforts towards the necessary end of this state."
"As for the work accident data, they seem to be showing some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of work accidents is as alarming as it is," President Anmilu Pietro Mercandelli said.
“We don’t want this ‘slowdown’ to lead to less attention, because it’s the moment the attention stops that the tragedy erupts.
"We believe that there is still too little to be done in general to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
In our opinion, it is necessary to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the training of workers, right from school age.
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and participation of public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes an exceptional social phenomenon.
Mercandelli finally stated that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of compensation rights envisaged for the victims of work and the "removal of supportive care" that the system has been getting into in recent years.
“The goal is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance, because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifting from time to time by the legislator.”
MP3 Players Accused of Exposing Hearing Risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music devices like Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing loss.
According to the European Commission’s announcement published today, which quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health Risks that have emerged recently and have been identified (Csserri) EU in an official report enlarged in Brussels.
“From this scientific view, it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable musical instruments for at least five years, more than an hour a day a week and keep the instrument at a high volume, are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
“I am concerned that so many young people, who often use portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels, may unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” Kuneva said.
"Scientific findings - the leader continues - pose a clear risk and need to be responded quickly.
Most importantly, we need to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We need to continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding, so that they become fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists - concluded the EU executive - confirm that there is a need to worry, and now the European Commission, together with other members and parties who have raised the problem, will examine what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise."
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of the EU states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time are at risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno leaves the Commission free for the future of the capital
We will start today, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will draw up manuals for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemanna.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas - he wants to emphasize Alemanno - It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political arbitrators who remain the Giunta e General Council.
It’s not about any exchange of functions, but just about trying to have some place to work on a big project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved, because these institutions must have an exact deadline.
In June, we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work carried out by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome."
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as the Attali Commission's proposals are, and I am sure of that in Rome, their contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics is made up of everyday problems and urgencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that "this Commission is neither a futile enterprise nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roman citizens will not even cost the euro and will serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic outline as a starting point, neither definitive nor immovable, so that our city can be allowed to rise authentically to the level it urgently needs, and to think with a united spirit about its future."
A future that, the mayor of Rome specifies, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look far beyond" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe".
Obama? The first anti-American president. We already know why
One well-known U.S. president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.”
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as a private citizen today) with the enemy of Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
One lady from Miami wrote on the website: “This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he’s going to get to the top position of a nation that had two governors and five black senators everywhere!”
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and don't answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the southern United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the election booth, we know very well who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mentality, which remained skeptical until the last minute, comes to the fore.
“Say what you want, and in the end, we’ll take care of who to check, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama had won, we would have left America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of a black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for the Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, for most of Bush, Iraq has become a weakness.
Whoever takes the place of Georgie W will have to perform a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapse was felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and assumptions about the future.
Nowadays, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, respondents did not openly say they had less concerns about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put newspapers together, are a huge problem.
According to the interviewed journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to be fundamentally changed as it is understood by the general public.
American journalists are permeated by a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and senior executives are convinced that journalism on a national scale is going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
Larger publishing houses are making their way to the Internet, which many view as a "killer" of the press.
“Economic pressure,” as reported by journalists, has increased by as much as 79 percent.
Five hundred journalists interviewed said they resorted to technology in the hope that it would “do something good for their journalism.”
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms—that is, executives—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "job security" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're at 30%.
When it comes to "certain work" related to staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and so it’s a matter of taking or leaving.
Managers almost always receive huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month besides paying pensions and insurance.
As for the holidays, the argument becomes complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It is just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA IS IN THE GROTTAFERRAT
The president of the Second Chamber of the Criminal Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the filing of a real estate businessman, Daniel Coppola, who asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-offer in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released from house arrest last week, which was turned into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur could change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which he spoke out pm) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
A few days ago, the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan presented to the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, more temperate, conducive to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which, on the other hand, leads the world from conservative to non-conservative.
The soul that arrogantly manifested itself in the vote that I spoke of at the beginning.
But this just quoted thing is just an example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West and perhaps not only here.
Both in the United States and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of phenomena that have been in the incubation for a long time, which are solidified in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival of the market, the double category of the State-power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, are mainly involved.
At the same time, this has created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families, who are, among others, voters.
In short, the crisis seems economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be substantially out of the question or that it has nothing to add: the European Union has given clear evidence, which is divided as always between different interests and different national strategies, and which cannot decide on a single common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules and, above all, the allocation of funds: when we get into distress, only the states have the economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
And also own the necessary resources and powers to use them: two resources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the national-state element, is, after all, in complete harmony with the growing importance that the latest economic progress is trying to attribute to one factor closely related to it: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the web, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finances were already destined to rule the world, from nothing did we realize that our future would have to go with them.
All things, who would say this, can be transported from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a bounded space, a territory.
So who becomes their ruler certainly has much more cards in his sleeve than who is not, and who has the bad luck to live in a place without grain, without oil, and without water.
I'm getting to the second novelty, which, however, predicts evil.
Whoever speaks of territory, state, government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Given the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be emerging.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, the request for someone who can handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditation towards existing leadership, especially economic ones, has proved equally unsuitable and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
Indeed, it seems to be spreading more and more among the broad masses of the population of beliefs than that their actions should be the same as the ideas of the still popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elites have already overcome their time and are indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply nourishes one branch of the subterranean consortium, but a strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political order of the United States manifests itself in the sudden electoral "rebellion" or in the unexpected changes of collective moods in the last and the most recent consortium, from the consortium to the consortium.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have more and more problems to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from now on, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the sweat is growing, the economic crisis is spreading again.
Before this, it would be exaggerated to talk about a permanent"mass uprising".
But we certainly can’t say that it means having your eyes open.
Super glue for walking on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
The scientists managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall using a sticker of just 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use a special structure of carbon called carbon dwarf tubes.
“The adhesive base can be imagined as a series of tubes laid out like an organized pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to provide the perfect adhesion.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time “simply sticks off the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps walking on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers are thinking of far less fascinating uses as a connection of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aeronautical space engineering .
No superheroes yet.
FURTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scientists introduced a adhesive formed from microfibers as hair that cleans itself from dust by moving it over the surface to keep it perfectly adhesive.
Medications: never with juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medications, their intake will change the increase or decrease in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, highlighted the risks of juices and juices, both ready and fresh, in combination with the intake of certain medications, at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs to a toxic level.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS AT RISK – The Italian Medical Agency announced this in an information bulletin two years ago and urged doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to watch what they drink when taking medications such as Diazepam or Methadone.
GRAPEFRUIT ONLY – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects suppressed by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruby, director of the pharmacology department at the State University of Milan, said: "Such discoveries are usually immediately announced to a variety of international and national pharmacy agencies, which may arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative lists of medicines you get and if you come across something unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification.”
The Nobel Prize in Economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenian who teaches at Priceton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration’s foreign, economic and political actions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days Enron crashed, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of consequences on U.S. history, much more important than the first.
A prediction which has caused little controversy and which has been blamed on him for years, but which has proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and shocked at the speed at which collapses like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank’s Executive Committee, Krugman is a “great economist”, but also a popularizer who has a “very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration”.
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft»
It’s Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more famous Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteers, controlled by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various novelties: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window will be added another, far more significant, as the compatibility for the standard for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support of the new format.
Emphasis is also placed on working with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as one that allows you to reduce the dimensions of a PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for transferring electronically, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphics model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble the typical Adobe graphics format and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has gained many improvements within the application programs: in excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program, each collaborator is assigned one color to the comments to be more clearly identified in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on moving some of the features of Open Office to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to reset the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it was added to the English version, which is located on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation CD can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the topic of freelancing can be a hub for expansion in homes, the Open Office business area is the focus of the package, and it can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a table processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and when we consider that to date we are almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of the new version it is possible that this expected number can even be surpassed.
Kohl's results are also positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: this is Aarhus Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third-ranked and the winner of the T-shirt of the best climber.
The report was quoted by the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth rider positive on Cera, Epo third generation, after Italians Riccard Riccco and Leonard Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood samples are among the ones that have been performed in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analysis confirms the positive on Ceru, Austrian will lose the third place on the Tour and will have to face the stipulated two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl’s positive attitude to the third-generation EPO is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced to the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government about the result.
26-year-old Austrian placed on the ranks of winners behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, he also won the scored t-shirt of the best climber.
Immigrants: NEW YORK TIMES IS TARGET, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy, as a country of emigrants, has only turned into a preferred destination for immigrants in the last home.
It turns a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So they ask in a long article by the New York Times, which devoted this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and began the case of young Abdul William Guibre, a Burkina Faso native, who was killed last month in Milan because he stole a crab.
This case makes visible what the New York Times defines as the “paradox of the north”: the northern regions are at the same time where “more integration and more work” is registered, but also “the country’s strongest anti-immigrant mindset and the strongest support for the Northern League”.
To confirm rising tensions between Italy and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation demanded by Lego, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of expensive rentals - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research of Sunia, the unions for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"If it has already reached such dimensions that entire layers of students have lost the right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear - explains the head of the office for the studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in this city, the high demand for the prices of the students has deformed the market."
In most cases, the lease offers contain several violations: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without a limited lease, associated sub-rentals.
Sunji needs an exceptional intervention that could regulate prices thanks to a tax review.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, one bed is needed about 450 euros, per single room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (zone Bande Nere) through the average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) up to a maximum of 900 (zone Vitoriat).
In Florence, one bed costs on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the university, it is necessary to pay 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 euros in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) want about 600 euros per single room, 450 bed in a double room.
Values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, for a bed it is necessary 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is renting for students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally one other anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they want for foreign students, compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities are interrupting historic halls
The cinematographic historical halls are closed in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without a cinema is as blind as a face without eyes."
The picture offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centers, but also in rural towns.
The process of restricting cinemas, the birth of large multisales in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monosales in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the features of a true cultural crime.
"It's like losing a friend, a friend, with whom we shared a piece of the road and a lot of emotions," feels the director of New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won the Oscar to Tornator twenty years ago, and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes and Cannes.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, the doors of 316 cinemas of the traditional tip have closed, and the highest bill was paid mainly by the halls in the most important cities: about 10 mins in Florence, about 5 mins in Boer, about 6 mins in Florence, about 9 mins in Ne Milan.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with a loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, are these three Italian regions, which registered the highest number of new cinema multisales: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian process has evolved irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President of Anecu, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about the inadequate grant to the fund for the benefit of the operators: the previous public debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a disgrace that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would require between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year to support the sector.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which decided to find a starting point by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in the historical centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned norms are steps of tax relief in favour of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to go to the restricted traffic zone and will have special prices to stop at and at some parking lots.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures."
However, it is certain that in order to counteract the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to found "New Cinema Paradiso", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I’ve lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk past the already closed Rialto or Quirinale in Nazionale Street, where I shared so much emotion that I didn’t have to look at the dust-black inscriptions, I turn to the other side.”
Link between politician and mafia group 'ndrangheta, mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal election to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The charges brought by the Directorate against the Mafia in Calabria against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioie Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and mayor of Rosarna, Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external co-operation with the mafia organization, are serious.
In the irons also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the nominee of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," state prosecutors wrote, when two local authorities expressed willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
“In this way, they would allow the mafia group to officially enter the city authorities and facilitate the already vast possibilities of control and management of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld are a lot in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of ‘ndranghets, heroes who are still spotless’.
The arrests of this morning follow the arrests of July last year, with which police showed that the Mafia group Piromalli had received a final intervention.
Since the end of April last year - the Gioia Tauro City Council had been dissolved since 1991, the reason being the supposed link between organized crime and local administration - local politicians had been deprived of functions in municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the leader of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of dissolution was elected head of the right-wing coalition after a narrower election in May.
He was yelling at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the municipal council to be dissolved.
He called on then-Deputy Secretary of the Interior Marco Minniti for accountability and accused him of conceiving everything for political reasons, but the judges in the detention order signed this morning explain that the mafia group has even gone so far as to request a change to the project.
In further interrogations ordered against Dal Torriona, the public prosecutors write, the "willingness to move the claims of the businessman, the representatives of some larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli, and to adapt the public administration elections to the interests of the mafia group."
When energy is born from waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless bearing that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and is now being explored by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are the new sources of inexhaustible energy that the eyes of colossus like Chevron are now trying to reach out to these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went aside. But now ecological organizations and new increases in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the movement of the waves of the sea.
This amount would be twice as much energy as is currently produced in nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are also currents and tides and tides.
The giants are attacking.
The company that invested in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of investing in marine energy, more and more companies are investing in marine energy rather than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” said a spokesman for a company connected to the U.S. oil colossus, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal, “and they’re thinking about working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project to use marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are following the trail of marine energy, and the amounts invested so far, although not in detail, are showing increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
Currently, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not appear to cause major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are interconnected.
The force of the waves that moves up and down with the buoys is changed by means of cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure rotates the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy is brought to the shore by submarine cables.
At the moment, there are four such facilities in the project phase, which are only awaiting federal approval and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for the shopping center and parking lot using six offshore turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of the water during the tidal and outflow causes the turbines to rotate, which the generator feeds with this rotational movement.
Verdant said that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential of tide and outflow, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although this is an inconsistent factor, tide and tide are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
States such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
