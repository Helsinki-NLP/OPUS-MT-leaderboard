Republican strategy of resistance to re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policies with the need to fight counterfeiting in the elections.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that cases of electoral falsification in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is for sure: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that make the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon took on a new dimension after the November 2010 election, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register an elector on the day of the declaration of will and deprive citizens of the right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to spread the practice to other states.
For the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to present photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have an identity card with a photo issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Students who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use a photo ID card issued by their educational institution in several states.
But the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mainly for Republicans, to use the credentials issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship for voting.
This is the first time such a requirement has been introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the voting of Latin Americans.
It is believed that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on the day of voting in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those wishing to register.
This restriction did not go without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, a campaign to register voters helped list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent drop in new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the state’s total electorate.
The same thing happened with Latin Americans as well.
Representing only 11% of voters, they made up 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike the whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, only 46% of those who voted were early.
Of course, Democrats and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has partially limited the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID.
However, the new rules that have entered into force will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Democrat critics condemn the bias of the laws that have been passed, seeing in them an obvious focus on influencing the results of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electorate to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Screening for prostate cancer: to pass a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives erroneous, false-negative, and sometimes false-positive results that lead to useless medical intervention.
For men, and so reluctantly undergoing a dispensary, there is something to doubt even more.
Passing the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among groups of subjects, so the data obtained are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, found different levels of mortality in those patients who underwent screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that metastases were 30-40% more likely to occur in those who did not undergo screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking a test starting at age 50, or at age 40, if one of the immediate relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and slow-moving.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without the mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long term, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease starts to progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly, we accurately determine the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
So, I would still recommend taking the test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not you need to pass this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess all the pros and cons of passing a PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle-recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one smoked more, that number would rise to at least 50 percent,” said Andre Bollier, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
This is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to human health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Bolière.
Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Wes
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancers, the esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the association said in a statement.
Food (food)
The association also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
In too many amounts, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can harm the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” the association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduced risk of developing prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
There is also no complete clarity in assessing the impact of vitamin D on cancer development.
However, Mr. Bollio emphasizes that it is important to discuss your anxiety and family history with your doctor.
"Analysis does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, a report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused a real stir — and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much or little.
In addition, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted within the Standard Model—our best, or at least “least imperfect,” description of the nature and behavior of matter—but which has not previously been detected experimentally.
But physicists are not entirely sure that this is the Higgs boson.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although for complete certainty some data is not yet enough.
Let’s imagine, however, that this is about the Higgs boson, because the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and let’s see what that means.
There is one absolutely inevitable law in this world that two things cannot end up in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise you will harm yourself.
But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that there is also one law of this nature: the Pauli exception principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" of their common characteristics, is the "state" of the
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
In the other, there are bosons, a disgusting gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything – at least this principle, which means that they can be quietly in the same place at the same time.
As the site (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory reports, these bosons, in turn, are divided into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and "particles of force", by means of which the main forces of nature are distributed and to which in some way the bosons belong.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it’s because of one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or “particle of light,” which is the “courier” of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle that has an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disrupts” the electromagnetic field in that particular place, about like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and, therefore, one of the bosons of "power transmitters".
A more stable field.
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken."
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very and very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like the one exploited in the CERN – the Big Hadron Collider, which is a 27-kilometer-diameter ring! – is needed to achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never be kept in the refrigerator.
Likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like the photon, by the way) do not.
So, what "can" all these studies bring, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to sense the discrepancy between the results of observations and the forecasts of the SM.
In addition, some of them are passionately eager for such a discrepancy to be discovered, since the slightest discrepancy can open the door to the "new physics" and close some of the holes of the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
But no such differences have yet been found in the CERN.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the everyday life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it does not exist.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell’s laboratories could not even guess what revolution their work would bring.
They predicted their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at the Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered a "laboratory gauge".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can be found for the toolkit accompanying the study.
For example, the same Billiard Boyle during his optical studies in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose at all, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... <0x7C> "Debt"
A delicate end-of-life issue was recently discussed in the Commission for a Decent Death in Quebec.
The debate is expected to resume soon, and a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
"Debt" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Monterrey.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from the inside, gave him a two-year delay.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, lying in bed between life and death in Victor-Gadbu's palliative care shelter in White, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own and even eating on your own.
Sitting at the table where there is an appetizing lunch, he surrenders and agrees to be helped to eat.
He is cheerful, even able to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before ordinary death.
“My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"In our lifetimes, we are taught that a man should urinate while standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Viktor-Gadboy shelter.
Regressing to the condition of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
“It all depends on a person’s ability to accept decay,” he says.
Since, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events occur at the height of this decline.
Patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadboi’s palliative care facility are all cancer patients.
The prognosis gives them a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses no longer provide assistance, called “medical.”
Ms. A., 89 years old, is most afraid to die "in consciousness from suffocation".
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything else in life,” she says, before letting her wear a breathing mask.
She is still waiting in the coming days for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
In the Viktor-Gadboy shelter, a group of volunteers provide body care and nutrition assistance.
This is palliative care, which remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
This is very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life goes on in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it is physical, emotional or emotional comfort.
To the dying we will agree to provide mouthwashes of brandy or pepsi, regardless of what he asks.
We no longer force diabetics to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
In the morning, his son drank this beer in the legs of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as well as patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
In the shelter of Victor-Gadboi, not a single day is like the previous.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, lying on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old young man tragically dies, surrounded by parents, his wife and two young children and has tried everything to survive.
“In the last six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboi shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbow Hospice and the Palliative Care Society at the Greater Montreal Home, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is this big gap in Quebec’s health care system that has led many palliative care professionals to fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and assisting suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the Palliative Care Lights, Dr. Balfour Mountain and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, has been circulating and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid patients just want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists try to save patients to the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
The hopes for survival of Ellen Richard were already minimal when she stopped her exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was stopping the fight.
She told me that my days were numbered.
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Society of Palliative Care at the Greater Montreal Home, said patients are not susceptible to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of his death, either from time to time or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we are unaware of these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who do not manage to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Patients who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to have euthanasia,” it means “I want to have it easier.”
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec City
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia say day after day what they know about a colossal “system” that encompasses the construction industry, civil servants, politicians and trade unionists.
The “industry” was very expensive for Quebec’s taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“I wonder how this system breaks down after all the funds have been used,” jokes Jacques Duchenne, a deputy and former Montreal police chief.
It was thanks to him that the scandal broke out in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation of the bureaucratic crimes related to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charet, very reluctantly agreed.
The Duchenne Report has established a direct link between industry, political party funding and corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Department of Transportation alone would have retained $1 billion in contracts,” he stressed, if some had restrained their instincts to take a share.
Charbonno’s commission “already displaced two mayors,” he adds, hoping it will be able to “discover the schemes behind individual figures.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, which included an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Hammer", which after 2009 forced the Montreal "waste cartel", to stop the overvalue of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out over the past few weeks, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard Markot, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn - Gilles Vaiyancourt, recently resigned from the post of mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing public orders.
In addition, the official indictment was filed by several Montreal road service engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal to a mafia-related broker who, in turn, transferred money to Mayor Gerald Trump's United Montreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito ran with money to the right and left. He transferred more than $88,000 (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to various parties in the province, mostly liberals, who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he was illegally raising funds for the former deputy prime minister of the Liberal Party, Natalia Normando.
Sewerage contracts in which the value was overstated
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked without fail.
Zhil Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, to golf tournaments, restaurants, for hockey matches and bribes in total for $ 736,000.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted that they were getting on their feet, overburdening the bills by 30-40% with the help of fake supplements.
Then one mayoral party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trump of intentionally closing his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget that filled party cash registers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Trump resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to sound alarm.
The mayor of the district of Riviera de Prairie in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal plot bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of Dirty Money in Election Campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, she will “pull behind a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of a system that is stuffed with ants to stop gangrene and identify the culprits.”
She describes this process as “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of wound cleansing, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of dubious practices.
How we clean up the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchenne, for his part, notes that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is particularly concerned about the role of “election officials who knew about this scheme” but were not involved in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in funding the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: “I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties up to $100, but he said this would not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of granting public contracts and financing of parties: "We cannot go down below; by boldly looking at the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy."
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchenne calls on those who laugh to look into their own courtyard ...
"It's not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have achieved an extraordinary scale in PSG.
How would you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up next to them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
During the game, it’s easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not on fire.
From the very beginning at the preliminary training center at the NIF in Clerfontein until my arrival in St. Etienne, I always took a step forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer, it is not new to play games of a very high level.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me is craving to be on the level and stand out as much as possible.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my positioning.
He is assisted by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the owner of the estate?
Sure. Yeah.
Ancelotti respects all the technical staff.
Today, he is unmatched in the Premier League and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I walked away from a whole series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took the place of leader from us.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have effectively qualified in the one-eighth final.
What is the goal of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can be.
We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, ahead of Porto, to be able to accept a rematch in the one-eighth final.
Can PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate positions for the long term.
That's not the case today.
Financially, the PSG has the means to make this project a reality.
Not taking the title in the First League, like last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship.
Last season we were close to that.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have joined the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
It is normal that we expect a lot from us, given how much has been invested and what players we have.
We are fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Trudeau and we are still found to criticize, of course, it is a bit upsetting.
We wonder what people are expecting from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can respond to today’s challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has been unable to pass in an eighth final for two seasons, although they have also spent a huge amount of money!
Taking into account the amounts invested, we represented you by 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who weren’t at the top last season, were “awakened” by this new PSG.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we have won.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, what if they say that there is some kind of "Golden Dependence".
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores many goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is a First League star.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-class star.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's disappointing.
I really wanted to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from spending some time playing.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Today, I’m able to play good qualifying matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in the qualifying team for the World Cup.
He’s a tough coach, he’s close to the players and he inspires to win.
What was Laurent Blanc?
But I don't want to compare.
“Blanc has achieved his goal, he has qualified us in the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham brings the Blues to Brazil.
Is a well-deserved draw (1-1) torn out on October 16 in Spain a fundamental match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone was fighting for everyone.
"Before this shock in Spain, there have been no such matches in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties with commission fees for processing them.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, the political vision is clear: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is simultaneously a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows file exchange between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin’s exchange rate, peaking at $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, dropped five months later to $2, before returning to about $10 today (courses are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world’s exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, published in October, was interested in this system.
It describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competiting with the dollar or the euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to promote a video game, which are earned during the game or which can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both bookkeepers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, similar to an e-mail.
Only for each new payment the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information pertaining to this transaction is signed electronically, using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Due to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It passes through the solution of the mathematical problem sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, receives the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the hash phase of a file, that is, the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers “take” a new transaction and add a number to it before “hashing” them all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction is thus inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user would very quickly (in less than ten minutes) wish to pay twice with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network – and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the prize is regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by one hundred million, which leaves a reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites providing Bitcoin services were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noaza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes real-money payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
“Giant sales” were announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmkvist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noaza, another author of the manual on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, making it cheaper.
The owner has better control over his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, Pierre Noaza clarifies, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
In its report, the ECB envisages, by the way, to review the various risks that are considered increased today, if this system is successful.
We have left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. should follow suit at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not relying only on us.
We were mainly affected by Afghan peasants, whom we considered terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was in the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, they are sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be there as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijraab base, which I observed from the heights of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggles between different groups.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the peasantry in which they were surpassed by al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved these days.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women subordinate.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into merchants seizing state land to resell it under construction to repatriates returning from Iran and Pakistan, using huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, have not even fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have succeeded with American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
The public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to secure the jobs of these young people, who will not want to return either to the obscenity of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that look everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who led the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore provincial wives who would not obey the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to some extent, like Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting in the 1950s and even earlier, is dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that Western countries were there only to capture them.
Without energy to recycle iron ore or copper on the spot, without means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no extraction of minerals.
The Chinese have almost left the Messi Aynak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province’s largest employers.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, should restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: lyceum for girls, for boys, French language faculty at the university, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "conquer hearts and minds" and to fulfill the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the service of "military-civil activities" under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to the upswing of numerous public activities.
These works, with the intensive involvement of the local workforce, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing the area of arable land.
What will we leave in memory of ourselves, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural works from local communities in the province of Capisa.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which the farmers want, as they told me, we need to provide them with a little non-military support that would be well controlled and treated directly.
Difficult Births of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a new risky move by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he decided to play wa-bank.
Surprised, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
It has been almost two years since Egypt relied on the preliminary text, which had been amended several times, which weakened institutional stability and led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic delusion”, continuing to “violate this word” and “neglect the right”.
In the camp of his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce the intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging across the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Times.
The call for an accelerated vote resembles an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I retain my extraordinary powers”, which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals did not respond to the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to express their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, spare members, were rushed to be added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day had arisen around... the time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was incorrectly tuned.
The text, which was still voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Object of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained the same as the 1971 article of the Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the primary source of law."
Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would allow for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrite,” the liberals respond, who see this as a mere pyre.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomiere, this is alarming, because "people called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can observe the birth of theocracy.”
Many liberals, moreover, are excited by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not wizards, but people with university education, some were trained in the French system," says Alexis Blois, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "around Article 220 there may be ambiguity, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, cf. ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent civil judges are to make decisions on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is subject to criticism because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they have been significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another issue is the authority of the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will not take place in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Neither will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite the requests of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider to be detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy has been maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles talk about protecting women anymore, says Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will go out on the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy places, Pup of the Earth and the sea from the brine
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the primacy of nature.
The AIF has outlined five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Let us worship the holy places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who enters this “dome” receives God’s grace.
And Galilee is the place of the miracles of Jesus: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before his disciples and after his resurrection.
Most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Way of Sorrow or the Cross Path of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antony - Pretoria - where there was a court, and through the streets of the Old City leads to the Temple of the Sepulchre of the Lord on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of Anointing and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pup of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected at the place where, according to Christian legend, a tree was grown, from which they made a cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place for the Jews - the Wall of Lamentation, left of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave here notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Make a trip in a vertical manner
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained from the secret refuge from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on steep cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are passionate about mountaineering can reach them.
The rest are taken to this historic summit by a cable car lift.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
There is a shuttle bus at the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, pagan gods supposedly lived on top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You don’t get to visit everyone in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is also worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition are widely represented paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Acco, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which represents several halls of ancient Turkish baths with paintings of visitors and bankers of the time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dalí and Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section - the children's memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are waving.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Healing
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and bathes there all year round.
By the way, this is the most extraordinary sea in the world is at the lowest point on the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a salt, which easily keeps floating even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around it are unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - rapeseed, and healing dirt, and to treat health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, to bring in order the shaken.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are stored by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the city of Jaffa on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom here they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you hit the walls on the street of "your" sign, Fortune will be favored.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries in a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can roam the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist on the note
When traveling to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population knows the Russian language.
The money for the trip is better to take not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa - the only subway line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with transfers within 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop working.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, there is only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, peel-free fish and dishes that combine milk with meat.
There is a wide selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste humus, a variety of sauces, balls of hammered nut - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israel.
But there are a lot of fed cats that walk on their own.
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murleys love crowded places and do not refuse meals.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And renting a bicycle will cost 15 shekels. per day.
Tickets to museums cost on average 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the travel and rest came from citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" to Moscow will lead: migrants will save money on language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue that the law on compulsory language testing will, fraudsters have already appeared in the country, trading "lip" certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose is to earn money to support the families that remain in the homeland.
As of December 1, a law has entered into force, according to which every migrant worker will be obliged to pass an exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and utilities, households and retail.
However, over time, the FMS promises, tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
At the same time, it will be necessary to surrender not only the language, but also the Russian history and the basics of the legislation.
Language proficiency will have to be confirmed both for obtaining and for extending the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the state language.
They are not subject to the law and people who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of examination points will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of the Friendship of Nations, the MSU, the SPbSU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; already more than 160 such centers have opened in Russia.
The initiative on introducing testing was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the press the question: what does this actually mean?
What will change the compulsory knowledge of the language for both Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, according to the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the Russian FMS mission in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, who do not have a medical certificate.
Without understanding the language, the future migrant is doomed to face unfaithful people who, under the guise of help, will throw him a “guide” into a scary narrow barrack, where he and dozens of others will spend months without food and documents, squeezing 12-14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland they are promised one thing, and on arrival they are deceived, they take passports, they do not pay the promised salary," - confirms the head of the main department of labor migration of the Ministry of Labor of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't fight me, man!
However, while many citizens of Central Asian republics who are going to earn money in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the country in which they aspire, but also write hard on their own.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as their trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even an intelligent primary education.
After all, their families have nothing even to feed the children, not to mention, to dress them decently, to shoes and to equip them for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys go to earnings at the first opportunity.
It’s hard if they don’t know the language, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inadequate."
However, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders note one important point.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Alien Entrance Banned"
Many of the visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But the fake registration can be done quickly and for only half a thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly fake documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"One hundred, two for cigarettes, tea", - shared with journalists citizen of Tajikistan Umad Huschadamov.
"Fly, don't rush, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it was found that not only migrant registration documents are fake.
Several "lip" certificates of passing language tests have already been confiscated by FMS staff.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got to the new owners not in vain: each of the migrants, who hoped to make it easier for themselves to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two times more expensive than the official testing procedure: it will cost a migrant worker three thousand.
The main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the "steps" can not be simply bought, both the authorities and human rights defenders agree.
So far, the authorities can promise guest workers who have not been able to successfully pass the test from the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legal weapons is extremely low.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to tighten the law against the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: to press gunfire at weddings when there were no victims, and the massacre organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which seven people were killed.
Police want to ban the wearing of trauma in public places and raise the age at which you can get a gun license - from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Countering Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, and promised that amendments to the arms law will be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by “turning nuts.”
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public small-scale organizations - demand to abandon the "senseless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian service of the BBC forensic lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms, registered in the bodies of internal affairs, while in the same period alone, 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are sure that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not allow the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to be controlling the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired Colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site accepting orders for weapons
The first is an "army or military footprint", i.e. a weapon that was stolen during combat operations in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were drawn by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapon" - stolen by criminals from representatives of the force structures.
Baranets explains that this includes both stolen from police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns are being sold from military warehouses.
There have been frequent explosions in many military warehouses.
"There are proven versions that some of the burns were made specifically to cover up the shortage," the ex-military said.
According to Baranza, weapons manufacturers are importing their products.
“Now there are private weapons factories that cannot withstand competition in the international market and throw weapons from under the floor into the black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
There is a lot of guns and machine guns coming from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own production, sometimes artisanal, and the mafia formed, which organized the flow," - explains the ex-military.
Where'd the gun come from?
Experts estimated the approximate share of each of the sources of illegal arms deliveries to the "black" market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Management Design.
The experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, the criminological literature and the open data of the portals on the topic of weapons.
Most of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were found there “by officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of production of weapons, 5% belongs to "black archaeology".
A salesman of one of the arms stores, who asked not to give his name, assures that the weapons found by black miners have not been bought for a long time - too old.
Most often, as he says, after the new party, the vendors go to the military warehouse.
Through a flag, a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
He is discharged, handed over through the shutter.
“He takes her to the city and sells her for 900 euros a piece with two stores,” he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when a plan for the detection of crimes is burning, they conduct control purchases from illegal arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, in the blogs, until a comrade responded, who offered to come to the platform "God", where there will be a person who will take me to the "corner" where we will trade.
I only knew the price of the gun there.
Viktor Baranets Military Reviewer
To get a gun I need a friend who has an outlet, - says the sales consultant. - I have such a friend, but I am not sure of him.
There are vendors in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to pass on that daughter's tooth fell off."
I'm even getting a couple of cassets right now through a person I'm sure of.
He delivers them only to me because he knows I won't give them away.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article about it for publication.
Schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album with "anything."
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the soldier.
According to Baranza, the buyer is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, am not just buying - we go with the seller to the forest, there we put a target.
“I’m given the opportunity to shoot, and when I’m sure the weapon hits well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet point to sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
You do not need any documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money", - they write in the advertising cap on the site "Buy a war pistol or a machine gun".
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will they sell to minors?
"Without a license, of course", - asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"Buy TT.Moscow" - laconically formulates the request "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of fake sites and wishing to buy combat weapons crest with a shovel.
People walk like hungry fish to feed, and then mining coal in Siberia

I have heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send a photo and an instruction where the weapons are hidden,” said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the public organization “Right to Weapons”.
Viktor Baranets claims that by leaving the application on the site, you can remain unarmed and get behind bars.

“People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they mine coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
For the purchase of illegal small arms, experts estimate, it is possible to invest in the amount of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Right to Arms", the pistol Makarov can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official statistics of the department, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of detected facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
U.S. workers strike for fast food and supermarkets
Through the work at the box office "McDonalds" passes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendes and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Until then, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth shaft or is destined to exhale in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages that ordinary Walmart employees and fast food systems receive, the goal of the protesters is to create trade union organizations in them.
Until this sector of the economy is almost covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “Black Friday,” when an orgy of cheap sales plunged into America, capturing millions of people and sometimes accompanied by quarrels.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketted along with unions and left-wing activists the stores of a corporation whose goods are intended for people of modest and middle income.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart employees only work at home.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods at a discount in part because it pays its employees little.
The latter also complain of severe working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
Black Friday shareholders demanded an increase in salary and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
To a typical Walmart worker who gets $9.5 an hour, this spending is not in his pocket, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than she’s spending on her salary right now.
If Walmart completely shifts wage growth to the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they will spend about $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters note that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause the corporation the slightest damage.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers produced nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
A spokesman for the corporation, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the Huffington Post that the jobs had left a total of “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the protest was just “another piarist trick” by the union.
"Free cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they weren’t targeted by Walmart department stores (they’re not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore they’re not here yet), and McDonald’s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and he doesn't pay you for honest work!
Jumeen Williams, member of the New York City Council
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are increasing it over time, but not much, and on average, their regular employees get $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one earns less in this city.
How you can live in New York for that kind of money is inconceivable to me.
Once, almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked behind their counters after school, while living with their parents, went through McDonald's.
Few people have seen this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I’m constantly bumping into interviews with McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal hangs a comment, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to start children if you do not know what you will feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing trade union activists with whistleblowers and layoffs.
Administration, on the other hand, rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is difficult for a trade union to cover fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary flow of personnel.
Disagreement
Noisy protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day, a rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which featured several local Democrat politicians, in particular, a member of the city council, Jumeen Williams, who said: "McDonalds" says that he will give you even billions of dollars for it.
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we must join forces in support of fast food workers so that they achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!”
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were fast food workers, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will generate the flame of mass movement.
"While cheating the brain turns out to be average"
Popular among fans of modern technologies, the topic of augmented reality has recently been perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First in the summer at its annual conference, Google showed the current model, and then in November it became known that the application for the corresponding patent was filed by Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D-technology at the Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge, Sharam Izadi, it follows that for the scientists of this company, the glasses - the stage has passed.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell me, in general terms, what is your research team doing?
“We are dealing with human-machine interaction, but we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity in mass is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes pumpkins in them with a finger.
We want to look five to ten years ahead and anticipate dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What's ahead of us?
“Although Kinect has moved the interaction to the physical level, much is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very much.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projection.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It definitely can not be called a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you do not always want to inform others about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, for managing devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about the big ones, but about those little ones, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were taken not by the camera of the device, but by a wristband, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future behind a mixed type of control, for example, gesture+voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand you this jar of soda?
You will tell and show at the same time.
- I usually just say.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or can not at the moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future, we will mainly have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
“If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth, or something else?
“In principle, the current generation is something that we can draw from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 rpm.
But it’s not megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers.
That is, you need to remember not only about the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed and the number of frames per second are also very important.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 rpm is frankly low, especially for gestures.
Steven Bettyses from our Redmond Laboratory made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I would have been very useful in my work the equivalent of such a device, but it does not require touch, so that the frames per second were larger.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the other is a receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, a normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or to increase it by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how this will help in the three-dimensional determination of the position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time walking around, holding a smartphone in his hands is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be "transient" augmented reality, when based on the cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, projection display and so on.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
“Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: no tactile feedback!
My hands can't feel anything!
What are the answers your team is preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth could be the addition of tactile sensations.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is the use of a second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
It registers the clicks very well!
But there's also technology that really aims to give these "images in the air" tactile — for example, interfering with several directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where your finger is — it makes you feel, but while it's very weak — as if you're swollen on your pillows.
There are bracelets on the wrists, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Did you try to fool the brain?
To make him think that he feels what he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that has to be fought for a long time - how to force a person who is physically in a very limited space, to believe that he is going on an open, almost infinite - we work on the concepts of treadmills (not at all such as in clubs), moving balls, and platforms.
While deceiving the brain is average, work is still very much for many years.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to the researcher – many things in an absolutely primitive state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg Avant-Garde", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
In this top list have already come bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the epic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man, dressed in all red, who meets both at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then at fashionable gatherings and vernissages.
Cyril Miller’s paintings are always gathered by crowds of spectators wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the strictly Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets, causing a smile from the citizens, raising the mood of everyone.
Recently, he took a charmer and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around the city in all red, not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer who looks and looks.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society.
Although in society everything that is almost not gray, causes aggression and excitement of a bad property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized this was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and the new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gazonevshchyna, which led to the "Pushkin-10", and there was no more wave.
It throws me into the theater, clothes, music, in all genres except the word.
It was important for me to be at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995 I occupied the territory on Pushkin-10, and until there were repairs, there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, a house of St. Petersburg bohemian art.
Many were born there: NOMs, Tequila Jazz, I remember how the string was brought with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
String and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in a tight jersey, among them was the now-fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programs before the Hali-Gali times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and the basic education and upbringing he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboedov" - these are the echoes of the Art-Clinic.
That's where our employees and regulars went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the award was "People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named, my culmination ended.
In the new times, working according to the old rules is uncomfortable, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable way of life.
"Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and acuity.
I'll have a program exhibition, "The Russian Museum in the Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, and now being so is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is blurred, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian disguise in order.
Now on the clothes meet, focusing on the external mechanic, not on the internal person.
Or maybe you can't put your hand in his face and spit it in his face.
And the deception will be removed with the help of disguise.
And we've seen you play the city charmer recently, and a cultural city must have a hero like that.
Who, like me, should be.
Is it possible that commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be neat, tactile, sweet.
Disintegration of cultures.
People used to fight in packs, Bohemian loved one, simple the other.
Now everyone has broken down into microcommunities, now it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to make everyone like me.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov comes for a few thousand!
- He's getting the brooches, the sex and social sphere is working.
And on a cultural basis, 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and in the end, less management, money, everything will smell.
I have fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to spoil the earned.
When I was young, I wrote such paintings that one collector had them hanging on a wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that usually end.
Nowadays, concepts are often confused.
They say: a spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, grown up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, giving up money for painting.
I'm for that culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official from culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings, everything was not so, the kings may not understand very well in culture, but they understood that it is necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are pushed back, because we need higher experts who will correctly assess these experts and give them the way.
Now the taste buds are flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are such artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is ground.
And on our stones, art is hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, that’s wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of tonic.
We need to make fashion art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented on the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Birth in Space
The land is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board are sent in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue our species in the conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered, at least hypothetically.
“It’s Venus and Mars,” said Vladimir Surdin, a senior researcher at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute.
But if on Mars conditions are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To address the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, we conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - the removal in orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-drosophiles.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how the embryo develops under weightless conditions.
We get at the exit an absolutely normal chick.
And then the problem begins.
"The problem is that this chick needs to find resistance, he needs to get up on his feet and start moving," explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Unable to find any support, the chicks were clumsy.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we hatched the chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," - says the failure of the experiment with chicks in space Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last time a biological mini-fish flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with the fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again - this is a single experiment, and such research should be carried out," - says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But approaching the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in the streak.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Hawk flew away, and no one on Earth could say if it would survive after flying into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight?
"After all, no one has answered this question," said Veteran of the rocket and space industry Wachtang Wachandze.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman astronaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child’s father, Andriyan Nikolaev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman astronaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice visited in orbit and even worked in open space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, there are a number of astronauts, who after long flights have spent everything, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, then it is dangerous even with orbital flights", - summarizes the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to find some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydro Laboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, in conditions of zero floatability, astronauts are learning how to work in open space.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for infants - a native element.
The small Ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land has emerged from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the baby is about 9 months with the mother in the digging fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, it is only 2 weeks.
"It's too little to forget," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for a born child weightlessness is a more natural state, then for a woman - gravity, the force of gravity is necessary.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, the ability to expel the fetus falls.
All right, let's drop that, relying on birth stimulants.
You can, of course, go to a special room for childbirth, she will push him out.
"And then what?" - asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earthly attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is not possible, as an adult, to wear a special loading suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will vitally need.
"And this experiment, which you and I will go to, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled person, a completely disadapted person," - predicts the head of the bioethics committee of IMBP RAN Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, later on, it will be a reality when the Earthlings on their ships go to a distant planet that will become home to their offspring born in space.
Chief of the Main Control and Audit Department: The verification of the weld system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good supervisory authorities and, despite the existence of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control and Audit Office, from an interview for the site Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack," Kala said.
Such findings are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German supervisory authorities.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Nechas’ approach to the so-called schwartz system is given.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits anything, then the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the institutions charged with checking and pursuing obligations,” Kala said.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was he talking about?
I mean a parallel check that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, the fact that European legislation stipulates how public procurement should be conducted follows national legislation and then also application in practice.
All the information was collected and, even in the case of an unfinished check, interesting differences were found - in simple terms, the legislation we have can be "accurate and errorless", but in the practice of application we are, in some respects, inferior to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more clarified rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is such joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the limit on orders.
Perhaps this system will be overflowing with “papers” so that those who wish to find gaps in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been reduced.
You are talking about the internal problems of the practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there such an organization as our CRU (Control and Audit Management) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof acts as our CRU, organized according to our principle, there is also a board that operates a little differently, but basically both institutions function similarly.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal states - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are monitored at the level of federal accounting chambers.
As far as local law is concerned, is it easier there than we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a sample, but it cannot be definitively said that it is better at everything.
Is it because they're better at control?
Definitely not, but I repeat, I don't like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, do they have consequences in some way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been demonstrated in our control work.
As we monitor the facts, some delays need to be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we have started to use our new tool "detection of the risk of non-economy", through which we have driven out almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest because the restrictions change, change the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think the passing of this law would benefit or add to the burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be “hardened” and they will be impossible to follow.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (for example, regional operational programmes - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will lead nowhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called welding system. What does it mean?
"Sweats-system" banned or allowed?
The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies charged with checking and pursuing obligations.
You can say, “We’ll change this law and solve it,” but you can’t say that we’re going to pretend that nothing is happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains quite strict rules as and what should be formally implemented, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
Mostly they pass, but somewhere with more caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region the roads were passable, but some were frozen and snowy.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but it should warm slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Rudny Mountains.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it became known that the places had a lower visibility due to the fog.
The R6 highway and first-class roads in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be rugged and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain tracks, are passable.
But on some of their sites there are still remnants of frozen and snow-capped places.
Particular attention should be paid to the roads located on the hills.
Pardubice and Kralovegrad region
The Czech Road and Highway Administration reports on its Internet pages that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are at risk of freezing, and there may be a layer of snow on mountain roads and highways.
Regional road workers warn drivers about ice, which can form especially on the elevations of the Pardubice region.
Glaciers can be around Lanshcrown, Ust-nad-Orliczy, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitavi or Visoke Mito, especially on second and third class roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads near Svitava are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and Orlicky Mountains.
A packed layer of snow is on the roads located on the elevations in the areas of Rikhnov-nad-Knezhnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic today variable clouds without precipitation.
Temperatures typically range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Plze<0xC5><0x88> Region
Roads in the Pilsen region this morning, but places need to be cautious and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is cold, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
In some places, drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 is now run almost without restrictions, however, road drivers recommend being cautious between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the south of Pilsen and Tahoe can get dirty plots.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and also in this case there is a warning in connection with the possibility of the appearance of slippery areas.
Drivers should be cautious, especially on low-traffic roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the heights of the Olomouc region should today take into account the snow drought on the road.
It remained after the application of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsky Krshizh.
At night, the snowfall forced road workers to go out, according to information from road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperk.
In other areas of the road, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"On the hills of Schumper lies the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Esenik should keep in mind the presence of snow in the Chervenogorsk saddle,” the Czech News Agency (CZA) said today.
At night, their colleagues from Esenik went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the elevations after chemical treatment remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are unrestricted, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in forest areas, where moisture is still retained.
Ustecki Krai, Liberec Krai
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are still some difficult places to pass.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, a mountain road has been closed on the site from Telnice to Klinice in the Ustecki region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the south-east of the Czech Middle Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of the <0xC5><0xA0>teti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - all day rain and snow melted, at night the sky cleared and frost began.
Unfavorable conditions are reported on the main highway and on the I/13 road on the border between the Ustecki and the Liberec region.
Due to the curved branches of trees under a layer of snow, pertaining to the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnice on Kninice.
Simon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy in concerts
What do you think the world is going to end in less than a month?
This is just one of the many alarming news that we humans are so easily caught up in.
Together with The Tap Tap, we are constantly joking about this topic and saying that we are the only group in the world that will be able to gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fundraising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20, at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will start in parallel.
They will end, roughly speaking, when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about what state of this world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time provide us with support.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed an anti-end-of-the-world hymn called "The End of the World Cancels".
Will the beloved YouTube listener’s anthem sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything works out and the end of the world does not come.
It will be sung by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
The words to this song written and played the role of Jesus in the clip Tomas Ganak, participates in the performance also Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of Czech cultural life as we hold many charitable events and concerts.
We are actively trying to connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What is the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
For the sixth year, we have been working with the Tap civil association at the Edlicki Institute for the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Edlichka Institute and carry out fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and so we try to provide them with this opportunity.
Within the framework of the project of additional construction of the Edlicka Institute, a separate building will emerge in the future, to which we will move with this project.
There will be several musical groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to create a program that is of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irgi Suhi will perform.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “great events” in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the festival "Prague Spring" and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would love to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
You have serious plans about the foreign country, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the road in terms of organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five riders on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a whole lot of cargo and tool boxes.
However, while coping with this without any problems. Czech airlines <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways airlines have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have you encountered to the present moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have witnessed that the East is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are a lot of barriers, and there is still a wildlife movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
There are also no such trivial things as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with advanced countries?
There are a lot of things whose performance level is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people who are concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in the streets, to go to the toilet, to the museum, to wherever they want to go.
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier-freeness is one thing, but by the time famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then everything will really begin to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap is very popular nowadays, but let’s go back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Edlicka Institute as an educator, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself and play on the saxophone, together with my colleague I organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, over time, as our host Ladia Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Is it that the popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It’s true, it helped us that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the band’s propaganda.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can evaluate is essentially non-existent.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the intention of making The Tap Tap so good?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is pity, it is natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned personalities that we should pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I’m saying that if people with disabilities do something, it’s a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Has success ensured that you are a strict leader, as many people think you are?
If we want to do the work qualitatively, we must be uncompromising in many things and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think that's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they quickly lose enthusiasm.
But that’s what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
There are currently twenty members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, this is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a telebridge at the time of the performance of the band's song The Tap Tap "The End of the World is Cancelled".
The aim of this project is to raise funds of SEK 25 million for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Edlichka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 SEK, for children under 12 years admission is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and took an active part in a number of ESA projects in the following years.
But Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in spaceflights, but this was not always met with understanding.
I would like to recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933, presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to Space".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltri and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his "Introduction to Space".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned propagandist of space science, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the back of the Moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built a railway train, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket had to be used for acceleration or to brake the truck.
Information about this dressage is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The study was carried out by the Arms Engineering Section in cooperation with professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzhitsky.
From the preserved materials, it can be seen that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, work was interrupted.
In 1937, in the specialized press, the idea of a photoelectric rocket-fighter, which was proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, appeared, and the following year, the work "Air rocket-torpedo and aviation rocket-bomb" by the author Levya-Kzhivoblotsky was published.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war itself, all the projects of military use of missile equipment were handled by the Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation the work was completed due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work, devoted to space science, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronauticze).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine "Problems", which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovic proposed to organize a society that will be engaged in space.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) has tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn POA became a valid member.
The following year, Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902-1959) became the first president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Raketa Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, tests of a two-stage RM-2 rocket were conducted at the Bled Desert.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to observe the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1S - 0.62 l.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Thereafter, versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Studies) in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmologist after Vladimir Remec.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The decision sparked a lively debate in society.
It will undoubtedly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of labour-power (wages), a price tension arises.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the state in which the producer, by means of the delivery of a cheap commodity, tries to resist economic competition by "defeating" the value of the competitor in order to take over the greater part of the market and thereby increase his own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either transferring production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearing. As a result, unemployment increases in those countries where the cost of labor, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable expenditures of the state on social needs are increasing.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social economic and social damage they inflict in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
The unceremonious methods of private capital create at the level of individual states’ economies a situation where governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own population to private capital at will, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes to the current legislation.
The aim is to economically force its people to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to reduce the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, the poverty rate increases and, at the same time, the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for several years, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases where the employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra for them to get a living minimum.
Such a scandal has become known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on a low-income wage in the backyard.
The question is, where will he come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as a Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media up to the nausea claim that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists that the state should not intervene in the economy through its governing actions.
Next, the question should be answered, is private capital, now practically managing politics and thus the entire state, not acting for its own selfish purposes?
The unambiguous answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobbying in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, in ensuring mutual benefits, in legislation, where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that, due to a lack of funds, state ministries commission the development of bills to private law firms that are closely associated with the industry.
The bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the Western type states, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly finding itself in a situation as described by Appian in the "Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state has long been disintegrating and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, unlawful receiving of mercy by means of stones and swords.
The corruption and bribery flourished without any prohibitions, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote"...decent people at all did not run for the position of ruler, at the end of the day the state was left without a consul for eight months. .. ..
As in antiquity, in modern society, their own reckless interests prevail without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer intended to be used for public purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: an unprecedented decline of the elite without any attempt to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the cause of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes we must seek in the reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite is completely ignoring the consequences for the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity as we know it from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore of a systemic nature.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and it can never come out" - Sting, the song "Fragile", where the main verse of the refrain is the words: "do not forget how fragile we are".
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Huttel Schnapper, wife of Meer Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has provoked a host of responses.
Some argue for Israel, arguing its position that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are acting as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing this with the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel writes at the time.
I do not want to think about who is a criminal in these periodic murder waves, and who is a victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation and were not witnesses to the onset of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is primarily served by the 95-year-old tension (from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people always took their own steps, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to predetermined goals.
It must be assumed that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, there is one that could be considered as the head of a sparrow (I do not know if anyone stands above them, but this is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Sure, sure.
They bought the first news agency in the nineties of the 19th century to stop the rumors linking their name to the criminal acts in the higher realms under whose shadow they were, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of their wealth, or both.
They have large stocks in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are leading or preparing war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four countries).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank under the Rothschild Bank of America, during the civil war he began to issue his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve System), he was killed in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by the great 33rd level mason Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was to destroy the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world population of about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be enough to provide their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources).
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, works is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer of solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the Fed’s reasoning, which should have prevented a repeat of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash World War I through the assassination of the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended with a sudden, militaryly and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the fragmentation of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, occurred.
In order to facilitate the unleashing of the Second World War, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, rather than creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it was only left to force the Germans to create a strong enough, accusing the guilty and offering simple solutions to the leader.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of a Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created a precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began to take place.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The outbreak of World War II, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish world state by the community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the state of Israel was proclaimed to create the center of the Third War.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will be a victim of fighting on the frontlines, now together with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment generates resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are pushing people to vote exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu's hawk is a typical example of the 2 percent of the world's fascist, loyal international bankers, a politician who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to overgrow the world.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a common crisis, and people will adopt a new world order.”
The new world order in their representation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born at birth is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes a being under total control.
“And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one who is not marked with the name of the beast or with the number of his name may buy or sell.
This is wisdom: everyone who has understanding can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of a man, and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.
"Operation Argo: When There's Nowhere Worse, Call Hollywood"
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist protesting students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who were the patrons of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration was not expecting a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the chess overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of the allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate evoked at home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After difficult journeys, they finished their journey at the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover-up legend, according to which they traveled on Canadian passports as members of a film crew, looking for a place in the country to shoot a science fiction epic.
A combination of genres
The plan, invented by evacuation expert Tony Mendes, demanded Hollywood cooperation.
To make the legend credible, specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, held press conferences, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-kinoopus", the story of a successful case, a hoax - an example can be a series of movies about friends of Oushen.
The film constantly changes the mood - on the one hand, documentary scenes from Tehran (the headlines show iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, light Hollywood excerpts interspersed with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the staircases of institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck had a great career reboot.
From a ridiculous actor became a respected director, and his play ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third feature film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, baby, goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleck film not to be shot in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feel of the atmosphere of the place refers to the qualities that elevated the director’s earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it at Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets when real events are reconstructed – the opening scenes of the embassy’s fall impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history suddenly changes.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues achieve in the scenes of fiction (a fake headquarters on a Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes he thinks of something - there it all comes out not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at Tehran airport, and chasing on the runway look pretty lame).
The drawback of Argo is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film lacks a bit of drama, it’s a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciating the production and retro-style, recreating the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to catch up.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still in a certain sense, living story, as well as to testify how exaggerated are the notions of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd order or project from an EU workshop”.
“We were prompted by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the administration of major European companies,” said Patrick Nager, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities already put forward for nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rates of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop people can put up for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote itself will be held until the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU regulations in dispute include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which as a result is harmful to nature, as well as the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury graders only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of the food cells for chickens.
Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "butterfly oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic is now even defending the demands of its banks under threat of veto).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, the top-quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and should not have shown "anomalous curvature".
At the same time, the Commission justified itself by only harmonising the existing fragmented national rules that have made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some countries, has still softened standards for fruit and vegetables, citing that existing directives will lead to food waste.
Last year’s EU regulation that sold balloons must be provided with a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them without the supervision of adults may be the candidate for the win in the poll.
The EU has turned to U.S. studies that say balloons in play are a potential cause of death of children by suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from blowing in fair chickpeas.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is also quite absurd: anyone who holds any official position in the EU cannot, given the delicacy of the subject for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but should instead say "BYURM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "Laissez Faire", proposed for the vote, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting grants for grant applications.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are at a disadvantage because we don’t have a sea.
Let’s ask the European Union for compensation,” said the then Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palas (CSDP) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain yield, and as a result of the so-called intervention procurement, the state had full stockpiles that needed to be removed.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for obtaining subsidies were offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemts (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to go to the preparation of an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Strange orders are an exception
While the regulations in the Member States are easily criticised, the EU's efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union are, in the opinion of many experts, more commendable.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the use of EU subsidies for projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with deepening European integration, but which Member States achieved in the discussion of the budget.
Emotions among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians retained the name "Olomoutsky Cheese", however "Tuzem rum", whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename it "Tuzemak".
Rum can only be called products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "gorgonzola", marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, have already been found, for example, Karlovar cookies, Pogorjelitsky and Tr<0xC5><0xA1>ebo<0xC5><0x84>ski carp and Zhatecky cheese.
Also, the EU trademark can be proud of Pardubice spice and gorjitski tubes.
“People want me to protect the Republic, but I am a fan,” Okamura said.
Senator, how does it come to a person's mind to run for president?
I’m not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I would not have run anywhere.
But I can’t watch the country go bust over the last 20 years, thieves gossiping, people raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I’m forty years old and I’m an independent person who doesn’t belong to any party, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who have chosen you?
I have always said that I would join the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool by which I can implement my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the broadest authority.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation, whisper at our bar or at the TV, but we are ready to piss anyone who tries to change something.
Added to this are the media, which denigrate people and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was bribing journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jerzy Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle began with the thesis on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and on reverse property declarations in the amount of more than twenty million.
To do this, the law needs to be changed.
As president, you have no such authority, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for tours to become a free enterprise, this was promoted.
The problem is politics – when someone comes up with a good offer on the left or right, they are deliberately obstructed, and that deters citizens.
As an independent, non-party person, I have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it without party shelves, without regard for dogmas.
Do you consider yourself more to the right or to the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think people treat me more like a leftist.
It doesn’t matter to me – a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It’s not that someone is on the right, it’s that someone is on the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it is proposed by the CCP or the GDP, and I will likewise be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you’re a populist.
But don't you prove that by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
You might call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or they’re being talked about by prominent experts.
Without the support of the parliament, you will have only slogans.
In politics, you won’t last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize the criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other choice.
Just to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the heads of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And in case of refusal, they will have to tell you why they do not want it.
If there is a strong personality who will voice abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of public pressure.
I’m an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and opinions.
I am only a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I’m trying to do things on my own; if that doesn’t work, I’ll be done and back in the private sector in six years.
It sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know I’m not going to do anything alone, so I bypassed a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.
I went to Radmi Yanchura, he refused because of the large amount of work.
Also, I at least supported the leading investigative journalist Jan Lorentzov, who uncovered the scam with light fuel oil products.
I’ve nominated because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I’m on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people chose the Senate so that the changes would be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the cleanliness of every potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money for it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.
You don't have any money?
You’re talking about property declarations, but how are your own dealings with it?
Personal property is estimated at about 60 million.
I have a plot of land in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of artwork for about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, well, a few more million on the bill.
By the way, Aston Martin came to me because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against ruse and lawlessness.
You drive to Aston Martin, own a $60 million estate, and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I have invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors indicates that my program isn’t so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for an election campaign out of my pocket.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover me the Senator's salary.
But I wouldn’t live on that money, for example, I wouldn’t be able to pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for office.
So you're going to go into entrepreneurship so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut this activity?
It does not depend on the amount of salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activity.
For example, the managing director of a travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like me to be a moneyless man who would protect the Republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you, as an entrepreneur, get used to monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get on and on.
If I were president, I would have finished my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday issue of the newspaper "Pravo".
The architects of MVRDV prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Speykenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, we can finally see something interesting again,” says Lizette Verhaig, who walks along the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, says, “No, this building is really beautiful.”
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one wants to go to such old-fashioned libraries anymore, right?
Speykenisse, a small sleeper town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted concrete miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city’s fathers realized that they had only one chance to beat the statistics: to build a library here!
Vini Maas of Rotterdam’s architectural bureau MVRDV, a master of bold column diagrams and author of clever, sometimes even cynical, constructions, addressed the task with his usual unhingedness and appeared at a 2003 competition audition with five books under his arm and ear.
And while the jury members looked back and squeezed their shoulders, the daring Maas made a pyramid of his original gift of size and concluded his speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here's my suggestion: "The Book Mountain" in Speykenis, the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses totaling 50 apartments.
In early November, "Book Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the competition "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Wooden Structures Competition.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which before it could offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly unsightly town hall, whose white facades suggest a dairy factory, has become richer in one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly - in Speykenis appeared the first in the history of this city a public building of cultural purpose.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: the Eldorado book under the hood for cheese.
There is only one elevator passing in the center of the mountain range, because true lovers of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The glazed room on all sides is bright and easily visible, the floors made of burnt brick and elegant street lamps unmistakably create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly restored.
The eye involuntarily looks for benches, dogs and football players boys and girls.
Everywhere, books, books, books.
“Usually book shelves stand along the facades, and in the middle is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless,” says Vini Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space from the feet to the head and pulled out the reading area from the inside out.
The interior space of the book mountain is skillfully used: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical premises.
Particularly pleased are the black bookshelves, which serve as a decoration of the walls, railings and stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even tempted architects and engineers are lost in guesses, what is this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with secondary materials,” explains Jop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Speykenisse community, in line with the requirements of the standard.
And at one agribusiness in Friesland, we found a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fiber material of millimeter thickness has been used as a lining under the roots.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textile serves one or two seasons, after which it can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed into a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastik (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a little like a new car and a little sneakers.
105 steps lead to the top.
Anyone who crosses the nearly 500-metre-long path will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and wooden figs in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first and foremost about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
The Cost of a New Soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
For its heating and cooling, the heat of the earth is used.
Although Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days, the sun only enters for a short time.
Wide farms made of glued wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lizette Verhaig has been here as well.
Cynthia Bogard, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, called Buchenberg “the soul of the Speykenisse that has long been lacking.”
The reason: a few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to occupy empty seats on the shelves of a library not yet fully equipped - at the time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are upstairs.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Vinnie Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident is in some way connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem, which in professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Speykenisse wrote his literary history.
They are very young and unskilled.
This is just the starting point for building an identity.
Sabo: "Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinians’ application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
What's that?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely moving from a policy that, so to speak, was run by the United States, to actually German foreign policy.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent single policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are only sensing their role so far, but they are on their way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
Such foreign policy as is carried out by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position in their national interests, independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are very different from those of other major states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf states.
It must therefore be cautious not to offend the public and elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn’t attach too much importance to this, it’s not a completely one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Did Germany harm its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don’t think that it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are differing views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S., on the other hand, has vetoed it.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of U.S. domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as it always seems.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a single, non-contradictory European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they cannot act within a broader approach and are forced to act instead based solely on their own vision of the situation.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
This topic has always been skeptical.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take on the leading role?
Or is it still hard to give Germany a leading role?
Germany is not accustomed to this yet, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis – every time Germany takes on an important role, there are various anti-German sentiments.
The Germans can’t just deal with it.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to take into account a variety of neighbors and opinions, which is not easy.
So, the U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if you do not like it, unpleasant or increases the dislike for you - such is life!

Trademark Protection in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
It is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a company that specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
There's a new case of this kind on my desk every week.
It is enough for imitators to add only a few letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci comes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered there the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also uses the name of the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringement of intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, this is not the case for Pattloch. At the request of his trustees, he opposes that Chinese enterprises should be officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere by the Trademark Registration Office.
The Chinese call it "Ban Minpai", a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban daquan".
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not acknowledge their guilt.
“It’s damaging to business, it needs to be combated,” Pattloch said.
“The brand blurs, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much.”
Financial losses and procedural costs in affected industries are estimated in millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China with sales of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to achieve the removal of dubious entries in the register of trademarks, and it is costly.
The process can take up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed the claims, since after a long time the contested name became a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem, similar to the star Mercedes.
The Volvo company Geely originally used a blue-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile was looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The Trademark Office of the CTMO in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the lack of staff and equipment.
But last year there was a “return from an emergency in the work process to the norm.”
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases on objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending production at the department.
Fighting this is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has led the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, according to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth many times more to protest, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans succeeded in eliminating the illegal production of counterfeit car parts.
However, the simulator has secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was an omission of its own, as surnames in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the Trademark Registration Office of the CTMO rejected the Munich claims.
True, in both subsequent instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues the fight so far.
You need to be vigilant
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the vessels.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Domestic costs are hardly accountable, the firm’s archives had to be reviewed even 100-year-old documents in order to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a “large six-digit euro amount” for settlement.
“It’s clear from this how expensive it is for us,” says Ventzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
That is, if the imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The company has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this was able to prevent registration.
“We need to be vigilant,” says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch’s lawyer recommend that German companies be very cautious with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark protection regulations, rather foreigners should “all that is worth protecting in any way, register also in China,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the final act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party licensing fees for his own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Sing, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbonga choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are rejoicing.
A history of relationships that have crossed a distance of more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, flooding is given: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, women's boats and men's shoes pick up the pace on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
It is only after this that the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise - they come forward, enchant and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his maternity shoes when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbonga choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty choir members aged 23 to 69 came to the rehearsal, from a specialist in human genetics to a choirmaster.
"Om"Obani" is a difficult thing, each choir voice has its own text, besides in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
According to UNAIDS, the United Nations’ AIDS programme, there are about 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Essex, Voices for Africa found leaders in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take over the boss.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in the Zulu language means narrator or admirer.
In this room, they don’t speak fluently on the band, but they can sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been teaching songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even bringing them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Essigeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, among the inhabitants many children.
More than 300 of them were left without their parents, who died of the HIV virus.
In Essizheni, the miniature reflects the disease of all Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, the Imbogna participants saw a lot of children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but just everything: food, clothes, education.
Without education, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private obligation of the individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since been almost professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Essington.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Pubic pediculosis and dandruff belong to parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low – however, about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among young people than among other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also often have human papillomavirus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about one-tenth less than last year.
What symptoms indicate venereal disease?
With infectious diseases, ulcers in the genital area, complaints of urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as blisters or seals can occur.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent changes in sexual partners.
With an early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most IPPs and avoid distant consequences.
The sheriff’s office, donations and, last but not least, the fees for choir performances all over Germany allow you to collect something.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Essizheni," says Annette Lennartz, the association's president.
In the village itself, Zodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman, is at the disposal of money from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well organized, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as old women are called in Zulu language, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, given them a roof over their heads, and made sure that children in uniform appeared in class on time every day.
Those who have no relatives are taken into the shelter by Hannisil, a single woman who receives a salary from the union, as well as two cooks who prepare for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the U.S. health organization PSI, organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefers to be deeply silent.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s related to sexuality.”
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent years.
But it also lies on the wandering workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they’re hardly used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support a little cultural exchange, Ibmogni’s choir makes a trip to South Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in black - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads also to Essizheni, where the singers visit the undercover children.
Despite the fact that a small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the Etsulveni River it is more than famous.
"Go to Essex, there's light," the people here say.
And after the 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the dip singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here too.
NASA Opens Ice on Mercury <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover can be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the permanently shadowed region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Water is believed to come from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, the scientific director of the probe.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other places in the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows into infinity given.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun after Neptune, Ceres, according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union, is not a “planet.”
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, more difficult to identify in the stellar circle pink "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation — scientists unromantally call it W5 — was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This overflowing heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
A doughnut-like ring consists of the material that the star threw out in the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are emerging from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope has taken this photo of the galactic birthing room.
The star cluster of the Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, the colors are better.

It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity with the Earth's continent has brought to this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography ensures expressive color transmission.
This new star in all its beauty was able to be photographed only with the help of the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came into being is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps it is the fragments of the moon Saturn, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: the Waterstorm Galaxy
Depending on the color transmission, images of spiral galaxies are transformed into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory, the image shows a several thousand light-years distant Trifid nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-fold, three-part), as dark strips of dust divide the warmed heart of the cradle of stars into three parts.
In the constellation of Serpentine, astronomers have photographed a forerunner of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies face each other and inevitably collide.
This birth star Hubble telescope shot in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn’t like technical shortcuts can call it the “Southern Pipe Wheel.”
A photograph taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, which is 1400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the size of ordinary home dust.
This image was made from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 was photographed by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
A large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The stellar cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, coupled with the Rosetta Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars — 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe had mostly hydrogen.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersge, even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more – and the spaces available to them to look deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the "Big Binocular Telescope" has been installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of a single mirror is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Great South African Telescope in South Africa has been segmented for cost-saving purposes.
Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly attached at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light picking capacity.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for the Extraterrestrial Mind (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the "Very Large Telescope" - completely corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow to illuminate even the middle infrared spectrum in the visual tube.
The European Very Large Telescope is also planned to be installed at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror should be spread over 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Kek telescopes at Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Kek telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, also looks into the sky with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters - will appear on Mauna Kea.
Here you can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been providing paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system - primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope’s tasks is to search for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists have suggested that there is ice at the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger rotates closer to the planet's north pole.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - scientists are now confident of this.
Drink oil every day and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically honorable age.
There is also a museum of longevity.
The search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically honorable age.
There is also a museum of longevity.
The search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
A trip through the Talish Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A minibus with thunder rolls along a winding road past densely forested hills, stormy creeks and simple peasant houses.
Everything around you is so green and bright that you might think you’re in the Black Forest.
But it is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the talismans - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak Farsi and Azerbaijani perfectly and are distinguished by longevity.
The final point is Larry.
The small town is dotted with too heavy-handed architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tedious.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not yet reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is something in Lerik to interest tourists.
"In May, Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have a festival of the world's oldest people," Fatulaeva says.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented biography of about eight dozen talis from these places, which are more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to the black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is Chaban Shirali Muslimov, who is allegedly 168 years old.
Birth certificates, however, are not.
And given that the eldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, is 122 years old, the age of the Muslim seems extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did the Muslims add a couple of dozen years to their age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard about long-term residents in Central Asia.
"A staggering number of people of advanced age can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholtz, "there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is not possible, as there were no civil status registers.
A glass of melted oil every day
However, there is a fact that people in the area of Lerik are strikingly often reaching biblical age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years old living here.
Why are there so many long-lived people here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with special genes of talis.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
Tallis love meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it a primitive way of life that preserves people’s youth? In Chengemira, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzoeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil that she tirelessly rides back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughters, who have long since had their grandchildren.
There will also be two children in the vicinity.
In the kitchen, guests prepare tea, which is served in typical crawling glasses of armoud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under the headscarf she hides long dark-brown hairs, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always have my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I've never used shampoo," Mirzaeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live.
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I’ve never bought food in my entire life.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest thing was after World War II.
But it became better when the "favorite father" Heydar Aliyev stood at the wheel.
Propaganda does not often sound in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan practically knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, after which his son Ilham took over the reins of government.
However, there is no poverty among the elderly of Azerbaijan.
230 manats (approximately the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions this is the amount for which you can live well.
And perhaps the long-grown son of Mirzaeva is also right: "Old people in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
There is no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is not in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Competitive demonstrations in Cairo indicate a deep division of the country.
A future constitution based on Shariah has met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not buy the pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Mursi, almost apologising, said he had temporarily curtailed the constitutional court’s jurisdiction and expanded its jurisdiction “to save the revolution.”
However, what the 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the American University of Southern California really wants to save is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged into the 15-hour night race with obstacles at an Islamist-minded constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the courts are based on “principles of Islamic law”.
But what do “principles” mean?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use the blurred wording and the resulting legal luft to interpret the sharia more strictly.
At least one new article suggests this: in all matters pertaining to Sharia law, al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamist institution with great authority throughout Sunni Islam, should be brought before the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy is overseeing the legislation, which would de facto result in a restriction of the judiciary.
There is much to be interpreted in the draft constitution.
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to the military court should be maintained.
These courts during Mubarak's reign served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morality and values".
Legally, this is formulated so vaguely that government institutions will be able to control even the content of films and literature with the help of this article.
In open text, this means nothing more than censorship.
No article at all establishes direct equality between men and women.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his messengers.
But what the offense is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that "insulting people" is prohibited is also questionable.
Will there be enough cartoons about the president or jokes about the jurist?
The question of interpretation, as much in this project, which Mursi proposes to sign and which, he said, “very soon” will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
For several weeks, opposition to the supremacy of Islamists has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution was “in the dumpster of history.”
Through a short news service on Twitter, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to lead a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and take him down," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet vindicated,” the Egyptian opposition politician Khaled Ali said.
Many judges also said they did not want to watch the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for an opposing demonstration, but, out of caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and followers of the Salafis who shouted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
They demanded from Mursi: "Clean the country!" and assured: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square where it all began provoked a state of virtual civil war.
Mursi’s followers obviously didn’t want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loudly and clearly.
Now it is time to let the people decide at the electoral urn in which direction the country should go.
The majority of Islamists support the project, which is considered a decided case.
"The concept of 'human rights' is not mentioned at all"
Hafiz Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court with Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursi’s influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the president de facto cancelled it,” Saeda said.
Without civil society, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a repayment for that.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster that you cannot control."
Norwegian codfish: the worst-smelling fish in the world?
Norway’s five million population has one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also around the world.
Perhaps the secret of the success of this country is somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely malicious fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a sparkling smell of rakfisk - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, three hours’ drive from Oslo.
Around the snow-capped picturesque views. It is very beautiful, but the inextinguishable characteristic odor spreads in the air.
Raccoon is a trout sprinkled with salt and wandered in the water for up to a year, depending on what kind of sting you need to achieve.
As twilight thickens and cools, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this very, so to speak, exciting dish.
"It is eaten raw and drunk with a slice of aquavit, local mint vodka," explains Harvard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and co-chairman of the "Raffisk general", who leads the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat fish cut into small cubes and drink it with large amounts of alcohol.
“Somebody likes aquavit more than raccoon,” says Harvard.
This drink is capable of breaking the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - it is little different from the portion of land that you took with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when, even before the emergence of refrigerators, fish were soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water in the fall.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly digested, it was extracted and, by silencing the perception with alcohol, consumed in food.
In memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the United States.
Nowadays, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who are attracted here by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a long-time rival, and not so long ago and a much more affluent neighbor) come here massively to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat sinister, element of Norway’s past.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world’s news, and most of the country’s residents seem to agree.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called “the July 22 attack.”
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
At the heart of Norway’s current prosperity is the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“However, oil isn’t the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, who wears trays with long-lasting raffia, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, wise.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English very well.
We don't like to show up, we don't brag.
Norway is very careful with its oil – most of the revenue of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was messing around with money they didn’t have, Norway sparingly calculated all the costs.
“While you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there's a raccoon," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in a queue for some food - I'll have enough raffia.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat - it's definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special dinner dedicated to raffisk, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a live TV show, which shows the lead in a butterfly tie, surrounded by plates with raffia.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what grade did you give for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Harvard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling from a chair, maybe over the aquavit.
Or maybe just breathing in the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto will face a difficult start to his career.
As Mexico’s newly elected president Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to take a look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country’s population.
Traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly bad state.
This city is overloaded with transport and at the best of times, and since Monday, steel fences have been erected, intersecting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear the presidential bandage and take the reins of the country.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, who is now in power, but the country has sunk in a war on drugs that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government is declaring to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence,” Peña Nieto told US President Barack Obama earlier this week in the White House’s oval office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, alongside the US President, Mr. Peña Nieto’s political career developed as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the country’s capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Straight-line man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
The inhabitants put in his credit the revival of tourism, the development of the resort sphere and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are markedly different from the roads with protrusions and pits that used to be in this place.
The signs with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We have hopes for real and serious change with him,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from the Peña Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive changes, which are so urgently needed by our country, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was displaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence at the presidential palace in Los Pinos, the party places great hopes on Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he denies the accusations of incontinence put forward by the opposition to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very committed to embodying his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent politician and, above all, a person who is able to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden beneath the intersections of highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality also bear the harsh nature of this metropolis.
Troops were recruited earlier this year to appease drug trafficking gangs in those areas, and violence against women is particularly acute here.
Dozens of bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near an extensive landfill in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the government of Mr. Peña Nieto, far exceeding that in the infamous city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become nicknamed when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, at best, it can be said that during his tenure as Governor, he was unable to cope with the problem of killing women.
In the worst case scenario, his administration is accused of completely ignoring this problem.
A resident of a concrete house similar to most of the houses in this outdated area, Irina Buendía has a hard time holding back her tears by showing me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her cohabitant killed her.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed away before that," Buendía recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and her body was already stranded.
Mariana’s mother recounts this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifix, on which only one word is drawn: justice.
This, they said, was denied to the family.
“State officials treated me like an old gossip, dissatisfied with the disturbance.
They want people to just believe everything they say and keep quiet.
But that’s not right, that’s not possible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around,” she says.
Having worn the presidential bandage on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence-related crimes, and the new president has pledged to make a solution to this problem a priority during his reign.
“I hope that he will be exactly the same president as he was the governor,” said Olvera, a congressman from the Valle de Bravo PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning has not complained of mistreatment, the prosecution said.
Prosecutors are trying to disprove Bradley Manning’s claims of poor detention conditions.
The hearing focused on Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning’s conditions of detention were cruel.
The U.S. military has been accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that plaintiff Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified materials in U.S. history, did not take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had to transfer while in military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, Military Prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that records of Manning's weekly visits by the prison administration for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia.
A cross-examination of Manning ' s application to terminate the case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves a sufficient punishment was conducted the day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Fein and Manning reviewed reports that were completed after Manning’s visits by administration officials during his time in Quantico Prison, where he was in a strict detention regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about the reports, Manning admitted that he assessed the prison administration's treatment of him as "excellent" and the general terms of detention as "very professionally organized".
The reports under review do not contain any complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being explicitly asked about the terms of his detention, says Fein.
Manning replied that he had expressed his oral concern about the problems and that the representatives of his administration who had visited had discussed the problems with him and had stated that they would deal with them, but had not recorded it in writing.
“They recorded ‘problems are absent’ (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn’t mean I didn’t raise the issue in the conversation,” Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Linde, also asked Manning why he hadn’t complained about being mistreated in January 2011 during a committee meeting that considered the suicide intentions he had expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning responded that during the meeting he wanted to have the “prevention of injury” regime removed from him and to mitigate the conditions of detention.
Military officials explained that a limited regime of detention - to a level lower than the regime of surveillance to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay with them canceling the injury prevention regime ... so that my life level improves, from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday of his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait, and that one day he had lost consciousness because of the intense heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult when you are not told how your destiny is decided and what is happening in the outside world.
“My world has shrunk to Camp Arifjan, to the size of my prison,” Manning said on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in this cage."
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day — in complete solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, slippers, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move, as sleeping or even just lying down during the day was prohibited by the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, the light in his eyes was constantly penetrating the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned in bed at night, he said, he was awakened and forced to turn his back.
Manning's lawyer filed an official objection to Manning's mistreatment in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
In addition, a judge on Friday asked Manning about a statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning said he was unable to cover the blanket during the inspection.
Responding to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's orders that he should throw a blanket that he could cover, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to throw it.
Manning said on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could use a rubber pantyhose or slippers to injure himself, but did not.
That night, Manning testified, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from the cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to endure during his imprisonment and significantly shorten the term of imprisonment if Manning is found guilty by the military court, which should begin his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and challenge other charges as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims Manning was detained in Quantico under rules governing the contents of detainees with the strictest regime.
The charges brought against Manning include co-opting the enemy, illegally facilitating the disclosure of data on the Internet, transferring information related to national defense, and hijacking of state property or documents.
If convicted of all charges, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind people of the country’s difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American descent are splitting between the two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked through the arrival corridor, approached the border control zone and froze on the spot.
The signs indicated two rows: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and have been called a Mexican all my life.
It’s just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and my friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later I stopped at the complex design of "American of Mexican descent".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather’s homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
That’s why I got my American passport and became a queue for the Extranjeros.
I recalled this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto has eagerly spoken about the rise of the Mexican economy, which will allow Mexicans now, with the same success, to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto has promised to continue the war on drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals have been made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a heavy, old-fashioned issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and, under the rifles, forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only worth to any U.S. official to silence at least a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society immediately there are complaints that the Americans are invading the sovereignty of neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with belligerence.
At the same time, Mexico’s relationship with more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States is the most difficult.
Want to talk about insults?
Enough of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country for themselves, and those for whom there is no such opportunity.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican descent for just one reason: at some point in their family history, no one – father or grandfather – was able to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to Mexico.
Most often, they were Mexicans of a certain type - slumped, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and got a good job, but let's not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider our own.
The United States of America.
In addition, we know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and ruling class do not like us.
We respond to them the same way.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as unreal Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We wouldn’t be behind the silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual bonds.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Americans understand the pro-Mexican identities.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican descent do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We are Americans in Mexico.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship was already not sufficiently confusing, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to rebuild relations with the diaspora.
They want Americans of Mexican descent to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit, and we could persuade political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too many insults in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the spread of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not find this country so beautiful.
Excuse me, but take care of it yourself, Amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent are still offended by how they dealt with their relatives recently in Mexico.
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
The Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is there a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
The usual, meaningless controversy over who started first; many buildings have been turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis, have been killed; for the first time in the conflict, the rockets fired from the territory of the Gaza Strip have been fired.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians have been hopelessly caught up in their eternal conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the "Arab Spring" have engulfed many established realities in a rebellious storm, and the Palestinians with the Israelis have not managed to stay away from the whirlwind that has shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give reason for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, will be implemented, the clashes that took place this week have only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in Gaza in 2007, will say they have forced Israel to retreat despite the losses it has suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group’s leaders have been wiped out and 1.7 million people blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to wipe out Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time works for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and rich friends.
The emerging regional leader Turkey, once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing Gulf states.
Hamas supporters proclaim the creation of an Islamic crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the paramilitary group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which more and more pro-Islam rebels are about to overthrow the power of Bashar Assad.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where under President Mohammed Mursi the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid little attention to Hamas’ support.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "hard" line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli anti-missile system Iron Dome justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas missiles launched.
The citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully, at least for some time.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the US has remained true to its unchanged stance; many European countries have also blamed the start of the last round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004 about 30 Israelis have been killed by missiles fired from the territory of the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide terrorists, partly due to the wall that enters the territory of the West Bank.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - as part of the preparations for the January 22 elections - has joined with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of giving the Palestinians their own state?
If we give them all the power in the West Bank, won’t they start launching rockets from there toward Israel, as do their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to hold them behind the wall and firmly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Supporters of the "hard" line may win; however, their calculations may be refuted by the Arab Spring.
Although the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defensive part of Israel’s budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Unleashing a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egypt’s President Mursi, who worked with Barack Obama on the ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel, to a lesser extent, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in Arab countries, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a slow-acting bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, similar to the bus blasted in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement are being paid by the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an external impetus.
There remains the only solution that has been relentlessly called for by sane representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two states and Israel’s surrender of territories in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the sides of the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long since decided to block arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, have a more advantageous position than ever to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming vote at the UN, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
Its role in putting Israel at the negotiating table should also be played by President Obama.
During his first term, he never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
After returning to the White House, he continues to show his reluctance to join in solving the problem.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on unified packaging for cigarettes has entered into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and images of disease-affected parts of the body are contrasted on depressing green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products has entered into force, replacing the logos and color scheme of different brands with the same box of depressed-olive color with horrific pictures of their sickness of smoking parts of the body and images.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packets introduced in mandatory order from this Saturday - the names of the stamps, which are printed with the same small font.
These are the world’s toughest conditions for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the purpose of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this harmful habit of fashion status.
Research shows that people who have not started smoking before the age of 26 in 99 out of 100 cases never become smokers.
“It’s obvious that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey by designing packaging,” explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing research that shows that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a child’s fingerprint.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest smoking rate in the world, so these changes will not have a significant impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market on which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will lead to serious consequences other than those conceived by its initiators,” said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of small family-owned company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for cigarette butts and silicone cases hiding unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (almost from zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Tobacco, and British Imperial Tobacco were brought to trial.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 products to wholesale companies and is waiting for a new batch.
This is a good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks among the segment of the population targeted by these measures.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from posting ads online, but it cannot restrict foreign sites from doing so.
“If you trade in tobacco products and you only have this small loophole left, the idea of promoting your product online will seem extremely tempting to you,” explains Becky Freeman, a researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews on brands written by supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is it really a matter of the hands of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he did not spare the effort and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry have even gone to such measures as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states are making claims within the World Trade Organization, stating that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations with all these countries.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to impose the mandatory posting of photos warning of the dangers of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstratively disobedient to innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
“You just grab a cigarette and hide the package in your pocket,” explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on the package.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, the head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in downtown Sydney, claims that the same packaging has made it difficult to arrange goods on shelves.
"I used to have an hour to unload the new batch, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government should have taken and completely banned cigarettes, we would have said: what to do, okay, it's all over, we're closing the store," he says, raising his hands.
Missing the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane, which we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna fool you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and books, magazines, iPhones, even duty-free shops will not help much.
However, in recent times, more and more scientists and specialists in child development are speaking in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss is not so bad.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us.
Perhaps we need to strive for boredom?
Oh, yes.
And at the same time, it's not.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many, that boredom was a relatively recent invention when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating from the first century.
The question remains as to how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research materials on this topic and asking a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: boredom is when people “want but can’t do what would bring them satisfaction.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person does not do something he would like to do.
I don’t want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in the boredom experienced, he says, is “a disturbance of attention and the associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is slowly stretching.”
As described, boredom can seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, missing people see the causes of problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we’re bored when in fact we’re just having a hard time focusing on something.
In his study “Unemployed Mind: Defining Boredom from Attention Point of View,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues cited a previous experiment in which participants listened to a voice recording reading the journal.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the case of the television program included in the neighboring room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so that they could hardly be disassembled, and the third group only listened to the recording of the voice without a foreign soundtrack.
Those participants who listened to low-volume TV noted that they were bored, more often than others - they were difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, distractions can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, looking at the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom.”
It is believed that when people begin to rock on a chair or draw crabs on a sheet of paper, they do so out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions simply help not to relax physically.
"The study found that children who are not forbidden to wander and wander learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit quietly," Fenske said.
At times we all get bored: with a flight delay (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show different degrees of propensity to boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “boring propensity scale” to measure such individual characteristics.
To determine the assessment on such a scale, questions and statements are used, for example, "A lot of what I have to do is uniform and monotonous" or "I have too much interest, so there is not enough time for anything."
Using such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys miss girls more often, says Steven Vodanovic, a professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida, especially with a variety of external stimuli.
In general, however, teenagers are often missed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he interacted with nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
32% of teenagers said they were bored at school and while doing homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data would be about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “teenage age has a peak of boredom” mainly because children and teenagers are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let’s return to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes it doesn’t, because in extreme manifestations, research shows, it can push people to absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling, or substance abuse in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to studying this problem.
“So our brain tells us to do something else; that’s boredom,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, the brain itself does not always know what to do better.
If you get bored and you focus that energy on playing the guitar or cooking experiments, you’ll do better.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations,” he says.
Your child not only learns to do something on his own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think boredom has to be praised.
However, it is not worth considering it as a bad thing either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of actions and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
“We see this in such a way that we need to experience boredom more often, even though boredom is an extremely unpleasant, inexhaustible desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
“In today’s world, we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses,” he says, “and when silence comes, we get lost and don’t know what to do.”
It is unclear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will apply.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football team player and a public college student in southeastern Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offense that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: storing a small portion of his marijuana and pipes.
Mr. Orosco says that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamar and were driving in a car across the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in a car, Mr. Orosco was ordered to appear in court for drug possession and possession of a device for drug use - small offenses, each of which is fined $100 - and a date for the trial was set.
“We are treated like criminals,” Mr. Orosco said.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize marijuana use in small amounts for entertainment, the solution of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law, but on the place of consideration.
Accusations of minor marijuana-related offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people aged 21 and older with storing small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force in a few weeks.
However, in the more conservative Colorado counties, prosecutors have decided to consider existing marijuana cases and are still prosecuting for storing the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, they are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from appearing in their locations.
“It’s all happening so fast that I don’t even know what to expect next,” said Daniel J. Outs, a police chief in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of the controlling authorities in the state of Washington are also intrigued to scratch their heads.
They will have to establish rules to determine the procedure for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with marijuana use, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“Colorado has a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Council for Regulating the Production and Sales of Alcohol Products in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than to make some suggestions and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we could focus on,” he says.
The Washington state bill, dubbed I-502, will come into force on December 6 and will put the state in a state of uncertainty for a whole year when state licensing systems are not yet in place and the right to own marijuana has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's order on "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on its trade at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses in urban areas, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly established Marijuana Legalization Center research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Outs emailed his subordinates that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer hold people under the age of 21 to account for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police were stopping the moment of "detecting" people in these violations.
Police chief Outs said police would monitor the city’s compliance with regulations governing the activities of people growing marijuana for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal traffickers and drug dealers.
Weld County District Attorney for Northern Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a more rigorous approach to the issue.
Following the vote on the bill, he stated that the prosecution would continue to hold the possession of marijuana accountable, mainly to encourage its users to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 people have been charged with storing two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
“It is the duty of our institution to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission,” Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was ambiguous even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where the voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer holds adults responsible for possessing a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger backed the decision, but also decided not to dismiss the charges in already open cases related to marijuana storage.
“I believe it is our direct responsibility to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents who took part in the vote supported this decision, including the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of residents in different parts of the state exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to the state experiment with marijuana.
“The district attorneys have a cultural barrier in this matter,” explains Sean MacAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of those convicted of marijuana possession, and a local representative of the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They’ve been harassing people for so long that they can’t really accept that it’s not a crime anymore,” he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat marijuana in the same way as alcohol, are destined to become a nationwide experimental field to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are cautiously awaiting instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope that the Office of Justice will give way in this matter.
Despite several widespread arrests of drug traffickers and medically abused patients, the federal government has in most cases sanctioned the medical marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau of Drugs are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they will hardly close their eyes to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, according to Kevin A. Sabet.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana stores, which would not have been opened before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position to give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,” says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservative.
Persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of enrolling in Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the world's best educational institution, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium laying the two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
Yet, after two weeks of studying at the Faculty of History at Oxford University’s Wooster College in the late eighties, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends were misunderstood.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I had to leave because I had to drink from the crumbly cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
Not at all because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I was in private school.
I was only poisoned for one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it looked like true barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You might ask, why do you think about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students who adhere to right-centered views are subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those granted to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the Corpus Christi College Student Club in Cambridge say they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the College ' s Equal Rights Committee in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by a recently released BBC 2 documentary about politics in the student environment "The Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right", in which conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association who rides a rolls-crown, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver cane.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are making “goats of dismissal due to higher tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, said in an interview with one of Sunday's newspapers that "in the university environment, the bias towards left-wing views is increasing.
People who don’t even know us, in advance, consider us ruthless and impunity-ridden children of wealthy parents.
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at Corpus Christi College's historic faculty, who filed a request for protection, calls such an atmosphere "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Association of Conservatives, said that the student's attitude towards the club's members was "uncomfortable".
“This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of the club members,” she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just a minority, I was alone.
I entered there in September 1986, a shy and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford had a fever of hatred for the conservative party.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the first week, when students get to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time what awaits me.
I had no idea that not only did the teachers look through their fingers at the torture of conservative students, but they also enjoyed participating in it.
Political issues – miners’ strike, privatization, and the government’s refusal to impose sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa – penetrated the walls of the auditoriums lined with wooden panels.
In my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now deceased Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very bile-like person with a face similar to a cake.
"Thatcherists don't basically teach French, or they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students were cheeky.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few initial lessons of French in your spare time, if you are not, of course, very busy spinning around in society," Pitt whispered.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I sat alone for lunch; then someone slapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English language faculty, who presented himself as a member of the University’s Association of Conservatives.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone suspected of sympathy with the Conservatives will be harassed.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be harder for you.
Most conservative first-graders pretend to be Labourists.”
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hypocritize.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick failed.
A first-year student at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students took his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
“How do conservatives have sex?” one of them asked.
- They're biting each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the abolition of prosecution in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour Party and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years have seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn’t hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only because he belonged to the Conservatives, but also because he was Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of her speakers.
He hardly showed up in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettyness, and commitment to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to drive to Oxford from a parent’s home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased friends in the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, any political views were adopted there.
“It’s the best university in the world,” he said.
- They can't do that, except in the city of dormant spires...
Even my communist friends always behaved flawlessly.”
His wet eyes blurred.
“Don’t make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was exhausted by constant trips to London and my emotional defense was weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, could not withstand the pressure and abandoned his beliefs.
The next week during the seminar, when another history teacher called me “the enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Burning with shame, I confessed that "my parents were brainwashed" and called them "old fools."
The break was short.
The last nail in the lid of the grave of my career in Oxford was destined to smash my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Murdoch’s publications.
My door was locked.
I did not go out, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and boarded the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a plax and a scumbag.
But at eighteen, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational institution.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford who not only released the fourteen prime ministers of the Tories, but still hides behind the undeserved reputation of the university, in which equality and freedom of thought are valued.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of “Valentino: Master of Sewing”, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his “home” over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "Il Signore" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of knowledge.
The first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, will feature personal letters and photographs signed by the most eminent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Santal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a modest porter from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to an idol of the international “elite”.
To be in love with the royal court - there is nothing wrong with that.
“They don’t at least extinguish the smoke of their cigarettes on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all really liked to come to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of Heini Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Anelli or Evgenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
Despite this, he is a star.
Valeria Macca, representing Valentino
Argentinian model Valeria Macca recalls a charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner at his house, it was after a fashion show on the Plaza de España in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the junior.
Valentino's style was manifested in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decor, in food, in music.
“Each of the guests made Valentino feel important and loved,” recalls the top model, whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the Paris Fashion Week.
“He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
Parade of genealogy
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of the Somerset house was turned into a glamorous podium of sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must defile on the podium, contemplating the "spectators" of the gems, which glitter with masterpieces of Valentino, such as s
In this audience of models shine such names as Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abascal and fashion designer, 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino's first love is "impossible to forget."
I remember him very well.
These were trousers, a shirt, a "vest" and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Nati Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria added.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they “approach” his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion lawmaker Patricia della Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino either.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets.
The time finally came in the late 90s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it for a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with buckles, a corset in a fold and a neckline without straps.
"It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from the fashion designer with "maximum caution ... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories accompanying it."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Santal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion designer calls his seams) to make this dress from ivory silk with an inlay of pearl, twelve kinds of different lace and a loop of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone in the high fashion of the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers from the upper world."
Stunned by the elite’s “lifestyle” for many years, Valentino is now his own best representative.
The Knight of the Great Cross (a mark of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Knight of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Literacy, awarded with the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and flawless appearance," recalls d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was impeccable, there is no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The world's heaviest profession: miners from Kawah-Idgen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano on steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn a living from sulphur mining in the Kavah Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where sulfurous gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes when in contact with air.
He cut off huge pieces of sulfur, whose total weight can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, throws the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up on a rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, whose height is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters, but exhausted loaders take more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle step, difficult to maintain balance and carefully tapping the road so as not to fall back and fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as happened with one tourist from France, who fell off the rocks of Kawah-Idgen a few years ago.
Miners from Kawah Ejina earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
On the top, they pave their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from the circus and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the weights that the mining company placed a little above, at a height of 1,850 meters.
It is about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been exploiting this volcano since 1960 and, better yet, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to petrochemical production, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
“As the norm is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each run,” explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily transports.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems miserable for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than he would have earned in the field.
“The miners’ wages are very high according to local standards, where coffee is collected by 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly earnings is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the trucker, who previously worked as a quarryman on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town not far from the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as crushing as the sulphur: "I married her, the girl from the bay
Anto has asthma, he breathes hard, coughs constantly, and his eyes run down due to toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah-Ijen, whose sulfur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, he coughs constantly, and his eyes faint because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to work another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he said in more than acceptable English.
Punished with life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or gatekeeper in a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
For a dirty wooden hut with other wearers, it rises every day at two o’clock in the night, because the sulfur does not stop leaking at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating his way with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself bought for his money.
About 400 carriers pull baskets with grey on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur production to save costs and does not provide any equipment to bearers who work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don’t even get part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photo fee, which, along with a 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) ticket, guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mule people.
“This job is for cattle, not for people,” says Badrussin, a 42-year-old root-bearer who has spent three decades at Kavah-Ijene since leaving college.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will tolerate work “as much as he can” because he needs money to educate his three children aged 18 to 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so resilient that no one complains of their severe diseases...these are more serious problems, obviously, than their nails.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades lift 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming an 18-kilometer distance along a narrow path among the dams.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unainik says, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the heaviest occupations in the world: what human mules do with Kawah-Idgen.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and housing and education prices for the absence of children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, let's do our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the mint advertising, but despite this – or possibly because of this – this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put the bao (bulk) in the oven" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is hoping that with the help of advertising, they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their “national duty.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce like ourselves, so we felt that this was the topic we had to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, such as run perfumes with pheromones or organize fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely write rap?
1.2 Children's
Whoever doesn’t take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its leadership conservatism and strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 – known as the replacement percentage – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Administration, says the reason for this is “improved education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, besides getting married and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of singles and the delay in marriage and childbirth, resulting in a decline in birth rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which aims to dramatically increase immigration to counter population decline, is causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where barely hidden xenophobia thrives against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and unwillingness to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party got the worst result in the election since independence last year.
After the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in fertility has some impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical spending, and immigration policy, Singapore’s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making every effort not to build so little housing.
For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Guide has gone on to control the number of small apartments known as a "shoe box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters are very well sold.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a hollow lifestyle and deprive developers of incentives who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” are sold much faster than larger ones.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold out for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our monetary income increases.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers who were previously put in the way if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Excessively stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center, they don’t seem to have much effect.
“People are very tense, housing is expensive, as is education, and that’s why many people postpone it,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and housing and education prices as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, the last word remains with Singaporeans when it comes to childbirth.
Personal in offline - personal in online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language, this is a property of private or "privacy sphere, which they have the right to protect from any interference."
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when discussing situations on the Internet that he would certainly not share outside the Internet?
elPeriódico interviewed five guys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” in the personal plane, and “password and username,” when applied to social networks.
“I wouldn’t upload my biggest secrets to a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I am also having fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or someone who behaves stupidly,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is inappropriate to post indecent photos of naked people, crimes or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they’re answering me, I’m just uploading them,” he adds.
“Social media is entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or to my friends quickly,” he says.
Without thinking, he replies that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't count with someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his friends list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he said.
According to the boy, no one frowned at him and asked for his home address or phone number.
“If I’m pressured or demanded, I’ll just delete them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now known as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Only included confidentiality."
It then explains the sequence of steps for setting up an account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I don't like a person or if I want to.
“Although I know it’s cybermobbing,” he confirms.
KEY QUESTIONS
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and an education specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she said.
Porras points out that academician Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the paper Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
“We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning ourselves,” she says.
He explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken at an age when maturity is lacking.”
“Also to make them selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or would you like to have a photo of you posted like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they should behave online as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, and so should social media,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good grounds for conversations with children about the prerequisites for opening an online account.
“For example, the age and what is allowed to be disseminated or published,” he says.
According to Gaurdi, the key issue is to remind children of the lesson "do not talk to strangers".
UNASUR Summit Ends Without Promulgation of Lima Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the proclamation of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the VI regular meeting of the Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the main page that it would be transmitted after closure, but then confirmed that at some point it would be published to the Government on the Per
Asked about the text, they indicated that the contents were outlined by Peruvian President Oliant Umala during brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly without sound with the message "closed meeting, sound prohibited" was broadcast in the press room.
Few of the information circulated among the reporters was communicated by press secretaries of some of the UNASUR Governments present at the meeting, but not from Peru.
The only document circulated throughout the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused discontent among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian presidential administration sent an electronic message to the media with the summit's "final declaration", but this is about Umala's statement, not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite the press’s insistence, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was also not circulated.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but limited the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
Presidents of Peru, Olián Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins on Monday in The Hague, as part of the indictment Lima has filed against Santiago.
"We will comply with and enforce a decision that will clarify the disagreements we are currently presenting to this international court," Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, pacts and international tribunals," Piñera added, and welcomed Umalu's handshake against the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice came just after Colombia protested this week against the Bogota Pact, under which it recognized the submission to the verdicts of that international court following the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered erroneous.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR was suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Oliant Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, a little later in the afternoon at Lima time.
The head of state read out the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and the directions of action for 31 projects among South American countries were approved, the amount of expected investments amounted to $ 17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the agreements on the place of residence".
He said that action is being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizens' uncertainty and against organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, affordable Internet access in all corners of South America, and to take account of the risks of natural disasters in an aggregate and effective manner."
As Europe is in crisis, “economic unification (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the president said in a statement.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belong to Peru, and are limited by the transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-joining the Union of South American Nations,” she said.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between neighbours was another theme underlined at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before taking part in the regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to hold negotiations in a respectful form about the sea dispute.
"After tomorrow (Saturday), maybe I'll meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussions with Nicaragua," he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope I will be able to tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also at the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the issue of protecting the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although participation of the latter has been suspended.
Peru has an interim presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe on the issue of citizenship integration": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peruvian state television that Europeans “killed each other during World War II” and other clashes, “but now they are practically one homeland.”
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing South American citizenship, which was approved by the UNASUR member countries.
“We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president has also shown himself to be in favour of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret the decision, because with it he did not betray his principles, but he respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at the time “there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be complied with.”
He also criticized the Swedish justice for requiring it to arrive in his territory for questioning about an alleged sexual offence, while "only Swedish law considers it possible to implement it through videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of Assange’s physical and mental health deterioration.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," he said.
What really exists is the danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the ability to do exercises in the air.
“It affects everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum given to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of inviolability that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judiciary, and stressed that the solution of the problem was that there were negotiations in London.
We are not negotiating on human rights, this word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European institutions,” he said.
He said: “If the UK provides a guarantee of inviolability tomorrow, it will be over.”
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, tomorrow the problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to demonstrate himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate "mediality, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression."
“The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support profits, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this respect, he remained pleased that these journalists, “neither bankers nor bourgeois hegemonic countries dominated Ecuador,” and added that being re-elected “would deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto on UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support coups under the guise of legitimacy", because in reality "it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered “completely justified” his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos’ desire to negotiate now with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of the Nicaraguan maritime suvereign.
This decision is not being complied with at the moment.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to deal with them together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed hope for a good settlement of the dispute over maritime borders, which is being held in the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international instances if the two countries commit to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be".
As for the opportunity to run as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term in a row, he said he considers this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations as Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, the same.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he went for treatment, which was already scheduled, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean that President Chávez’s health is deteriorating,” he said.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Aids mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test had a positive result.
“I feel like I’ve been deaf,” he recalls, despite all the doctor’s tact, the difficult moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were justified - he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “oldest” HIV patients at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was hospitalized in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with a diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe - there were too few treatment options then, too little knew about the disease, too biased towards patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, having AIDS at the time was a condemnation.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do it without deteriorating the quality of life.
However, not knowing about their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged, "depleted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a major achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," - said the head of the HIV department of HCG, Khaimah Andrade.
Infectionist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008 scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system available to patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, the life expectancy, with the best continued
Simply put, the above means that those who are diagnosed HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “maintaining control, will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years,” he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Khalisko alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there is ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still fatalities?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, that's how things are in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medications, the problem is that patients come very late because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to conduct a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection that are mass-scale, for all people.”
In their proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Khalisko (COESIDA) agree, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who applied for an examination in a private laboratory, motivated only by the fact that it was done by his friend and, despite his young age.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd better go three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercise, take medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person," - said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to motivate his statement of the day with the fear of those who now, in the context of the world.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them find out as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them find out that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the shelf
There is a big gap between health programs and a simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has dealt with an HIV-related problem.
The biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "in fact, the distribution of condoms has increased, we used to be given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, and that is very good, but it turns out that there are those who do not yet have access to a condom," - he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
“Why are they for you?” is a popular question, with contempt and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers and health care workers who don’t want to hear from teenagers, the propagandist said.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms be not only behind the counters and that hundreds of them be in vending machines in public toilets in places that young people often visit.
That's not encouraging fornication.
It’s not about paying for beer and a motel, Governor Emilio González replied when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
“It’s not sexuality, it’s best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.
Key data in Khalisko
There were 13,435 total cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and total cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections refer to the genital tract, 6% through blood and 2% to the perinatal tract.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people on one recorded case who do not know about it.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the decision that annuls the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a definite precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has problems with fees.
The procedures to support the survival of firms, which are allowed by Mexican laws, do not appear to be valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the approval of Judge Harlin Hale’s June 15 ruling in the Northern Texas District Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican firms vulnerable to the possibility of arrest on their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the order opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to refer to the Supreme Court of the United States, citing three discrepancies.
As an introduction, while the case judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says the main proceeding concerns a competitive proceeding underway in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, designating the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without an inter-company vote, the critically competitively incurred debts that the Vitro subsidiary had before the parent company would not have reached the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Manufacturing.
It is also true that, by subtracting the votes of the branches, somehow the Vitro creditors who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the foundations of the “stormcats” such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal omits this information.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, afflicted by a serious economic crisis that hit the United States by striking the country.
So far, the Gonzales Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote will reach its plenary, that is, five judges, given that only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be submitted, which will require a review of the proceedings by the Supreme Court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae ("the other court"), describing the process that follows Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it is waiving itself from complying with the agreements signed by both countries to bind it to Article 15 of the Law.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors.
Carambole from two sides: they beat in Vitro and beat in country.
Total balance
Given the months-long complaints put on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gastón Ascarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Trade Union Pilots Association of Aviators has already discovered the bumps.
The body, headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic regarding the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trust fund of IXE Bank F/589, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be directed to the purchase of shares of the professional hotel management company.
As you know, Ascaraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Around the Dragon Mart
Meeting over the weekend at a forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country of the country’s isolated products, with a residential area nearby for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeast zone to confront the monumental forces that leveled off part of the protected areas and posed serious threats to the industry.
Death of ACTA
Regarding the government's rejection of the Senate's demand to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed a trade agreement to combat counterfeiting, known as an abbreviation in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, this case has already gone into effect.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of considering it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to repay long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, Homex puts 500 million pesos of stock certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with an offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitiveness comes to light
Formed by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with the trade name Competival has just emerged, its goal will be the software cluster services market in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $ 1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetty" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The avid basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetty" Reyes.
After all, before the brain bleed tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a small-tier player, senior basketball league player, commissioner and head of BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys and President.
“I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of BSN, director general of the National Team and president of the federation in the 1990s,” Reyes recalls during a visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his 50-year-old daughter.
“Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and souvenirs collected for his long journey, testify to this.
The Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when it was 15 years of his performance as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be a part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships that took place between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincie's debut on BSN.
From that moment onwards, Cuco Ortiz, who was a great administrator, was in charge,” Reyes said.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was coming here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"Would you?"
And that was the start of Minci, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who gained citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincie had brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped to win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys Championship with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and the achievements of Minci in the national team.
I remember winning for the first time in the United States during the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got the fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not the Canadian referee who made us win the final game, Reyes said.
Is that team from the 1990 World Cup the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and beat the U.S. national team, which was pretty similar to the one that won the bronze at our World Cup.
Not only did Minci, Gauss, Ramón Rivas, Fico Lopez and 'Piculina' (Ortis), but also the young (Javier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihoto' Isle-of-the-Morales.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of staffing, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With players such as Canito Nieves, Pablo Aliseo and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily suspended for the disorder in the Pan American Mar del Plata Championship, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculin did.
And that’s not to mention his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good youngster, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armando Torres.
From a young age, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s, BSN had up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have left to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that the boys from Ponse play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that’s superfluous.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and coursework for managers, officials and judges.
It's a pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-famous for his lead role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the Dallas TV series, in which he portrayed a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died Friday night from complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas-based production studio.
“Larry is back in his favorite hometown of Dallas again, playing the iconic role he liked the most,” his family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original personality and lived a full life,” Grey said in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained fame on television due to his role of a decent type in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive jinn girl played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under one roof.
He also starred in two comedies that rarely aired, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-received roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the pinnacle of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its vicinity aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The ad slogan “Who Shot J.R.?”, designed to create a buzz around an emotion-packed episode in which Hagman’s character is nearly killed, spawned international discussions and millions of dollars risked in bookmakers.
It also helped attract a record-breaking audience to the show at the time.
When it was responded to in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH finale, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (performed by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. thwarted her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of town, but others had reason to attack him as well.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be placed on treatment.
"I know what's supposed to be on J.R.'s grave plate," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be said, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's ever lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "huge, both on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new release "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement as to what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in such classic works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to her lawyer, Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theatre scenes in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he released his memoir Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t include anything that I thought could hurt anyone or affect them in any way,” he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who were afraid.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery, and then,” he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer some comfort, like “don’t be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable in a short time, but you’ll be okay.”
He also actively advocated against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Starts a course that explores "The End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when professor of religion Stuart Charme decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible bait: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long countdown” on December 21, which many people caught up with as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was expected in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Sandy hurricane, the financial crisis that some call “Long Armageddon,” and the growing conflict that Israel will be dragged into, a place where end-time Christian theorists believe will begin.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what’s going on in the world right now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only professor to offer “end of the world” courses this semester, theoretically the latest in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Waker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios that trigger certain human actions are offered.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I tried to tell the students that maybe it’s probably plausible and impossible,” Waker said.
At the University of Pennsylvania’s main campus, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to read a course called simply “The End of the World.”
“We’re not adding ‘2012’ to always be able to read the course again in case the end of the world doesn’t come,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students must learn, prepare projects and pass final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
“Sites are over in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-average students, which enrolled 35 students.
We received email messages for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there were any more places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I love watching what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridget Robinson, a 23-year-old student at the Department of Religion and Sociology in Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student in the psychology and nursing department, said he watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach this," he noted.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed — not to mention the professor — said they believed in the end date of the world on December 21.
“Our first project touched on the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old undergraduate at Temple University in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it was just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has been counting for several centuries, where people react to the changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about it,” he said.
Especially in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Doherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew of any course about the “end of the world” there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the superior authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that for a long time there was talk of many days of the Last Judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are seamless on this date.
Some say they're going to end-of-the-world parties.
“Maybe I’ll call some of my friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
