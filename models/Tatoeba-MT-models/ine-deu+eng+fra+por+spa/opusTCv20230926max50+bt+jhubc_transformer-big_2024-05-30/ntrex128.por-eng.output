Deputies of the Assembly of Wales fear "passing through Marretas"
There is consternation on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) over the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Wales Parliament Members).
The origin of this controversy lies in plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them ridiculed.
A Labour AM said the group is concerned that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrements".
A Plaid spokesman said the group as a whole was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the change of name, but said the MWP designation was verbally too close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to the letter u in English of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how the Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave its Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received widespread support for the proposal to designate the Assembly as the "Welsh Parliament".
On the question of the title of the MEPs, the Commission favoured "Wales Parliament Deputies", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently suggesting alternatives, but the effort to unite the consensus could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to come forward with a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the House performs its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of MPs and the set-up of the commission system.
When they discuss the legislation, the AMs will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians to Referendum on Change of Country Name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which integrates a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor’s name constitutes a complaint about its territory, and has repeatedly objected to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is no more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Signs Silent at a Time when Harlem Churches Fight for Survival
“In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
"The bars have ceased to be the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly head."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the starting point.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not support the remaining neighborhood sanctuaries.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore such will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, as it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was then built by a black congregation that performed its worship in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who touched the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also reported that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the major carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the secular church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it would "try to pass on the costs", regretting that it had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Teen on Lobster Hunting Scuba Diving in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, then rowing towards him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but later realized the boy was yelling "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
The entire area of the clavicle was torn, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
Authorities closed access from Point Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with departments of cosmetics in the style of large warehouses, supported by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which has continued to grow as fashion clothing and household items sales recede, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be implemented in more successful stores in the year.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand on the part of supermarkets for ways to use the exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would duplicate its beauty product catalogue with offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees ranges will also get more space with brand areas similar to those of stores like Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products comply with vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the shift from grocery shopping habits to small daily amounts in nearby stores have led to supermarkets now having to do more to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, executive chairman of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses as the supermarket chain tries to combat Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, having also installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this has strengthened grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from health products stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-point pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company was told that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skin care brands in four stores such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
On the other hand, the welcoming atmosphere and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby quit <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby left a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Truly household goods and accessories brand.
The business of both had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced on Instagram that she would quit the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons star Den Peter Jones alive by leaving the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was "furious" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (which could amount to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) meant she would no longer have time to dedicate herself to her brand.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While 37-year-old Willoughby was announcing on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his vacation homes abroad.
A source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
It would mean resolving its future in the long run and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely astonished.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe the departure of the presenter of This Morning, which is among Britain’s most lucrative bids, could cost the company millions, given the advancing investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for additional launch delays.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we don't intend to comment on your business."
Hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
The US president jokingly mentioned the criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his fake voice of "newspaper pawn".
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, saying it would be a big step in North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that the North does not see a “correspondent response” from the U.S. to North Korea’s first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the deadly remains of the US military.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he spoke about relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been evicted, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for the international aid pipeline.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases made it clear that they are not asking for international aid, so it becomes a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team that will head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the wraths of nature.
Although built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, badly the validity of a warning, would have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo, who has made infrastructure improvements a central part of his election campaign, has spent huge amounts on roads and railroads.
However, the funding shortage hit Mr. Joko’s executive at a time when he faces his re-election next year.
The president is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catans, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long finish for the tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing 1-0.
He tapped to his left before making a rebound towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving forward as much as possible, so I was just winning as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I gave him a touch and I didn't think about it too much. I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the interval after scoring a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that play, the forward of the blues gave a heel-back pass to Mateo Kovacic before detaching near the midfield and sprinting towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
He then made a beautiful finish that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the large area.
He overtook the defences and scored against the second-string net with a left-footed rebound that passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster response agency said on Sunday.
There are reports that a large number of people trapped in the debris of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters in height, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the debris of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbed woman to death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged the local people who may have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all those who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious contacting us.
I also want to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images with apron cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us, as they may have crucial information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the scene to inquire about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are underway, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim’s close relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to access his apartment, but has been informed by police that entrances or exits of the building are prohibited.
When he was informed of what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes within hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He says repeatedly that “it’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the immediate outer area.
A number of police officers were deployed inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask anyone with information to contact DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament became the most recent monument swallowed up by the fight of "historical revisionism"
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, which recalls the perpetrated by the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current debate over the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure at Westminster Palace would become a target to be shot down.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony to 19th-century opinion and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety representing one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration.”
Pig Killer Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and blood-covered artery, near a market pit in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reads the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring barn.
In that pocilga, he said, was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 227-pound pig had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and crushed,” said the cousin, referred to by his nickname “Wu,” according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 440 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Reports say Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pork attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as a “stimulus.”
"They're just kidding.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. East Sunday, Rosa caused a Category 1 hurricane of 137 km/h (620 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical moisture toward the north in the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rainfall can cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris swamped, and possibly landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly discouraged to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rainfall can cause the gorges to turn into raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring heavy rainfall over parts of the southern California coastline.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause small piles of debris and slippery roads.
This could be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to occur in Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October may experience strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but tropical zones will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is an excellent example of drastic temperature differences across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 11-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to rise and widen again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern U.S. zone recorded a hot start in October, with temperatures spreading between 27 and 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern U.S. until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations yesterday the staggering testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political stalemate continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute reversal: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her while drunk and tried to strip her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, a figure determined by Nielsen on Friday, have attended the hearing.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring audiences of those who watch programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of audience similar to the final of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long audience, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by CNN and CBS chambers on Friday morning being verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to enter an elevator to address a Judiciary Commission hearing.
The senator remained motionless staring at the floor as he was criticized directly at the CNN cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told that “you have power while so many women have no power.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator door closed, he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event in direct hours later, when the Judiciary Commission went to vote to make Kavanaugh’s appointment proceed for a plenary vote in the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, which the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and subsequently with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake’s choice was decisive, as it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politicizing' Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “politicising” Britain’s future and harming national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on what is known as the minister’s “Chequers Plan” for Brexit, stating that a proposal that foresees Britain and the EU to cover the other party’s tariffs is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson of LSU Player Death
Police arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police claiming that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA in them, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had fatally hit Wayde with a gun.
A bail of $350,000 was established, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge parish forensic office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and residents who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local authorities for their “diligence and effort to get justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 highlights per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what we’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash in Mexico City
Ash emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano has hit neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Sunday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between separatist protesters and police intervention, as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, blocked by police intervention, hit her with eggs and threw powder ink, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to sticks to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independentist groups singing "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-sensitive region, a year after the October 1 referendum that was considered illegal by Madrid but was held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the turnout to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those opposed.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations scattered throughout the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The separatist groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it was carried out, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year, we had our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we’re blocked,” he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep up the momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year's elections.
"Messing up as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we see on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have fired a beast at the car.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second loss of just two in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga’s attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt’s team changed levels, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team, which continues without a home win in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders, with another eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
However, Livingston extended his succession of games without defeat in the division to six games, with head coach Holt without losing a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunities Against Stupid Visitors
Holt’s team should have advanced on the scoreboard long before the goal, as the incisive character of his game was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but let himself be dragged in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort away after sneaking to find Craig Halkett's headline on the beacon.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems to visitors in the stop-ball plays.
And that’s how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At this point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another Livingston stop ball play.
Crossings continued to come to the large Livingston area, which were successively settled, and two high-penalty claims, one after Halkett's investiture on replacement Glenn Middleton and another after one hand, were rejected by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for how he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall at their best throughout the game.
In any case, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality demonstrated sometimes with Gerrard, the team was far below these standards.
Their final move was little inspired (only once they were able to open the home team), providing a kind of warning for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Receives Ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside its own country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters marked presence in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisionist character of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, near 10:15 British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on the spot.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway collision on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the person and inform their relatives.
Barriers and deviations were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The unrest, which is still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Saturday.
Special Agents "Tornado" have been summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A Prison Services spokesman said: “Specially trained teams have been used to solve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, police intervention officers were summoned to solve a serious disorder in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Pink Hurricane Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with Sudden Floods (Drought Affected Areas May Benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday to the areas of southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
The Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm on the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the rain of the Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this precipitation can be beneficial as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most severe category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the continental mass crossing the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is located 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is weakening.
Thus, it is expected to hit the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at nightfall on Monday.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which raises a significant risk of flooding.
“Total precipitation of 8 to 10 mm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 mm possible,” weather.com said in a statement.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. This will then head south of Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
“The main expected danger of Rosa or its debris is the very high precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Southwestern Desert of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce sudden and strenuous floods of debris in the deserts, at risk of life, and avalanches on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were detained on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teen was found injured in the area of Midsomer Norton’s Excelsior Terrace near 4 a.m. British summer time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area were detained during the night, Avon and Somerset police said.
The agents have appealed to everyone who may have mobile phone footage of the incident that they present themselves.
Trump says Kavanaugh was “victim of the malice and rage” of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was “victim of the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party during its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied an accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" on that day.
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote by one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president sideways referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m actually competing,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy to the Republican leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; number continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them dragged by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation along their way.
The tsunami occurred in the wake of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of what happened,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency to mitigate the effect of Indonesia’s catastrophes (BNPB) in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, deformed and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings were found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves appeared at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage posted on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to the people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power cut that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic goods.
The city’s airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to Palau evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is increasing exponentially to more than 800.
It's really bad.
Although he managed to get safely to the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of their offices, Donggala’s World Vision staff went through scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid groups began to begin the grim tasks of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still at a provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says 'OK, this is a national catastrophe' we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist."
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the still missing still held the hope that their loved ones would become part of the miracles that mitigate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days beside her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the Hotel Roa Roa collapse began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s athletes, who were attending the beach festival.
However, their messages produced only one gray check mark, instead of a pair of blue ones.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves Take $26,750 During ATM Refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was replenishing an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "surged to run behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being previously known to Kanye West.”
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace the one of the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", said the creator of the show.
While an abbreviation for his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, when he commented on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"Therefore, I am you, I am we, we are we.
It comes from Kanye, which means “the only one,” for only Ye – being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is yet another reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO commits not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have amounted to 300 when leftist student movements were deployed throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting them monthly grants to those who study and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
U.S. to double funding for artificial intelligence
At a time when China is reinforcing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this area, said investor and professional from the area Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made AI-related announcements, even though the country does not have a global formal strategy on the matter.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
“Duplicating the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the odds of the next big success of AI being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's top-ranked American player. Later, he held executive roles at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's China branch.
Lee gave credit to previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Department of Defense Agency’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s stealing academic leaders; it’s the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaires to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically awarded to AI doctorates,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of Next Generation Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Artificial Intelligence Restricted Committee.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment this month in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not advanced for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists its northern neighbor’s name represents a claim over its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout will be enough to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Is it in favor of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the admission efforts in bodies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no records of irregularities until one o'clock in the afternoon.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
"I have come to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on changing the country’s name, which would open the doors to its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to stick with our heads up and not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favor, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major breakthrough in pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses the entire defense of Brighton towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overturned Brighton's 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He made a sprint between three defenses of Brighton before cutting to reach open field.
He was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pretended a defense before neutralizing in the race more others on the boundaries of the large area of Brighton.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with his right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed finish.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League confrontation.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball right on the territory of Brighton in that play.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave a few taps before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life harder for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there was not much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer has hopes to get on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, who hold a lead in a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their first division title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we can get on the pitch knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the highest level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete under these conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the lead pitcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the pitches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, had a session at the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right-hander from Washington goes 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president sideways referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones...I’m not competing, but I’m competing and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates.”
Trump continued, “You’re seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re seeing it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power using all necessary means. Are they seeing evil, deafness?
They don’t care who they assault, who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
Democrats, he said, have the mission of “resisting and obstructing.”
“And they’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “aggressive, bad, sordid and liars.”
The president referred to by the name Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, having received audible cheers from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did it cause the document to leak?
Hey, hey, what?
No, um, I, um, wait, one--that was a really bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
He is intolerant of those who openly give his opinion.
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
After all, I am the latest of a number of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we have openly expressed our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been the target of similar treatment because she has resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues with which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday mentioned that “we intend the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "most kind and gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if ever it has come true.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to take a turn and take positions with which he would never agree - whether they were on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there follows a torrent of insults on social media that appeal to “lay off,” denouncing the center’s policies, saying to myself that I shouldn’t belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am astonished by the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a dam of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down before them.
One of the aspects that disappoint me most in this age of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or change of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I’ve received countless advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, so as not to be so expressive, and that that way “it would be all right” for me.
But that's not why I came here to do politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in the rubble, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a mayor or as a minister in the government.
I never hid my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country heads for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on the theme of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "dismissal" or political files will prevent me from acting in what I believe is in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow sent the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one out of ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team lead the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They handle the risks better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute rehearsal, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the front, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's advantage with a big penalty, before, immediately before the halftime, scoring and then converting a solo rehearsal to put the scorer in 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the draw to five points.
A long interruption followed due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who was transported from Maca to the outside, and after the restart, Ayr reinforced the lead with a Stafford McDowall rehearsal converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense push.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Climo without the ball on the penalty throw, MacPherson placed the ball on the floor behind Ayr's in progress maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry to the house's fifth rehearsal.
Still Game Star Ready for a New Career in the Catering Business
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to enter the catering industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, which will debut soon, will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was intending to get involved in the "flowering Glasgow restoration business."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a landlocked country, expects the court to reopen a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval base covered in rope in La Paz.
Public buildings bear a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Getting it back is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will witness the ruling of the TIJ on giant screens scattered throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of their country’s claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” the president’s votes were last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if not.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ’s verdict is delivered only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and a possibility to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country trusting the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises it made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an “impossible dream” to consider that the continued sanctions and the U.S. objection to a statement that puts an end to the Korean War would ever cause the North to kneel.
Washington fears accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are planning a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang actually intends to reduce an arsenal that the country sees as probably the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the runway a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which stunned the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the walkway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide flap similar to a feather that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included crisscrossed jewelry watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, though they weren't designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colored masks had boiled lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they did with high seams.
One of the creations resembled diving gear, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to give continuity to this huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Styling observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
Oversized hats appear effervescent on the trail of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm tab that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that spread across social media sent another great creation to the walkways: a beach bag in straw almost as big as the swimsuit model that carried it.
The burnt-orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a white leather grip, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm waiting to see big hats and beach bags arrive in stores for next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, having this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for the deepening of their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of conceiving and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If we speak to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart.”
This quote reminds us well that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest utilization rates of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the maximum rating of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of the students obtained the maximum grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now addressed in the same way as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and more.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills concluded that 17% of the reasons for employers’ difficulty filling vacancies were related to language skills shortages.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for children today.
The mastery of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by teaching staff specializing in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scots.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will participate in Sunday’s pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is yet to be determined.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule in the pre-season.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump begins a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the conformational vote pending for his nominee for the Supreme Court seat, Trump intends to bolster support for the midterm elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below on a live YouTube stream.
Trump will likely address this week’s hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate confirmation vote scheduled will be on hold for a week as the FBI proceeds with investigations.
However, the main goal of this stream of rallies is to help Republicans, who face a tough election in November, gain some momentum.
Trump’s campaign officials said the five rallies next week aim to “energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so fundamental to the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the turmoil of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Set for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the early-night rally could attract supporters “from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get media coverage of the Pittsburgh area,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him with the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday’s singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum momentum oscillation is a fully invented sports concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum will come now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so we’re looking at it as a bit of a boost, I’d say,” Spieth said as he left the field at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those partying gusts were getting louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the 15th game produced a similar outcry, one that reveals that he still believes the American team remains in the competition.
“We just need to focus and worry about our own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four out of four and can’t go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European sunset victory at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, when in team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in front nine put the Spanish and the Swede in a hole they were never close to getting out of.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see from close up because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or don’t give and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant advantage in the final day. However, this foursome session also demonstrated that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a free edge after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday’s games with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
The duo inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to reach the four-point Le Golf National standings so far.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, fighting to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a failed American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more endurance in the foursomes with two wins, but failed to shorten the draw.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12th singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are just the only duet to win four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional genius hits, but has already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze southwest of Paris, Europe has not always taken the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of major men's tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duo got a courageous 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team reversed a four-point draw before the singles, though Furyk's title-holder team only needs to tie to retain the trophy.
After two days in second place, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says “not even thinking” about unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were exacerbating distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally waive its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test center and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we can proceed to our disarmament first."
Although Ri has recycled North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant in that they do not marginally reject previous denuclearization measures.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit held between a US president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, opposing even the ‘declaration of an end to war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the prolongation of sanctions is exacerbating our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party interested in this issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this deadlock.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korea’s rockets toward U.S. territory was unavoidable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump called Kim the “man of rockets” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for this, saying that “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must proceed vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to strangle North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile funding.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for "making demands of gangsters.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States “takes corresponding action.”
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they were seeking were Trump's security assurances in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has put all of its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the male culture of studying caffeine-infused “directs.”
One professor concluded that the students at this university at the top of the world ranking often had no idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should take for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you just telling me this in the last year of school?’
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep to her, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to pick up at bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “doing straight” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep enough and with quality should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid obesity, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical biology and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler conceive the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to consider using an alarm when going to bed, such as to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate the circadian rhythm and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of out-of-home sadness when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
The Ibrox team had sought to record their first victory on their route since the 1-0 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team eventually inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving their team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, the leader of the Scottish first division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and the Rangers collective, devoid of inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With the Rangers now descending to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third, and only behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
And more problems may arise for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence has received treatment for a head injury caused by an apparently thrown object from the visitor’s area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 from Livingston who stole a point from the Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with how his well-oiled team suffocated opponents in every move.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored soon after two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor goal, but the average missed his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second beam.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but the hope was greater than the belief in their game in the final third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been awarded a major quarter-hour penalty with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers scored only two goalless finishes in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's weak finish.
Although Livingston’s goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, at least not because of its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' long-standing ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved into the interval, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this swap almost had an immediate impact when the forward side moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long pass behind long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor did well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again claimed a major penalty when he embarked on Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request once again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old and continues to count ...born in Germany the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A key piece of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's really cracking right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave the name still persists.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to “see” harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory
These cells, which can “see” a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those in the breast, ovary, lungs and also colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
An approach similar to that involving removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe in support of Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was bullied in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his nightly song, Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he started a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white man and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump?
“Well, if you were concerned about racism, you would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star broke Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the scene of West's brawl was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to break West up when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had gone through a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They bullied me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go over there with that hat."
They bullied me!
And then they tell me I’m marginalized,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the marginalization?", saying that "I could put my superman cloak on, because that means no one tells me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try the love.”
His comments sparked public outrage and SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, having someone from the show told the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love It disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West received a statement of support from conservative TPUSA group director Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: "To one of our most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR THROUGH THE TURBA."
However, interview show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying West was simply “being what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is hosting and propagating ideologies that are harmful to the community.
He's free.
And we too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now "being previously known to Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The allegations will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
War of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his fencing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, War of the Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such roles on the screen often make boys feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old colleague in the War of the Thrones Rose Leslie, admitted that he has a "quite strong position" on addressing the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they’re growing up in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels to War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that, for him, the "battlefields and the horses" are over.
Starting in November, Kit will take part in a reissue of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing out of the War of the Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on.”
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple nodded in June 2018 on the property of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of homologous annual variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the country’s conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication since 2003 as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leak of information about Republican senators by one of her collaborators and attacks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team had published personal information of three U.S. Senate members on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were being promoted by opinion leaders and “ultra-right” websites.
“Lies, lies and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published data from a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by virtue of these fraudulent and false allegations, did not have any responsibility in this leak.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly attracted online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot get angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
It must reveal calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who will contest Waters’s place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “competent authorities” to these fraudulent allegations.
“We ensure that the culprits will be revealed and will be legally held accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff.”
Johnny English Review Back to Attack - Weak Spy Movie Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavour, and this seems to in fact apply to the new edition in the comedy and action film series Johnny English, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satiry about being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes blurred and an overly elastic expression, has obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, that this is a comprehensive comic creation intended for non-English-speaking cinematographers.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for the Barclaycard, which left chaos in his tracks.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English approaches a helicopter sweeping a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a groove noise against the helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for comedy is evident, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially given that “serious” movie editions like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We got the idea that humor is directed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misfortunes are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film numbers on Bean’s character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who incarnates a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total decay of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Her secret service advisers inform her that once all the agents in the asset have been committed, she will have to take someone out of retirement.
And this guy is the messy Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a chic school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an infiltrated spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering assistant Bough, role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, an elusive character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, the disaster Batman and Robin in the Secret Service of Her Majesty are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously bewitched by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous disastrous acts: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a spectacular French restaurant, they create confusion by penetrating as clandestine on the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with the interior of the house.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but as friendly and stormy as it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite mediocre.
And just like in the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but ask: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Workers deny that they are generating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but getting five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be pondering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day, but five-day, working week.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to pass on the savings with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, granting them an extra day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the orderly.
Sources say the idea "would be adjusted" to the party's economic program, which reorients the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day work week has garnered favorable opinion from the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, this aspiration is not favored at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party’s conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of “faceless directors” and “speculators” of basic service companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the entire share of the current shareholders of water companies, given that the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place workers on the company’s boards and create Inclusive equity funds that transfer 10% of the private companies’ share to employees, who will be able to pocket annual dividends that can amount to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can make them change their minds or not
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could figure out something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called you after this happened, when this allegation came up, and I asked you, "Did you?"
He was determined, determined, unmistakable.”
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I'm determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be necessary," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars who will act on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s Great Lawn, not only to watch performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the event’s true goal: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other significant ways that contribute to raising awareness for the purpose.
However, what has been the success rate of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of “clickivism” – do we think it makes a difference to sign a petition online or send a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters that have been pushing for a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to global leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, with at least $10 billion related to them having already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which has pledged to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote of history,” said Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, to a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions on the UK to improve mother and child nutrition, the government announced that it would fund a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the site’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replies: “It was a long and tortuous journey – sometimes we fell and failed.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use the Navy as a "blockade" to put an obstacle to Russia's energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington can resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, namely, where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the capability, with its navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to make blockades to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick magician" with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion Nord Stream pipeline, which aims to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, being an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, a senior official of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, said the Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "deeply examine" the possibility of running for president in the aftermath of the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the maximum responsible,” he said.
"After November 6th, I will consider in-depth the possibility of running for president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that “of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s constituents themselves are not of the opinion that she should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Research.
32% support your candidacy.
The poll revealed superior support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's post-traumatic stress at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after he’s back, I can identify with the other families that feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds that our soldiers actually come back with,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "return a little differently, come back hardened, come back inquiring if there is such respect for what his fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other members of the armed forces, have given to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a gun while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are giving their support to a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district sent a statement amicus curiae (court friends) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy has not been revealed.
The person said her partner "and her children, members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 Immigrant Resources Council decision that allowed immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle,” the statement reads.
Lawyers also argued in the statement that the police ban on the entry of immigrants negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "make the necessary workforce available".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a particular political opinion,” Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been destined to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death toll doubles on a counterclockwise to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35, the mother of a feverish male baby, while comforting him at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated abroad due to the strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears as he reported how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid China Daily supplement on the Des Moines Register, the most-recorded newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 congressional election, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides impose tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by publishing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“On the contrary, on the counters here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinions that the Chinese may have from their country’s worrying economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this could spark a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward for a vote.
These things have no setback,” said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to appease the upset voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is at the door!" as they protested in the Senate atrium, given that the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records," Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without party affiliation, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among the undecided voters in suburban areas and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans move forward with the confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge, it’s also about how Republicans dealt with the matter and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or absolutely lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI launched an investigation into Ford’s allegations, as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford was sworn in before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two attended a party during the period they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the intention behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse,” or POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal data warehouse online is that it is up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
Inrupt’s idea, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide the appropriate resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some in-house programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers across the globe will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about introducing or not a total change in which all of their business models are turned from head to toe.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: homage to clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman of the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his hometown for 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received the decoration on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the event that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable and machine guns."
He then ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage," led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three detachment soldiers.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know he would never be able to match, but also a lesson in humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is to be demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans wake up all night to watch Bellator 206 watch Peppa Nut instead
Imagine this: he wakes up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of vedettes, and in the end is prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six of the main group, and was broadcast live overnight on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, viewers in the UK were astonished when the coverage shifted to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after having been awake until dawn especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad taste joke.”
"Government regulation says the content is not suitable for six in the morning, so they had to switch to another schedule," Dave Schwartz, a marketing and communications administrator, told reporters.
"Peppa's ass," yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said the company will rectify the schedule of broadcasts to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock on Sunday morning there and we won’t be able to resolve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there were many messages exchanged and none very friendly.
We're trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not: it was a problem of the government.
I promise next time it won't happen.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and exaggerated.
This is a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ About His Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that it gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she had voiced in favor of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also claimed that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The program’s long-time regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took a several-month break due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls."
In her words, “to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and strength to achieve success.”
His goal was to prove he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to deminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “took me by surprise.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, although he claimed that the age difference was never a problem.
"When we go through it when we're so young" - his first participation in the Olympics was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last year in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all his perspective" had changed.
“If they had asked me last year, all that mattered was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Games because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you’re not going to be around to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics ... there was no better feeling," he said.
All of this was also the inspiration for her first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which she had identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British summer time.
Mickelson down in shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to regain his form to prevent the landmark from symbolizing an unhappy occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record stakes, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has so many times been in the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the major men's championships divided the day between the role of supporter and the work on his game on the field in the hope of rectifying what afflicts him.
Never having given straight kicks even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the National Golf course, where the long rough usually punishes the wandering kicks.
And if the field alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point downside starting the 12 singles games, register a good start, Mickelson’s game can prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role I had today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn’t even watched him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to move on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even matched the successes of your individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spirited, he likes to play with people and he's a great person to have in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun playing with him this week, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear in a blink of an eye
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his loose leadership on entering the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become an accidental ride.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the narrowest nose of the margins, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage at Valderrama; we had a big advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but for little," said Bjorn, in the image, after watching the 2018 Tour win by 5-3 on both Friday and National for 10 to lead.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the scoreboard.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that’s where the focus should stay.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world.
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never stand up to myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is the individual performance and that involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when we’re there on our own, our golfing skills are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they’re going to leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself too.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek for his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these great turns on the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe took the "Miracle in Medinah" off the map.
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 motivated his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this impetus turns to one side, the pressure is too great in these mid-parts.
We organized our staff accordingly and ordered the players the way we felt, you know, that we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the ranking.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the entire course," Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The latest German navy frigate should have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to breakdowns and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the command ship of the newest frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class commissioned by the navy in 2007 will be used to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include more extended periods between maintenance, which would allow sending the latest frigates on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the ongoing delays have meant that with state-of-the-art warships, considered as a way for Germany to design power across borders, they will already be out of date when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cites a number of crucial "hardware and software flaws" that would render the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software shortcomings were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the contingent needed in the oldest frigates of the Bremen class.
It is also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to install additional functionality in the future.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to have twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, an increase from the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems that plague the most recent frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
The politician said the problem grew exponentially over time, as older ships were put out of service without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as long-eared browns and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered throughout the property to follow bat activities throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and by volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to effect forest maintenance for bats and associated species.
Flea populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development work that affects the dormitories and make the habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, along with fly killer papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo locating technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly carry out studies, inspections of dormitories and sometimes rescues.
He also came to create the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, on the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property manager, David Thompson, says the same is the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Threave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot about bats we don’t know about, so the work we’ve done here and on the other properties will help us know more about what they need to flourish.”
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance on the properties, as the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don’t know how their populations are getting revenge.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges when his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly then paid $375,000 to keep the alleged victim silent about the accident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, characterized the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” said the five-Golden Ball winner.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy man and it’s all right,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as “an unacceptable report of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room, where he would have sexually assaulted her, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99%" "a good guy", harmed by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken at a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "terrified by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now says she intends to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU disorderly by the end of March, we will see production stoppages at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal at the level of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would shut down its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns pertain to what manufacturers claim are the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border disruptions, which the sector says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stocks at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said May’s “Chequers Plan” for future EU relations was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the seizing by us of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to move forward with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Although it could not give an estimate of the downtime, Toyota said that, in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and could, sooner or later, lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union at that location, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed another week" given there is still no agreement on Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The fact that Trump may be preparing the deputy attorney general’s dismissal, putting Mueller’s independence at risk, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording concealed conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week, given everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with such a statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said he would not disagree with the fact that they like the lead.
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding any evidence: "We have analyzed these numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this often and you have seen that we have done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that you can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences when he receives foreign representatives.
Press conferences on the ground are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way in front of the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about fears of Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to pay for applications for resident status of EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, with decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want them to continue here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers' Mike Organ said.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the sideline and practically fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie's oxygen in the sidelines before putting him on a maca and transporting him for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five sets on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his season total to 18 sets.
A higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp duty on foreign buyers who acquire properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in homelessness aid.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate
The increase in stamp duty will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable housing and tax higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will affect people and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to offer a roof to the homeless.
The surcharge – added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and lease purchases – could amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, raising prices and making it difficult for first home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp duty cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high by landing on land they do not use, demanding that Ms May abandon the quotas on affordable housing to resolve the "disgrace of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a set of appeals for housing reform proposals, including rent controls and the end of evictions “without justification.”
It also wants to assign to the municipalities enlarged powers for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I stated that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for UK resident workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning their home has become too distant, and the shame of those who sleep in bed is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the northeastern club, currently third in the Premier League, at three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalization," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if you are successful in managing clubs.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he didn’t feel afraid to follow up on such well-established names at such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, for now, success is all about ‘can I take the club back to the Premier League?’”
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, their place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I achieved that goal."
Ross's coaching career is only three years old, after a period as Dumbarton's deputy coach and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking care of the Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more as a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because it went well, I earned my life as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressures of the position, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Catering groups saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant occupancy declined 4.8%, the statistics show.
CGA consultant Peter Martin, who compiled the statistics, said: “The continuation of the good weather and England’s career in the longer-than-expected World Cup resulted in the June pattern, in which pubs recorded a 2.8% increase in sales, repeating itself in July, but the restaurants have seen an increase in sales.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage-based business had by far the best performance, with a peer-to-peer growth that more than offset the downturn in restaurants.
The pubs with the meal-based business also experienced difficulties, though not as dramatic as those of the catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed directly, beverage sales rose 6.6% throughout the month, with meals falling 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and catering analyst, said: “These results prolong the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing out-of-home food market sales.
It is no surprise that catering groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially damaging when added to prolonged cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only weather will tell if the mildest temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief."
The growth in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of the sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, being recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in Five Children Hide Secret Social Media Accounts From Parents
One in five children — some just 11 years old — have secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, a study reveals.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of "false" pages on Instagram
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children – some just 11 years old – creates accounts on social networks that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “false” accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a harmless "main" account to show their parents, while simultaneously having private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found that the teenager was inciting others to “rape her.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC), revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected Non-Executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the Regulator's Annual General Assembly.
President Ian Beattie described the nomination as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain from its presence on the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and I look forward to truly contributing to helping steer the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, has stopped being able to walk after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
He tweeted: “It’s been a month since I had a stroke.
I can no longer walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if he could recover and to what extent.
It has been a painful job but I have achieved a total recovery, I have re-learned to walk and I even do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!”
Advertisement of milk extraction pump compares mothers to cows, sharing opinions online
A dairy pump company shared opinions online with an ad that compares mothers breastfeeding cows in the ordnance.
To mark the launch of what is described as the “first portable silent milk extraction pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic ad inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom the new pump gives mothers who extract milk.
Four moms dance in a hay-filled cowboy's booty to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm sorting myself out, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The saying goes, "Bomb, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the ad posted on the company’s Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it alleviates the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
“It is a sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born.”
The Elvie extraction pump fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise an extraction pump for mothers who can stay with their babies?”
Someone else said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
“I think the idea is brilliant.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy but it makes all the sense.
This product is great,” one of the women wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like ‘cows.’
It’s not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women who extract milk with pumps claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, grab their babies and even leave the house while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between the women who extract milk and the dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible feeling of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was headlined.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the walkway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children peaked, although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most of the "parents" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing compromising their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults who are part of their households would have to register their fingerprints, the data being shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal background.
“Almost 80% of the godparents or members of their families are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month from the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, according to staff at the reception centers.
Many are present by videoconferencing, and not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to reception center officials and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the large size contributes to children’s signs of disruption being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends exacerbates the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria Calls for Immediate Withdrawal of US, French and Turkish Occupation Forces
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, a war that has left millions displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to “stop this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led the refugees to stay abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in Idlib’s last major rebel bastion has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement established "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists, including fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the challenge and scandals end his presidency early.
In the one that would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the spectators.
Since 2014, audiences at nobility have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at a high time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the cable audience with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“This is a strong whim for people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He once called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion of immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it’s more than just being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of an expert debate on Bob Woodward’s use of “deeply knowledgeable” sources in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather blouse (“a piece of clothing full of insolence....
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s dynamic cast and the daily twists of the story.
We can't lose an episode or we're behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He didn’t break away from television as Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Significant external funding in the interim elections for the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th Circle has seen an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of electoral circles that left two headliners in the race for the same spot.
The recent realignment of Pittsburgh suburban circles put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old circles favored Republicans unconstitutionally.
The race for the 17th round sparked a fierce dispute over funding the campaign between the financial arms of major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely contested March extraordinary elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional constituency.
That seat was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating.
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a heated meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until members kicked the Trump Organization out of management.
State Department officials have decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of the internal meetings, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to go ahead, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three American representatives returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations under anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study the History
The next bomb to be dropped could be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, about which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller is allegedly directing his investigation to ascertain whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, while preparing to run for office again and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of possibilities, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s downfall is inevitable – not even the one of his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
Americans are currently facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating about his inability to perform the position.
Rosenstein says The Times news is wrong.
“How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we dodge these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she told me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With a legacy like this, how could he not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game with Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season to the two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
"It was a point well earned by us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We played the game with a positive mindset and we scored a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end but, in global terms, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can score all three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year has been very tough, with all my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success.”
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform account
Despite the fact that the survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they intend to receive, few people have talked to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they’re not having that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t let them know your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choices for continuing care funding may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover those expenses, or financing using your own savings, as long as you have these values available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney by choosing a person of your trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the constitution of a proxy on your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan.”
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure when he returned home after a night in the city.
The victim, at the age of forty, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries do not involve a risk of death and the police have requested witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications interrupted, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that extends along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with lower administrative status than a province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Seismic Fire, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people died buried under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son detained on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been detained on charges of aggression.
Palin, 29, a resident of Wasilla, Alaska, has been detained on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su’s pre-trial detention center, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, meaning he could be sentenced to up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a gun under the influence of alcohol, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations for associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the region of Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York
The New York Public Prosecutor's Office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, crashing into pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and inflicted "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the requesting notification, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges may be punishable by the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight homicide charges in the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “considerable planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed him as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the relatives and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For a decade, the South Zone of New York hasn't asked for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the sentence was changed to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the accusers not to apply for the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest in the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while one of May's MPs suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Backward Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would "already have left" if Farage was Brexit minister.
But the challenge faced by May to reconcile her deeply divided fellow believers was underlined by the conservatives advocating the stay, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has debated to maintain her commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, permanence advocates and the EU.
Allies insist that she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan".
Bone suggested that responsibilities should have been assigned to Farage in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Strengthening his opposition to the EU, he declared: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone denied the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to remain is totally unfit.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration, saying to journalists: “I’m simply saying, Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: “Only prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians should “feel the pressure” if they are prepared to betray the decision to leave the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want to put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing United Kingdom.”
Advocates for the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists clashed with the “Conservatives Against Brexit” message after the group’s launch this weekend.
Workers’ Representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security issues they faced with a party application at the opening of Congress.
“It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for ‘Canada more’, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren Plans to "Seriously Consider" Possible Presidential Nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican MP Geoff Diehl, co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he may face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a debate since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time “for women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrest in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU Tigers
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims took a shot in the head, following which he eventually passed away," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted his presence at the scene, holding a gun, acknowledging he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
The Sims, a 1.98-meter junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was tied for 10 times last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind in defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and caused Hamilton to face traffic from the end of the peloton, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes went to the boxes a lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton surpassed him after a reluctant scramble, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tires too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up boxing in the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and he was a real gentleman, letting me outrun him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Poor body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because of her insistence that she would not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “worse, malicious, and false.”
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, look at how bad, malicious and fake people are,” Trump said.
“When we see the leaks and the communications and when they say ‘oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you run away?
Do you remember her response-- did you release the document? - 'Oh, what, what?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me.'
Well, wait a minute.
The flight left us... No, it wasn’t us,” she added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the leak occurred in early September, but denied that the leak had left his office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know what else, that was bad body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested Democrats would use the charges in his favor.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see evil, malice, it doesn’t matter who can hit, who has to step in to take power and control,” the president said.
First Division: Dundee Stars beat the Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from Friday's defeat in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand by 5-3 on Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants got an initial two-goal lead with finishes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald ensured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had managed a turnaround on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frantic first period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the draw to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants reached the first lead break, scoring their second night's goal at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second half, ensuring the team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, will receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to help hundreds of passengers flee earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after he died by ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post as the control tower collapsed violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower, in the face of the eminent collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
However, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, saying the country’s disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
“The balance sheet is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Lack of drinking water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces on site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that there is a man missing after plane crashes in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after communicating that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had been unable to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The area company claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical record.
It is not yet known for certain what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and docked in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had left the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming very low.
“It was the best thing that happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to crawl with water through their waistlines and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the on-board assistants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a nearby wetland improvement work also helped in the rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstitute the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quinto Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been to the city on that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis erased Chambers’s text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin filing its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed says hip hop has diverted from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York maid sues couple for firing via 'racist' text message
A New York midwife is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denied the allegations of racism, saying the trial was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some fear when she found out that the new mistress Giselle Maurice was black when she introduced herself for her first day at work in 2016.
"I can't believe ... MORE A BLACK," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she became aware of her gaffe, a "pregnant" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice alleging the poor performance of the previous African-American babysitter and that she was waiting for a Filipino babysitter.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day job and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and seeking a $350/day dismissal compensation for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
"I want to show you that you can't go unpunished," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical since they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t really mean.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would your children entrust anyone who had mistreated them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
Appealing the "extortion" process, Plasco said his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Will you chase someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
As the legal process proceeds, the public opinion court was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s so fun to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful.”
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little bear playing to write the children's book, would not have taken to heart if the book had been rejected, and added that the publication's 60th anniversary had a bittersweet taste given his passing last year.
About Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to gabarolice," he said.
But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we are proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my phone
Shortly after landing, the daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad would often call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“So Nad called and said that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
He said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that the doctors had given him to keep the heart working were slowly stopping and coming out of his system.
He had been dead for some time and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stop myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other foreign passengers to test what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I always laughed with my head down.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women post cards on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to have to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Sharon Davis, a 45-year-old resident of Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it was lighting up the room.”
However, he quit work before he died because he had “dipped into the darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible repercussion."
Sharon Davis created the postcards “to let them know that there are people who are available to help and who they can talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't shut yourself up, you have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after the death of her mother-in-law.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, there was a rag. When the kids opened the gifts, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it’s something they have to overcome: “Break up a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we must all continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake with the beginning of the FBI investigation
"I thought that by having the likes of what I asked for - an investigation with a defined time and scope - we could be more united," Flake said on Saturday, advancing that he feared the commission was "disintegrating" in the face of a rooted partisan impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is a mere temporary issue.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have poor results, they will see their attempts to elect their Supreme Court candidate frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI presents your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of defectors declines during Kim’s regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1,127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said more stringent border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers were asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public statement.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul has reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants and non-refugees, and it is frequent to repatriate them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss denuclearisation negotiations that are at a standstill.
The talks came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate on the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to be the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority in the House, said Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all legacies of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a stroking and solving voice, when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly accused the committee’s Democrats, calling the allegations made against him “a murder of a grotesque and conspiratorial character” organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves he has no qualifications to serve in the Supreme Court given his biased behavior against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
When asked whether he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's effective appointment and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don’t meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared Kavanaugh's potential views against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs. Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh outlined questions about the possibility of revoking certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and biased to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision,” Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control their emotions.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and it cannot escape without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something strange, do you?"
A woman with an executive position in any company helped me immensely. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but had created a technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it went on.
And I thought to myself... it’s brilliant,” continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly, in an old job in a man-dominated office where I was crying with unspeakable anger, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman — an unfriendly manager who terrified me a little — and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say,
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have been able to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democratic congresswoman, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and resigned from the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who dubbed the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, the fundraising was below the desirable and he swore he would only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When she announced that she was not going to go into a formal campaign, emotions came from above — gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and getting the message to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism — and tears came up.
“It even seemed like she was depressed,” Patricia Schroeder recalled as she spoke of the media’s reaction.
“I would have thought that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What are you going to write on my epitaph now?
"She cried?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
The first rescue from the trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening, and while the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of experts, the departure of the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week saw a significant aggravation of the situation with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), charging in reality half of all goods shipped by China to the US.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will hesitate in the near future.
Giving Washington back would mean succumbing to demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its triumphs, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In reality, the fact that a timely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate investigator dedicated to the Asia study at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready for Refugee Return
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is once again victorious after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn hit the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during nearly the entire tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter in what may have been his last participation in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the most award-winning European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t stop myself.
It's been a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said after Europe’s victory.
Pass the word to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated American golf legend, Tiger Woods, by 2&1 in singulares on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the remaining U.S. Selection members struggled to get to the fairway.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear into Europe.
Let's fight.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and I will collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
