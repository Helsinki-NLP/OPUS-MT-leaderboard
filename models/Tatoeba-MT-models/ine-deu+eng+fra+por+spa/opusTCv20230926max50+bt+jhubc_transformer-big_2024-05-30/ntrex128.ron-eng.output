Members of the Welsh National Assembly are concerned that they might give the impression that they are “puppets”
Several members of the Welsh National Assembly are dismayed that they were suggested to change their title, namely to be called MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the Assembly within the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Welsh National Assembly present on the political stage fear this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party within the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he is "remaining with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Welsh Party within the National Assembly of Wales said that, overall, the group "is not delighted" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said the group has an "open" attitude towards the name change, but that it also noted that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales in the same way as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the change of name, said: “The final decision on how members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on those members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them wish to use the ‘Parliament of Wales’.
With regard to the title of members of the National Assembly in Wales, the Commission preferred ‘Wales Parliament members’ or ‘WMP’, but the ‘MWP’ option received the most votes in the public consultation.
It appears that members of the Welsh National Assembly have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give Elin Jones, the chairman of the governing committee, who is expected to send the bill on changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly shall have the last word as to their title when the law is discussed.
Macedonians vote on referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion about changing their country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, the neighboring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider this vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is just a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of the Episcopal Church of St. Martin have stopped ringing as a result of the problems faced by the churches in Harlem
“Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you found a bar and a church at every corner of the street,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no more bars or churches.”
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently these days,” he said.
“Bars no longer serve as the living room for the whole neighborhood, where people usually gather.”
And as for churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expect and that, “sooner or later, the disclosure will be the same.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who will not support the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “as a result, this will accelerate the closure of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African Americans – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist congregation, made up of white people, moved from the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, who were carrying out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The St. Martin Church was taken over by a congregation of African-Americans, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that opposed hiring or promoting African-Americans.
A fire that occurred in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's enories made plans to rebuild it and included carillon in them.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to the Church of St. Martin, called the carillon “the bells of the poor people.”
The expert who commissioned Carillon in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said he was the first carillon in the world to be performed by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, which has included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the bishopric.
The sacristy, the governing entity of the diocese, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese would "seek to pass the costs" to the sacristy, even if it was not involved in the employment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the enorites complained about the lack of transparency that the diocese showed.
A Shark Injured a 13-Year-Old Child Trying to Catch Lobsters in California
Authorities said on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while he was swimming, trying to catch lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the San Diego-based KSWB-TV station that he had been swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a little boy crying for help and then moved along with a group that helped him out.
Hammel also said he initially thought the boy was thrilled to catch a lobster, but then realized he was yelling, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicle was torn, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
“I shouted to all those in the water and told them to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper trunk.
Authorities have restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons .
Giles also noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury plans to strengthen its position in the beauty and fashion products market in the UK
Sainsbury acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing beauty products in the style of a universal store with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion strengthening of the UK beauty products market, which continues to grow, although sales of household and fashion products are not on track, the larger areas with beauty products will be tested in more than one year, and will be integrated into 11 stores in the country.
The investment in the beauty industry comes in a context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Representatives of the retailer Sainsbury said that the number of beauty products it offers will double, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most of the products are intended for vegans, an increasingly popular demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain for testing, the first being the one opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury’s retailer, said outlets will increasingly look like universal stores as supermarket chains try to cope with the big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury has included products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores as well as Habitats since purchasing both chains two years ago, which means that it has seen increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty products compartments has failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ended after a disagreement over how Boots's store revenues were split into its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury’s retailer, said: “We have transformed the look of our areas with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to give you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle contract with his company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of the show, This Morning, announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby sparked the rage of Peter Jones, the star of the show Dragons’ Den, pulling at the last minute from their lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones got angry when one of the most beloved people on television admitted on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5million, no longer allow them to dedicate themselves to them.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have almost doubled Willoughby's fortune by an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would quit his contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It was going to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to resign shocked everyone.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, it was a little while before the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at the Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe the withdrawal of “This Morning” host, one of Britain’s best-selling celebrities, could hurt the company by millions as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible further delay in launching.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as CEO in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very tough, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes about the criticism he would get from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider “unworthy of a president” and about the fact that he has such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step backwards?
Trump said he imitated a voice as a “news presenter.”
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have ended.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not observed a “correct response” from the United States to the North’s delay in taking action.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on our way to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the US military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to behave like a president, but if I were to behave like that, instead of the 10,000 people out there trying to get into this reckless arena, there would be around 200 people," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a necessary condition for triggering aid actions internationally.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known if foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to the relief efforts.
Given the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly suffering, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for the rage of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not found very often on other shores.
It appears that the absence of a warning siren in the event of a tsunami in Palu, although a warning has been issued in this regard, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even in the best of circumstances, traveling between islands in Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters make this even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the place where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo has proposed that the improvement of Indonesia’s precarious infrastructure be at the heart of his election campaign and has eagerly allocated money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko’s administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from sects in Indonesia as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the save goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge football stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 meters from the opponent's goal, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before kicking in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached above the dock, heading towards the upper right corner of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to move forward as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and that was enough, I didn’t think much about it, I just took the ball further.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The striker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then turned into the middle of the field and ran to the half of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who entered the queue.
Hazard overcame the defense and sent the ball into the net, succeeding in hitting it with his left foot and passing Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami reached 832 on Sunday morning, according to the national disaster agency.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that took place Friday and triggered waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000 people, was covered by the debris caused by the collapse of the buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Killing Woman by Knife
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything on the subject to come to the police station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to all people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to request everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful materials using the on-board camera to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, several people came to the scene of the crime who believe they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police said they were trying to inform the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few hours before they were allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered the scene of the crime.
On the spot, a woman appeared in tears.
He keeps saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the perimeter and another was outside.
Several police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to the police <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the most recent memorial monument affected by the altercations on the "rewriting of history"
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its puritan fanatic descendants.
Cromwell described Jeremy Crick’s suggestion as “a madness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his forefather Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation or not, this is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But surely the conflict of the mid-17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure who is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A pig killed a farmer in China.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was cut and covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to Sunday's South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It appears that he had come with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighboring cottage was open.
He said that in the cot was a large male pig with blood in the mouth.
Forensic doctors confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the farmer’s death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were full of blood and lacerated," his cousin, whose family name is Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man’s death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the pig was shut down to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence from the scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have also been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a Welsh man was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them due respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing intensity as it moves to the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressive zone has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the intense tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressive zone will generate abundant rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, precipitation between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm is expected in the southwestern part, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to the conditions of rapid deterioration due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is not advisable to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rains could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into bursts and dust.
The approaching depression zone will bring torrential rainfall to areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of almost 2 cm is possible, which could cause minor flows of waste and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second half of Sunday and the first part of Monday, before the rain spreads further on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Intense rainfall will spread to the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature changes in the U.S. as the Arctic region gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered at the level of the central area of the US.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to face a warm October start, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the southern plains to certain parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people followed the press statement backed by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting Friday’s normal program for a state-of-the-art news: an agreement reached between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the jury that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had harassed her while he was drunk and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was watched by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters were yelling at him and he was trying to get into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He looked down for a few minutes as people argued with him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
She was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed, he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television later broadcast the vote live within the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he will only do so if the FBI agrees to look into the charges against the nominee next week, as demanded by minority democrats.
Flake was largely convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards.
Flake's election was an important one, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of 'political games' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political games” with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to the front-page photo, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on her Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect each other's tariffs was ridiculous.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released the footage of the confrontation between the Sims and the Simpsons, and police said the Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
Following Simpson's interrogation, police say he confessed to having shot Wayde deadly.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Bureau of Forensic Medicine released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana police force, the forensic lab of the state police, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for the help provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for “diligence and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m tall striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is something that worries me all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano Throws Ash Column Over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to keep their distance from the volcano after activity in the crater was triggered and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several hurricanes and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano 72 km southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Catalonia police and separatists clash before independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote, gathering thousands of opposing protesters.
A group of masked pro-separatists held away by gendarmes bombed them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The imprisonment intensified later, with police using their sticks to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while union protesters shouted “Long live Spain!”.
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose, by an overwhelming majority, to become independent, although voter turnout was low, and those against secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, with violent clashes taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I had some of the best moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry for joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing more to do," he said.
Despite achieving a vital but tight victory in the regional elections in December last year, pro-independent Catalan parties tried to maintain the momentum this year, many of the best-known leaders being either in their own exile or in detention, awaiting the verdict for the role they had in the organization.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“As a candidate in the European elections it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several Men Arrested After Entering a House by Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly entered a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place Thursday, at about 19:30, in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage to the gates and even the building was caused.
Apparently, at some point, an arbalète was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped Livingston win 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers unchallenged, with Steven Gerrard reaching his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard’s team runs out of a Premier League win this season and faces the Hearts leaders with eight points behind them on Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division for up to six games, Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Is Missing Its Opportunity Against Crude Visitors
Holt's team was supposed to move forward long before they scored, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to jump into the space of the gate, then Alan Lithgow managed to jump wide after sliding in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause visitors trouble on free kicks.
And that’s how the crucial gap came.
The Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to care about Menga, who kicked and scored from the center of the car.
At that stage, the Rangers dominated the possession, but faced the host's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was no longer at sea disturbed for the rest of the game.
This pattern of play continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Allan McGregor of the Rangers, and Lithgow gave a wide kick from another Livingston player.
The diagonal passes continued to come in which the Livingston team, but unsuccessfully, and the two requests for penalties - after Halkett beat Glenn Middleton and after a hit - were not accepted.
"Fenomenal game" offered by Livingston – review
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an ascending trajectory.
Their playing style and team have not changed at all since returning to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he has coached his team since he took over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren't very inspired.
Although they have had good performances since they were led by Gerrard, they did not reach the same standards.
The goal lanes were unsuccessful, they managed only once to catch the goal of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin to have breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied with issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside of Turkey.
Police invoked security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, mostly Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him with open arms in the country.
The protests contradictoryly reflect the division over a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a car
A cyclist died after colliding with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist died in an accident on Childers Street, in which the driver fled from the scene, which is about a mile from where the accident occurred on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the bus route is deviated, and motorcyclists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in clash
Six prison officers were injured in a clash at a high-security men's prison, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a clash broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m., and it was underway.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the fighting, involving eight detainees, isolated in a wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: “The prison’s specialised personnel have been requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were wounded.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and may spend a longer period of time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a detainee.
And last year, in October, riot officers were summoned to prison to deal with a very serious situation, staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are at risk of being flooded due to Hurricane Rosa (dry areas may enjoy benefits as a result)
There is rarely a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued high-speed flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of Monday it will cause precipitation.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix announced in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression state at a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane operating at a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the desert in the southwest, including in the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, there will be recorded quantities between 3 and 5 cm, with total quantities possible up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions beyond the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas torrential rain will be beneficial as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing a drought that is at least severe, the second largest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which still had hurricane power on Sunday morning with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and, therefore, will decrease.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, with a high risk of flooding.
“Tormential rainfall is expected between 8 and 10 cm” from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and can reach as much as 25 cm, according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger the lives of people, and bring waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The officers asked for the help of citizens who could have materials on the mobile phone, respectively, to present themselves to the police station.
Trump says Kavanaugh faced “discontent and anger” from Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh faced “discontent and anger” from the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims about sexually harassing her ten years ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified in the hearing about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw that day the genius, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not running, but in a way, I’m running,” he said.
“For this reason, I express my positive opinion everywhere about the candidates that I consider to be amazing.”
Trump said Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake in Indonesia, the number is increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves that hit beaches, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when waves of six meters high struck the beach at dusk, people being taken by the waters and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still seeing their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference.
"The tsunami brought with it cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people were forced to climb trees to get rid of the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency show several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the protests continued to shake the city on the coast.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy emitted by the strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb of World War II.
The geographic structure of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, has probably intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, the representative added.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were "completely disrupted, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for failing to report that a tsunami would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In social media posts, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building shouting frenetic warnings that the tsunami is approaching the people on the adjacent street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate authorities' rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending aid-laden cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basics.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the Palu evacuation centers for Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the town of Palu, where employees are housed in improvised shelters in the office yard, they passed devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Although relief groups have begun to initiate disaster relief actions, some people have complained that foreign workers with extensive expertise have been prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, materials delivery and personnel can only reach the place of production of a calamity if it is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia, said in a statement.
“After the government will say, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid actions, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday in Palu, the friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding drivers.
Other captives at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to competitors in Palu who took part in the beach festival.
But in the right of his messages appeared only one gray steak, and not two blue steaks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t transmitted,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "runned through the back of the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money to be carried.
According to the statement, witnesses noticed several suspects who fled the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West Changes Stage Name to ‘Ye’
Kanye West changed his stage name to "Ye".
He made the announcement about the change on Twitter on Saturday: “the individual officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled "for reasons of an emotional nature," the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation for the current stage name, West previously stated that this word also has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, as he discussed the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m new, it’s about us.
It all started with “Kanye,” which means the one, and came to “Ye,” which is a reflection of our good, bad, unclear things, and the whole.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are as people.”
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with a pot, sometimes without, as well as in capital letters.
Mexico's president vows not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military forces against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that “he will never use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the marketplace on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when student leftist movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and by opening several free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be at the forefront of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and that we are looking for the next AI discovery,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the odds that the next big achievement in AI will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the American player Othello, being the best in the field at the time, and later served as executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated previous U.S. government competitions in technology, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that puts sticks in the wheels of academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. intensify its AI efforts.
“I think we should automatically give a visa to doctoral students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides financial support to individuals in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called “AI Next.”
Also at this time, the NSF is investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there have been no changes to U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a change that would settle a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the neighboring country represents a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about attendance at the vote, being possible not to reach the minimum 50% threshold required to validate the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: “Are you in agreement with joining the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few Members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum in parliament is required.
The state’s electoral commission said no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of people with the right to vote went to the polls.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje, the country’s capital.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on changing Macedonia’s name, which will allow them to join NATO and join the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of the tents raised by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them up front, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted in the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the majority will be in favor of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of joining NATO and the EU,” Zaev said after expressing his vote.
He said a result in favor of the name change would be “confirming our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favor of the change.
For the referendum to be valid, attendance at the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since the government took over in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to pass the entire defensive team of Brighton and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the defensive side of Brighton and win Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly between three defensive players from Brighton before reaching the free side of the field.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender, and then overcame several warning players at the edge of that Brighton team.
After that, he gave a pass to the left, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English forward sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, managing to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, with a kick to the right of the goal.
"Aguero is facing some problems on his feet," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for the Azuri in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero scored an in-depth pass on the territory of the Brighton team at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a pass on the left flank.
Sane dribbled the ball a few times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the gate.
The Azuri striker hit the ball towards the net just before heading off the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc against the Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still play-off implications for the Rockies, who hold an advantage with a game-faced Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have secured at least one unpredictable seat with a 5-2 victory over the national team on Friday night, but are still trying to keep their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these circumstances?”
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the match on Sunday, but according to the sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening shot of the match with number 34, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw under normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 losses in 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding the Supreme Court’s decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
There are still five weeks left until one of the most important choices in our lives.
“This is one of the big ones, I’m not running, but I’m actually running, so I’m trying hard to support good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrific, radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, you can see their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control, that’s what they want, have power and control, and we’re not going to give it.”
He also said that the democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
"And you can see that in the last four days," he said, describing Democrats as "furious and evil, vicious and liars."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has been strongly dismissed by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you divulge the document?
What? What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different point of view.
People who express their opinions are no longer tolerated.
I was not surprised at all that Momentum activists from my local party supported the censorship motion as far as I was concerned.
After all, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehemently anti-Semitic.
As far as I am concerned, the motion of censure was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, on which even Jeremy had no common views with previous leaders.
The Communication for Friday’s meeting in Nottingham East of the Labour Party stated that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight-year term as a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party, Friday evening’s GC meetings were as follows.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not take place in this way, and the promise of a "better, gentler" political environment has long been forgotten, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things started to be like this when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision of politics began to expect me to change my mind and agree with some things I would not agree with before, including national security or the single market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuses on the desocialization networks that demand my removal from the party, denouncing the center policy, telling me I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my colleagues because comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination shown by my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censure or change of selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible in this regard.
Many people have advised me in the last two years to put my head down, to stop being so vocal, and everything “will be fine” like that.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence of the Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as a minister or local councilor.
I never hid my political views, including in the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues with which I disagree with the current leadership are unclear.
To the people who supported Friday’s motion, I can only say that, as the country moves toward Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not to the Momentum group in Nottingham, but to the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise that no threat of removal from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions that I consider to be your superior interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's extremely interactive match in Tennent's Premiership.
He is now at the top of the rankings, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Eventually, it all boiled down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more advantage of the opportunities that appeared, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
“We’ve been tested several times over the course of our matches so far and we continue to be unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “The merits are given to Ayr team, they took advantage of the chances more than us.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave the Ayr team an advantage, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing at the Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to take advantage of a failed attempt to change the score.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the match, managed to score, and then managed to transform an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes due to Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, which was pulled off the pitch with a plate, and since the game's resumption, Ayr unleashed through the attempt of Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an unprocessed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a terrible pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for playing Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving him the Ayr team advantage.
Climo transformed the attempt, as he did again close to the restart of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a box-kick move and sent the extreme Gregor Henry into the depths for the fifth attempt of the host team.
The star of the sitcom "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom "Still Game", seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's beloved show, writing the script and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the number nine, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, though a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in the “restaurant development industry.”
"The sea is ours": Bolivian island hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a crane-filled naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings bear the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
We have to get her back."
Along Bolivia, which has no seafaring, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive – just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s decision on the big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial fight for next year’s re-election – also has much to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too few things would change if it happened.
The United Nations body within the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory that belongs to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision comes just six months after the final pleadings were heard indicates that this case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only has Bolivia been unsuccessful, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of mutually advantageous disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – was using the maritime issue as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place if the United States cannot be trusted
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come in a context where U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an “unrealistic dream” that the ongoing sanctions and the U.S.’s objection to the end of the Korean war would ever make the territory in the north give up.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Pyongyang has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you’re looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t have to look any further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked attendees at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
Unpractical hats conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion creators have sent eye-catching creations to the podium.
The endurance piece of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant beige hat, with a wide, feather-like bore, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included pearl-decorated melons, a wizard’s hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and not the haute couture fashion.
One of the creations appeared to be a diving gear, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other appeared to be a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a clothing style, with oversized clothing items, you are lucky.
Stylists anticipate a return of huge hats in luxury fashion stores.
Oversized hats come back after the appearance of the "La Bomba" hat, the straw hat with a wide bore, seen by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the unpractical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the emergence of another oversized creation on the podium, namely the beach straw bag, with a size as large as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The raffle orange bag, with raffle fringes and a white leather handle, was the endurance piece of Jacquemus’ Spring-Summer 2019 “La Riviera” collection at Paris Fashion Week
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer because the fashion designer has had such a powerful impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills, Essential for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record for academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for high school and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are among the top rankings, with the highest promotion rates within independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a subject, are held the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills because of the reasons employers gave for the fight for job vacancies.
Therefore, increasingly, language skills are becoming imperative for preparing young people for their future careers.
With multiple job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That’s why investing in learning foreign languages is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will be more likely to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be more languages of choice within independent schools, with teachers who specialize in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done (it has to be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James making his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play remains to be settled.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited time.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare," he said.
Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallyes tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled next week, which include stops in places where the electorate is in favour of him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his nominee for the vacancy in the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s election rally in West Virginia take place tonight and where can I watch him online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 East Coast time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, a hearing that has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate’s awaited confirmation vote is suspended for a week for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some ground.
Trump’s campaign said the role of these five rallies next week was “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the highly crowded campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, the rally tonight could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won the election with a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is led in polls.
“The fact that the president came to try to propel him into polls is not a good sign for Morrisey,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Determination and Continues to Fight to Maintain Chance for Simple Trials Starting Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it’s possible that Saturday afternoon’s foursome was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
"They led us by six points, now the difference is only four points, so we're relying on this drop for a little motivation," Spieth said.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still twelve points in play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is beginning to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons to encourage, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and won three out of four points each.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with lethal accuracy, being an example to his colleagues.
Those cheerful festivities became louder as he advanced, especially when he scored a crucial point by which he regained the score in the fourth game, after he and Thomas had been driven by two points after the first two holes.
The shot by which he won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar yelling, a yelling that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth says.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but adorable couple has won four out of four games and it seems they can’t fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't need any extra blows on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid for both Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and even for the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the opinion that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would bring to an end a potential victory over the Nationals when they win.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
Talks about the glory of Europeans remain premature, for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs rehearsal, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The fourballs and foursome samples are fascinating and worth watching closely due to the interactions between pairs, the tips given and ungiven and the way a strategy can change on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 in Ryder Cup final day
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after finishing Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two wins in front of a hesitant Tiger Woods, raising their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, trying to regain the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American players who made many mistakes in the morning fourballs and won the series with a score of 3 to 1.
The U.S. opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two games, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points out of 12 Sunday simple games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points out of four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they supported themselves superbly to defeat discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score of 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two games on Saturday, occasionally had sparks of genius, but so far has lost 19 of the 29 games to fourballs and foursomes, seven of which were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome rehearsal and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1, positions one and three in the world.
Europe, however, did not have an unimpeded route on this pleasant and cool day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2–1 match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes after losing their first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in simple rehearsals, although because they are the current trophy holders, Furyk's players only need an equal score.
However, after being in second place for two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extending sanctions would deepen distrust of the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the global council that North Korea had implemented “significant measures to prove its good faith” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear tests and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site, and the commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and weapons non-proliferation.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t trust our national security capabilities and, in such circumstances, we can’t disarm unilaterally first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar objections to Washington's opposition to a "scalar" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant because he did not directly reject the past unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump as part of a first-ever summit between a U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress towards a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered the North’s guarantees.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not responded to demands to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States insists on the option of ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, even objecting to the ‘declaration of an end to war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can kneel is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: "If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even in these conditions, Ri’s tone of speech was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with missiles from North Korea after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with “total destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to initiate the disarmament process, but said work was just beginning and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this, adding: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have very good results.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but after just a few hours, North Korea denounced him as having made “gangster threats.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and that he wanted normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes on how to get enough rest
A new course from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep longer in an attempt to combat the growing “macho” culture that makes them undergo “all night” learning sessions energized with high levels of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that, often, students at the world’s most prestigious university don’t even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why is this only being told to me now, in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been talked about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course can involve a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the image of a living room is presented, and students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know we can’t instantly change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as everyone has the right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure placed on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain believe that the body is hungry, which makes students constantly feel that they are hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before enrolling in this institution where competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler advised students to schedule an alarm to know when it is time to go to bed, as well as for waking hours, and to know what are the damaging effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause difficulty in arming.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffer another case of depression on the move because Dolly Menga's hit condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to get their first on-the-go win since the 4–1 triumph against St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat out of 18 games as a coach, putting the Rangers eight points behind the Hearts, the leaders of the authoritarian Premier Bros.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers players didn’t seem to be able to equalize at any moment.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth place in the standings, while Livingston rose to third place behind Hibernian, with a single goal difference.
And the Rangers could face other problems as well, as torso referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the visitors' fan lawn.
Gerrard switched eight players from the batch that he easily won against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained batch suffocated his opponents during the match.
Even though the Rangers had a higher possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored just two minutes after the game began, when Menga's first pass pushed Scott Pittman to the defending goal by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
The Rangers took control, but gave the impression that they had more hope than confidence in their game in the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he clashed with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals on the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered at all by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak kick.
Although Livingstone's 34-minute goal did not respect the game's tendency, no one can deny that it was deserved, even for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent Jacobs’ deep centering.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed to Menga, who finished with a simple shot.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this move almost immediately yielded results when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the goals to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to exactly the same type of match he preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting centering after centering.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phases, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs's shot, then Lithgow headed next to the corner shot.
Glenn Middleton, a reserve at the Rangers, called for a penalty at the end of the game, when he hit Jacobs, but again, Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday Morning Almanach: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the count CONTINUE...), is the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science ever since, the Geiger Counter has also become essential for pop culture, as happened in the film The Gloves of San Coronado (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the roles of cowboys with unlikely inclinations towards science:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Yeah, I hear a lot of knocks!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “Detect” Harmful Cells
A New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “Detect” Harmful Cells and Destroy Them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can “detect” a protein common to many cancers and are then re-injected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab so that they can “detect” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and “teach” them to target cancer cells, has also worked for treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a supportive diatribe of Trump while wearing a MAGA hat after appearing at SNL.
It didn't go out too well
Kanye West was huddled in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a flattering show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he plans to run for the 2020 election.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist unleashes himself in a speech against Democrats and reaffirms his support for Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?
Well, if I had been concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, West's diatribe footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take over West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems behind the scenes because of his cheek.
“They tried to intimidate me behind the scenes.
They told me, “Don’t go out wearing this hat.”
I've been assaulted!
They also told me that we got very low,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how low I've gotten?" and then said, "I'm going to grab my Superman cloak, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try it with love.”
His comments have attracted public dismay at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one person from this team told the publication: "In the studio there was a complete silence."
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits of us: THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, tweeted that West simply “was himself and that’s great.”
“But I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think embraces and expresses an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now “the being officially known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, previously known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the "artist formerly known as Prince".
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbed in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear Monday before the Belfast Court.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Kit Harington, the star of Urzuela de los Tronos, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series The Hurt of the Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that the screening of these roles makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt that "something went wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old Throne Harvest colleague Rose Leslie, has admitted he is "very determined" to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about it now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What have we taught men about how to be like adults, given the problem we are facing now?”
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do young boys learn from TV and on the street, what makes them think that there must be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
It is clear that something has happened to the young people.”
In the interview, he admitted that he will not play in any series based on The Urzuela of the Thrones after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that "he's done with the battlefields and the horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new production of Sam Shepard's True West play, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that has happened to him because of the series Urzuela de los Tronos is that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I made this show, so it assured me of my family’s future and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widely considered.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee disclosed the data of Republican senators, talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were made by analysts and “extreme right” websites.
“Lies, lies and other miserable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information disclosed included the senators' personal addresses and phone numbers: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Supreme Court judge.
The leak occurred shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and presented the information to a member of Waters’ team, Hill reported.
“These unfounded allegations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The team member, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.”
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
It is not necessary to question the motive of the accused.
It has to be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Justice Kavanaugh, criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
“Important, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be discovered,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable before the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Johnny English strikes again: flagless spy movie parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the parody series of action films that features Johnny English as the main character, the series which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will this throbbing satire of how strange we are become the nation’s new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with staring eyes and rubber face, has been renewed for the second time his license to spoil everything. The name of the character means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the film audience in English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the sneaky secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip from the guy who contributed a single note to the music theme of London's Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony of the Games.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious landless man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind him.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two cute moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor pallets gently hit his hood.
The gift that Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because “serious” movies, such as those in the 007 series or Mission Impossible, confidently offer comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to appeal more to children than to adults, and for me, Johnny English’s thrilling adventures aren’t as inventive and clever as Atkinson’s silent film gags when they play the role of Bean.
As always, the premise is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the UK’s top-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of undercover English agents, to the despair of the service agent, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a pompous and besieged prime minister who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with her character resembling Theresa May, but the script does not give her a chance to shine.
Her secret intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she needs to activate a backup agent.
This is Johnny English's own son-in-law, now working as a teacher in a high school, but also giving lessons on how to be a covert agent. Here are some cute guys, because English runs a School of Rock-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, then reunited with his former partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
So, these Batman and Robin of creating the mess in the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, confronting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of burlesque adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fashionable French restaurant, create chaos as they sneak aboard Volta’s luxury vessel, then English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use his home virtually for a real eyewear set.
This latest sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the film may be, it seems like a children's television production.
A rather mediocre film.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can’t stop wondering: Can the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
Labour denies plans for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would have a radical plan that the British would only work four days a week, but be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the heads of companies to take advantage of the possible savings due to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
Sources say the idea would “match” with the party’s economic program, which wants to tilt the balance in favor of workers.
The shift to the four-day working week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour leader told The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day week of work is an appropriate aspiration in the approach of the party to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the overall strategy of the party on industry.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party’s promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
The chancellor of the shadow cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profiteers” from utility companies.
The Lord Chancellor’s plans in the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water-supplying kings may not fully recover their shares, because the Labour government may be collecting “deductions” due to found crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to the boards of directors of companies and to create equity funds by which to assign 10% of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in “60 Minutes” whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh would make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded not to back him anymore because of FBI findings.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I have said this since the beginning of the hearings; I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the accusations came up, and I asked him, “Are you guilty?”
The answer was decided, promptly, unequivocally."
Graham’s vote, however, seems dug in stone.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so some explosive charges would be needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejects the allegations,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people named by her have confirmed the report.
And that happened 36 years ago.
I doubt that something will change.”
What is the Global Citizen’s Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen’s Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
Coming to the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people to Central Park lawn, not only to follow artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen’s Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending some emails to world leaders, making some phone calls or other significant things to remove them that help increase their degree.
But how successful was the Global Citizen’s Festival when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to get them to act, or is it just another case of so-called “cliktivism,” a concept that refers to people who feel they have accomplished something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, there have been more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, for which at least $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based global partnership of investors and intermediaries who have pledged to “help children grow to their full potential,” which has promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than $47 million.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the book of history,” said Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s 2018 ambassador, in front of many concerts.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights movements or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will sing at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use naval forces for a “blockade” that would make it harder for Russia’s energy exports, the Secretary of the Interior said.
Washington can, “if necessary,” resort to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argues that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason I’m in the Middle East is because I want to mediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
“The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade so that energy does not come to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself to be the “energy consumer’s voice” in the US.
He went on to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to use and replace fuels,” he said, saying about Russia that he “knows one trick” because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statement comes at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said the U.S.’s fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we look at things the same: energy cannot be a tool to put pressure on and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Aleksandr Novak, Russia’s energy minister, after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has urged the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third state intervening in our energy issues,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is “seriously thinking” about running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she needed to "think seriously" if she was to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, and that requires a strong woman,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to run for president.”
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the meeting at the city hall, saying that he “directed the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate he appointed to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “It’s normal that we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that Warren’s majority of voters don’t think they should run for office in 2020 either.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy of him and 48% are against.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress syndrome at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a case of domestic violence.
“The things my own son is going through, what he went through after he came back ... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the aftermath of the wounds our soldiers come back with,” Trump said.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "return a little different, harder, wondering if there is still respect for what they and their soldiers in the military and air forces, as well as all the other members of the army, have done for the Army".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing reporting an act of domestic violence and holding a drunk firearm, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae request Friday in Washington to support a policy challenge on asylum seekers, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and "his violent sons, members of a gang," abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The named state attorney representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing a widespread problem of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has overturned a 2014 Immigrant Appeals Council decision that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
“Federal law states that all applications for asylum must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” the amicus curiae petition states.
In addition, lawyers argue in the lawsuit that the policy of refusing immigration affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11, when he announced the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems that people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths has doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became worse.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforts her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient.”
The residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded possessions, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale, were overrun by the situation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered spine and shoulder fractures, are resting outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to strong and ongoing replicas.
He has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the five-story hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Abuse’ of ‘Propaganda Advertisements’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute propaganda materials.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 election for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election has marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war, involving waves of rising tariffs on imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were created to affect exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, experts from China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“When it disseminates propaganda by publishing an advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect America’s much-appreciated tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that this media is under the control of the Communist Party of China.”
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it is.
Republicans alienate female voters before midterm elections due to Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
With many of the top Republicans supporting and protecting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple sexual abuse allegations, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion created by this scandal has been extremely strong, and the majority of Republicans who have publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the furious electorate.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Come November!" as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But they could be even bigger, especially among the indecisive female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29, who, although they don’t agree with the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse brought to the nominee at the Supreme Court, analysts suggested there could be a backlash if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
“This has turned into a mess for Republicans,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just the vote in the committee or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh would be confirmed, it’s also about how the Republicans handled this situation and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an electoral support group of Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided as to what part they should believe according to Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimonies: a little more people seem to believe the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe it is likely that Ford’s testimony was true, while 35% said they strongly believe it or that Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
On Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford declared under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused her intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals in front of her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “global dominance.”
“Now we have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data archives” or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal consolidation through data”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute adequate resources, processes, and skills so that it makes Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don’t talk to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely overwhelmed at once.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The cleric who won the Victorian Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only Anglican church cleric to win a Victorian Cross medal as a World War I fighter was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honor in Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns."
Later, he hurried to reach the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked an artillery nest on his own and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to match, but that makes me feel humbled.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching Bellator 206, a multi-star event, just so you can’t watch the main event.
The program of the San Jose event contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were astonished when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed awake all night to watch the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to children’s cartoon as “a kind of bad joke.”
“Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"The Peppa Pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, they will schedule their events in such a way that they can be watched by viewers in the UK.
“When I think about reprises, I think we could probably fix it,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday day here and we won’t be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, I started to receive a lot of text messages and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to be five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We've tried to give the fans more and we've crossed the line.
It is an unhappy situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ to Sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he only realized when he got to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he was talking about the rights of gay people to give others “hope.”
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the traditional show, will be missing for a few months due to a disease.
Invited in Laverne's first edition, Daley said that when she was a child she felt "inferior" to others because "it was socially unacceptable for me to like boys and girls as well."
He said, “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different were the real things that gave me the strength and endurance to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and took advantage of appearing at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live freely, without a trace, and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple world champion said he was "surprised" by falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married the Oscar-winning filmmaker last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such an early age” – he attended the first Olympics when he was only 14, and his father died of cancer after three years – he said, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same good and bad moments.
The two became in June the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed his “whole perspective.”
“If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in nothing but winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are things more important than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they had received tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be the first.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘You won’t be able to be a father first,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and died did I finally accept that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew I had dreamed of this for a lifetime, jumping in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympics, there is no feeling more beautiful," he said.
This also inspired him in the chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, passed on the reserve bench on Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays in his forty-seventh Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get back in good shape so it won’t be an unfortunate opportunity.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on the reserve bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursome rehearsals.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the U.S. team, the five-time major-tournament winner split his day between being a cheerleader for teammates and practicing his punches, hoping to straighten out what he did wrong.
The 48-year-old player has never had the right drives, even at the best time of his career, so it’s not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish wrong kicks.
And if the field isn’t big enough, in Sunday’s ninth match Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion who teamed up with newcomers Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson’s match could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points on entering the 12 simple matches that must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player's ability, but he could not have said anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the shoulder, hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams last week and this week.
I had no idea he would play in two games.
I imagined more, but that’s what happened, and that’s how I thought we should do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not risen to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought intangible advantages to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes to joke with the players, he's a great guy in the team's locker room," he said.
“I think young players have fun joking with him, it was fun to see them doing this during the week.
His role is more important, it’s not just about the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the considerable advance could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but hardly managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remember we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” said Bjorn (pictured) after watching as the 2018 team, which won 5–3, and Le National on Friday and Le led.
“So history shows me and my team that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at maximum speed.
Let’s go out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not finished until the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We’ve always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we also know what’s waiting for us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the way his players dealt on a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Individual performance is important tomorrow, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the fullest as a golfer.
This is the message that you have to pass on to the players, that they have to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play better at the simple trial than they did with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing team when Europe succeeded in the "Miracle of Medina".
“I remember every word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
“We have 12 big games tomorrow and we would love to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those matches in the middle.
We have created our proper lot and ordered the players as we would like, you know, we’re trying to create a little magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“We chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers all the subjects,” Bjorn said of the lot for the simple trial.
Germany's new warship postponed again
Germany's newest naval frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace outdated Cold War war warships, but this will only happen next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The entry into service of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be introduced to the naval forces in 2014, but problems after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are supposed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vehicle missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which ensure a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for the new frigates to depart on missions lasting two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continued delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to increase Germany’s naval strength, will already be obsolete before they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The frigid F125 was discussed in the press last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a vessel to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available about the reasons for the refusal, but the media in Germany cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that would have made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the vessel was much too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate vessel is thought to be twice as heavy as the German vessels used in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, and the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, became a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), from the initial price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest frigates take on special importance given the latest warnings that Germany’s maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy “has begun to run out of vessels that can be sent on missions.”
The official said the problem has steadily increased over time as the old vessels were taken out of service without being replaced with new ones.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Württemberg class had entered service within the Navy.
The National Trust is spying on the secret lives of bats.
New research that is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how bats use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these unprecedented flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will analyze common dwarf bats and pigmeat bats, as well as ear bats and water bats from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
A specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
A map of the habitat and a report will be produced to create a detailed, scaled image of their behavior in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating lawn, and what is the best way to maintain forest meadows for bats and other associated species.
Flea populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by the construction and development work that affects their nests, but also by the loss of habitat.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are fly traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, control the nests and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bat species are found in Scotland.
The farm manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
“Here at Threave, the area is great for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply.”
It emphasizes the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance work on properties, as the simple unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chicks, which can destroy the entire local population.
Fleas are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the allegations against him are “fake news” and that some people “want to advertise” using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese striker and Juventus team have been accused of raping a woman identified as Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to mention the incident.
Hours after the allegations were published, in a Instagram Live video for his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said they were “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner in front of the video camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable report of suspicions of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for “moral damages equivalent to an adequate amount for the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was a "good boy" in the proportion of "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the accused, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims to have addressed the police and that the photos of her wounds were taken at the hospital, but she subsequently accepted an agreement outside the courtroom because she was "terrified by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that "it would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that deal because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused of, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘would forever regret’ loss of car manufacturers
Britain would "regret forever" if it lost its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "worrisome" that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s executive director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they feared leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford plant where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “fix on time” principle: for custom-built cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which, according to industrial manufacturers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than the inventory for a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production would be shut down.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future EU relations is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border delays.”
“There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best deal, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“Evidence from not only Toyota, but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue to use what has been a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that increased prices could reduce the factory’s long-term competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: “The experience has taught me that after they disappear, these jobs will never return.”
A government spokesman said: “We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the election, the links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors that Trump might fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, have been circulating in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which again postponed the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not yet been set a date in this regard. It may be this week or it may be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by the antipathy towards TV reporters, who like to be on the show, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to be on the show."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president participates in more question-and-answer sessions than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "We have analyzed the figures."
“There will be more briefings,” Sanders said, but “I think it’s much better for the press to have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, not me.
We’re trying to do this most of the time, and you might have noticed that we’ve done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the U.S. president will replace press briefings when it’s available.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, in bizarre places, in front of the gathered reporters.
A Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health addresses, in a letter, EU employees of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit-related concerns
The secretary of state wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of Parliament in Scotland, sent the letter as it was less than six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to bear the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations have continued, with decisions expected to be made this fall.
But the UK government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head
Tennessee State Tigers backer Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head on Saturday in a game his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31-27, Tennessee Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the cough line and he just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie had his oxygen mask put on by physical trainers and medical staff on the tow line before putting him on a tarpaulin and transporting him off the field for a detailed assessment.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had emerged from the operation he had undergone at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/amplitude of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a year 2 student, is in his first season in Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to score five goals in total before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 goals throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher legal stamp fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamped court fee when buying a property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help homeless people, according to new Conservative Party plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
The stamp court fee will be applied to non-taxable persons in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher rate of stamp duty when buying a property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May is due to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s successful efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising more affordable homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher stamped judicial fee will be applied to individuals and legal entities that are not paying taxes and taxes in the UK, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government’s efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp court fee, including the high levels two years ago for second property and properties purchased for rental purposes, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring in up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which leads to higher prices and puts those who want to buy their first home in difficulty.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the seal tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction firms of maintaining high property prices as a result of buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to waive taxes on affordable homes in order to solve the “house problem” in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive real estate reform proposals, including lease controls and the cessation of unwarranted evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I stated that I will dedicate my prime ministership to fulfilling the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the existing problems in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to be able to buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and living in unworthy conditions is far too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland’s national team”
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said his "final goal" was to become, at some point, the manager of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of “reviving” the North-Eastern club, which is currently in 3rd place in the Premier League, with a three-point difference from first place.
He moved to the team at the Stadium of Light this summer after he managed, last season, the return of the St. Mirren football team in the first division of the Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got to the team B of the national team and that’s it,” Ross told Sportssound on BBC Scotland.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood watching the Scottish games at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as manager of the club.”
Ross's predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he has no emotions about being the successor to such names in such an important club after he refused bids from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that worries me and that could affect my success is the question, ‘Can I help this team get back in the Premier League?’
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to make it there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel a successful man is contributing to the club’s return to the Premier League.”
Ross has only three years of leadership experience, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
He then helped Alloa recover after relegating to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship next season.
Ross said he is feeling better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a decisive moment,” he said of taking over the leadership of the Alloa club.
“I thought I was better off as a manager than as a player.
“Maybe it sounds weird, because we had a good time, we were winning well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel it’s the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel it’s the thing that suits me the best in my whole adult life.”

The heatwave this summer has led to an increase in revenues in UK pubs, but puts more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars saw an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of CGA, which provides business consulting services and conducted the survey, said: “The constant warmth and England’s participation in the World Cup for a longer period than expected contributed to a pattern in July, similar to that of the previous month, when pubs recorded an increase of 2 percent per restaurant in May.
The number of customers by 1.8% in the restaurant industry since June has fallen even further in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have made a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food have experienced heat losses, but not as large as those in restaurants.
It turns out that people went out to the city just to drink.
Beverage sales at all bars and pubs rose 6.6% this month, and food fell 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s representative in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to lose, although a drop in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be added to current cost pressures.
“The long cannibal summer could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.”
Total sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, increased by 2.7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly launched venues.
The company that monitors UK pubs, bars and restaurants sales, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children, some even up to 11 years old, has a secret account on a social network that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “false Insta” accounts.
The news has heightened fears about sexually explicit posts
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show their parents
One in five children, some even up to the age of 11, creates an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid rise in Insta fake accounts, citing the Instagram photo-sharing platform.
The news has heightened fears about sexually explicit posts.
20% of students said they have a “main” and “clean” account that they show their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed the posting of a teenager asking to be "violated".
According to research conducted by Digital Awareness in the UK and the HMC (Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to holding secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “Athletes’ Voice” in the Scottish Athletes’ Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletes’ Commission at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those making decisions regarding sporting activity to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes from Scotland, the UK, as well as around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with his inclusion on the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m delighted to be able to represent the athletes and I hope to have a real contribution and be able to help the way sporting activities are conducted in Scotland.”
The U.S. national athlete, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter tests at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC, and has remained invalid after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if I will recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!”
An ad at breast pumps that compares women with cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A company producing breast pumps has sparked a split of public opinion in the online environment with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be “the world’s first silent and portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ironic ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of hay for cows on a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm grinding, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not ugly, they're my breasts."
The saying goes, “I pump, I pump, I breastfeed, I pump, I pump, I extract milk from girls.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been the target of mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it exposes the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen only a few days after birth.”

Another person commented: “It’s understandable how traumatic it is for both the mother and the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “An extremely inappropriate advertisement.”
Others defended the ad, a person claiming that it seemed to him a “wonderful” ad.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pump really made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad targeting mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilets) and who feel like ‘learning’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with discreet pumps inserted into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms and even get out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, Partner, Consultant and Design Developer at Mother commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump has hit the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been transferred to a refugee camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children in sponsorship.
Typically, many sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear they will endanger their stay in the country if they apply to take children.
The risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Approximately 80% of people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors live illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we’ll continue to look for those individuals,” Albence said.
To speed up the process of processing children in the system, authorities have introduced new rules that require children to appear in court one month after detention, rather than 60 days as required by the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will plead for the case through a video call, and not personally in front of an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and system reports in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs that a child has problems are not observed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends could cause them trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria Calls for US, French and Turkish Military Forces to Withdraw Immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the interim prime minister, said foreign military forces are illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "the situation will be handled appropriately".
"These must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He also said Damascus would continue “this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
There are about 2,000 U.S. military troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said there were favorable conditions for their return and accused "a few Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", prompting refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return.”
“Political influences are being brought into an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to avoid a large-scale assault with the help of Russian-backed Syrian forces on the three-million-strong province.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have ties to the Al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes to soon meet at a first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, declaring that the committee’s activities should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and issued a warning of interference.
Why will Trump win a second term?
If we follow this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment procedure or scandals end sooner, which much of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidential term of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in prime-time, Fox News is watched by an average of 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was watched by 1.7 million, and the show "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC recorded a record audience, with 3.5 million people who watched it in the important evenings.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we can't understand it," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's drama "Reserve President," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is exploited.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be whole and about the state of the global economy.
Changing posts is a luxury that only privileged audiences can afford.
However, you're not just an informed citizen when you get to the "sixth hour" of Trump's viewing of the debate by a panel of experts on how Bob Woodward uses "deep background" (confidential) sources for his book, "Fear", about Paul's ostrich leather jacket.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A lot of what he does gives you the feeling that you're watching a reality show and feeds you with topics every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the American media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Ass of the Handcuff", about the constantly changing distribution and the daily upheavals of the situation caused by Trump.
Don’t allow yourself to lose an episode, because you’ll feel like you’ve been left behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his house on the northern shore of Kauai Island, it was 27 degrees outside and it was sunshine, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He could not unleash himself in front of the television, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing some unusual shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right.”

Overwhelming external financial resources for the tightest interim elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the electoral districts, which resulted in two incumbents in an election race for the same position, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of the Pittsburgh district put Democratic Representative Conor Lamb in the race, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, manipulating the district boundaries in favor of Republicans.
The race in the 17th new electoral district sparked a competition in funding campaigns between major party funding bodies, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a special, high-hearted election that took place in March for Pennsylvania's 18th electoral district.
For more than a decade, the office was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing the state of El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but then gave up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to summon U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high unemployment and crime rate in it.
As internal meetings have made progress, officials in North and Central America have postponed a high-level security and economic prosperity-focused conference to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from being sent to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials at the top of the administration had made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, wishing to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic deliberations only if they remain anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst who is a close relative of the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
Mueller also appears to be directing his investigation into the existence of a plot between Trump’s campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face proper accountability within the body, even as he prepares to stand before the electorate and possibly a jury of his peers.
There are many possible situations and I don’t want to suggest that a “fall” of Trump is inevitable, which is also true for his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic and that will determine the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike a coup against Hitler, only if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing some such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year he suggested the secret registration of the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovak origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the bassinet.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match against the Austrians, after Spain’s impressive draw against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put her in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season until 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers team can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performances.
“It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game thinking that we would get a good result and we won a point.
We could probably have scored in the final, but overall, I think the draw was the right result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
Thursday will be an important day for Europe.
With a little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last match played. However, having the support of the fans, we will certainly feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and the changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the guys really like to be here; the training is also going well.
Let’s hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind what happened in the last season and that we will have good results.”
Women have insomnia due to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about this.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said they had talked to their children about the subject.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t initiate this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
Here's how you can get started.
Discuss with your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with the care you need if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial adviser: and the financial adviser can be a real help in paying these expenses.
Your funding choices for long-term care can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover those expenses, or you can insure your own well-being – to the extent you have the money.
Get your legal documents up to date: come to face problems of a legal nature.
Get a medical decision-making authority to appoint a trusted person to oversee your healthcare and ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you can’t communicate them.
Also, consider making an authorization regarding your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions on your behalf and who ensures that your bills are paid if you do not have the necessary capacity to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that a parent of yours at an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not all about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are taking care of it?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of their dog?
Write a plan for all these things.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to increase.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, authorities dealing with disasters were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area in the northern city of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating 40 years of existence when it was hit by a tsunami and an earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along a coast with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region located at the bottom of a province, has a population of about 299.200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture activities are the central point of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Mining activities for nickel extraction are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala Regency, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, in the north of Sumatra Island, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of the island of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Richter scale hit the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake on the Richter scale occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra Island, triggering a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami, which resulted in a large number of deaths.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Several powerful earthquakes have occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the deaths of more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a complaint of domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by police in the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to claim the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit pending trial, and is detained on the basis of a $500 bail guarantee, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "100 percent innocent" when his plea was requested, according to the network.
Palin faces three class A charges, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with such a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged aggression.
The case is being tried at the Alaska Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence crime complaint and holding a gun while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffers from after joining the Iraqi military.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred in central Sulawesi province, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social networks circulate videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutor Wants Death Penalty for Suspect of New York City Terrorist Attack
The New York federal prosecutor’s office wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It appears that Saipov, 30, used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his trajectory in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors need to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both prosecutions may receive a capital sentence, according to the court’s document.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of indictment that included eight counts of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as an accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit the act of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's husbands were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, an Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of the ISIS group on his phone, according to the plaintiff.
According to the police, he also asked to hoist the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defendants in the office who represented Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, instead of accepting a plea of guilt with life imprisonment, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the death penalty.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today that he would “mobilize the civilian army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics, following a statement by MP Theresa May who suggested she should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "exited" by now if Farage had been secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge May faces with regard to extremely divided camps has been accentuated by members of the Conservative Party who have joined another protest against leaving the European Union organised in the city.
The prime minister is trying hard to ensure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, is properly implemented, confronting the attacks from those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as from the European Union.
Allies stressed that it will continue to try to conclude a deal with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and “chaos.”
Bone said at the “Leave Means Leave” pro-Brexit event in Solihull that he wanted to “renounce the Chequers plan”.
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If things had been led by him, we would no longer be in the European Union,” he said.
The Conservative MP, the Wellingborough constituency representative, added: “I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions for a change of public opinion in the 2016 vote: “It is not true at all that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “All I want to say is: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
“The public doesn’t agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition won’t vote for it, our party doesn’t agree with it and our activists who go out and support us, first and foremost, in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Theresa May, she added: “The prime ministers who keep their job are the ones who keep their promises.”
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to “feel the pressure” if they are about to give up the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we’re not going to let them do this.”
In a message to enthusiastic satisfaction, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those who support staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners saying “The Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can implement IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a prank.
Brexit does not bring any benefits,” he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a town hall meeting in the western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, a member of the Republican House of Representatives who was co-chairman of Donald Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with eligible citizens using the city hall format since Trump took office as president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that “the time has come for women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government, and this includes a woman at the head of it.”
A suspect was arrested in the case of the death that caused the death of the Sims player from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday that a suspect in the death that caused the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, that he was in possession of a gun, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 1.98-foot-tall junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the initial batch last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will have an essential role in the race.
Standing first in the rankings, Bottas had a good start and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the boxing and left Hamilton at the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the boxing one lap later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after some schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, after making a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race on the back row of the track and was in seventh place near the end of the first lap, just on the day he turned 21.
He then headed for much of the race, aiming for a quick final and trying to beat Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He eventually stopped boxing at the 44th round, but was unable to step up in the last eight rounds, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
“It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and he behaved like a real gentleman, letting me get ahead.
And the team did an excellent job to get the win ahead of Ferrari and to make this double," Hamilton said.
A horrific body language
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a rally over her insistence that she did not facilitate the “leak” of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are “bad, immoral, and liars.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying,” he said.
“When you see that they published and leaked information and then they say they didn’t.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember that?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the leak of the document?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..please?
Aaa... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we do this?...No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "leaked" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "leak" occurred from her office.
“I have not concealed the allegations that concern Ford and I am not the one who facilitated the ‘leak’ of her report,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial does not seem to have fallen well with the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but it was the most horrific body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the allegations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to take power in every way possible.
Notice evil, immorality, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to destroy in order to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 against the Giants in Belfast
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Stars of Dundee paid for Friday's loss in the Elite League, winning against the Giants of Belfast in the return match on Saturday, with the score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, the hits being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard tied the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat this season for Adam Keefe’s players, who had regained ground by defeating the Dundee team 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening show kicked off in the fourth minute, 3:35, from a pass from Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan brought the host team back into play in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the opportunity to score for an equal score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard equated again with an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later, in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring the team's rise to 5th place in the standings, around the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies after securing the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake on Friday shook the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong replicas in the area and many people are trapped under the remnants of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Palu’s Sis Al Jufri Airport, which was shaking violently.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, will take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed he was about to crash.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency declaring that access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“We believe that the number will increase because many victims are still in ruins and we have not had access to many of them,” the agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said in a statement.
Waves of up to six meters in height devastated the city of Palu, with a joint funeral to be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimarkets are being robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which left more than 550 people dead.
Aviation Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini Now Says Person Is Missing After Plane Collapses in Lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now claims one person is missing, after previously declaring that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has disappeared since Saturday afternoon.
She also said she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane missed the runway and landed in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe the plane crossed the end of the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very short distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the waist, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said the crew members panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to renovate a landing gear jumped in, using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank 30 meters underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of some airlines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini plane.
Analyst presents the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded its pleadings regarding the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning down a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst in the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the recordings on his mobile phone to overturn the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, as well as those of his 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night he was killed, contradicting his earlier claims, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
By the time the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was summoned to the witness box and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s van that night, Sanford said he “lied because my van was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Records on mobile phones indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final pleading on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this genre of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
The band The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has stopped sending political messages and addressing social issues, as it did initially.
They want to go back to the origins and make hip-hop consciously popular again.
There has been a recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another person of color?
A New York babysitter sues a couple for firing her after she received a "racist" text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for dismissal on discriminatory grounds after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denied that they were racists, claiming that she had sued them for “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dissatisfaction when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was of color when she presented herself on her first day of work in 2016.
“NEW! THAT’S A COLOR PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the gag, Plasco-Flaxman, feeling embarrassed, fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, had not done her duties properly and that she expected to receive an appropriate nanny from the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her workday and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple to be awarded compensation for dismissal and demands the amount of $350 a day for six months, the period during which she had to live with them and carry out her work, despite the fact that this is done without a contract concluded.
“I want to show them that such things are not being done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denies claims that they are racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent him the wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco, her husband, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been wrong about, even if it was a mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process an act of “extortion,” Plasco said his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
This is not the case,” added the bank investor.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for the behavior and logic they have demonstrated.
The editors of Paddington's story feared readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the skin of a person reading it for the first time before it's published.
It’s very funny now that we’ve seen Paddington have had a huge success.”
She also said her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary of the book's 60th anniversary was a "sweet one."
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success he enjoyed later.
“He was a fairly quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not your success.
I think that’s how he saw Paddington’s success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington credit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“He’s calling frequently to tell me that it’s very serious and that he doesn’t think he’ll survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she’s going to die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, “Tashi, dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications taken by doctors to keep her heart pumping blood began to diminish and come out of her body.
He died a short time ago and his organs were no longer functioning.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, grieving the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears didn’t stop flowing.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized that he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two grieving women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers that people can call for support.
Sharon Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a grinding smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said that his smile would change your mood.”
However, he quit work before he died because he had reached a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Davis said, "I keep thinking you're going to have a domino effect."
It created the messages “to tell people that they can call someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Get outside, you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, Davies's longtime friend, lost Mark, his 15-year-old life partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or he was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that his attitude had changed.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and didn’t even look them in the eye.”
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but he must overcome it: “It caused a huge pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to move on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake, following the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation
“I thought if we could get something similar to what he was asking for — a limited time and small-scale investigation — we might have a little unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he fears the commission is about to “disintegrate,” amid a partisan blockade.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reticence is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 election - if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to place the winner they want in the election for the country's highest court will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush has always appealed to senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make a difference in the case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees is falling under Kim's leadership.
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said about 1,127 people fled the country last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by those who illegally transport people across the border.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily demilitarized protected zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for some talks on denuclearization talks.
This took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions of causing the lack of progress since then.
"If we can't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security, and in such situations, we won't be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical," declaring he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court as "hysterical" and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if she were a woman in this situation, she would have been declared 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes nearly screaming and losing his voice due to emotions while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him “a murder of a grotesque and coordinated character” organized by the angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has shown a partisan character against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi diverted from the subject when asked whether she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and whether Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I just want to say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he’s not suitable, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe versus Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Oh, that’s great!’,” Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, it is months and years of accumulated anger and cannot speak without bursting into tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, is it?”
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in an executive position, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that, when she was angry and she started crying, she told the person she was talking to, ‘I thought she could talk to.
I'm nervous."
And then go on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing."
Tears are allowed for the exteriorization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I began to cry because of an inexpressible anger, is that I was grabbed by the neck of an older woman, a cold director to whom I always felt a little frightened, and I went home.
“She never has to see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
I think you’re sad and they’ll be happy to have caused you that feeling.”

In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision,” she says, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as “White as Snow and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fundraising and swore she would not enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000, they gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting discounts?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by emotions – as a result of gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration caused by the system, and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters that the voice of the delegates, but also the voice of anger – was distracted.
“You would have said I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the media’s reaction to her.
“You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex.”
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my funeral stone.
“Are you crying?”
How can the trade war between the United States and China benefit Beijing?
The oaths that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China have been daunting and, although there seems to be a long way to go before it ends, the disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new taxes affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, effectively charging taxes on half of all goods in China entering the United States.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently by imposing a 5 to 10 percent tax on US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every U.S. strike and is unlikely the world’s second-largest economy to take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its demands, but publicly yielding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. trade war pressures could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision made in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than previously anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things return to normal.
The existing conditions allow refugees to voluntarily return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011 when the war broke out.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by the insurgency will not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded its sixth consecutive win in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts for most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial kick in the water to hair 3 from hole 16, giving up the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all rebounds, becoming one of four players with a 5-0-0 score since the tournament's current format existed in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost in the 5th and 4th holes to the last-placed player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson lost to England's Ian Poulter in the 2nd and 1st holes, probably his last Ryder Cup match.
A Ryder Cup veteran who has participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, has become the European player with the most wins, averaging 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I’m not used to crying, but today I can’t refrain.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I am extremely happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It's teamwork and I'm glad we could help," Garcia said, excited, after the European victory.
He handed over his staff to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Throughout the weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinary throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they’ve really worked hard.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've fought a fierce battle.
Put down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
We must give them due respect.
They played better than us.”
