During the emergency call, the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend.
During the call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come home.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset at home, and that contacts to the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on a white office paper: "I am so sorry and wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she is the only one who has ever loved me," the letter, which was signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to a school campus where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said the university's staff heard the gunshots at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fateful phone call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting in the school forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details, published by state investigators and students and staff who knew him, together created the image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent background.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in gratitude to the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students attended courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were tendencies in terms of problems.
A student praising Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "like something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
William LaForge, the president of the university, said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb seemed to be bothering something."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, police caught his footprint as he crossed the Arkansas state border back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with the only shot from a gun in the yard of a house about a mile from his parents in the suburb of Greenville in Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, though Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb has grown up in this region.
Lamb started working at a university that has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older boy who taught her to play the guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
The hearts of all the girls vanished as soon as he appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for some time.
During an emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the Gautier River.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She was my best friend with my mother.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when she and Abigail ran off at a summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a sparsely lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the sweat Lamb played on guitar and harmonica for an innumerable crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We were smiling and recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in his first year and specialised in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boy's student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight commemoration event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School started again on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made an emergency call after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually taken.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says they won’t hire as many seasonal workers as they did last year, but a children’s toy and product manufacturer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire around 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will begin recruiting candidates this month, and will recruit employees during October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees for help in stores and sales, for shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "dating" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I figured Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in time."
The movie starts, and I realize I'm on the verge of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," which features interviews with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “It’s really the best travel documentary I’ve ever filmed.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief once again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the outskirts of the General Assembly meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers “made this situation insoluble.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity as they reached an Iranian nuclear deal to resolve the crisis in Syria.
8 Election Numbers That Show That Donald Trump Is Real
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands as if they were joking.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But no matter how many Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they fail (for now).
10 of the last 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is in the lead by a two-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously wonder what it means for the nomination chances of this real estate magnate.
Of course, it is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership made the way for Herman Cain’s rise, eventually none of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run in general elections.
But outside groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are realizing Trump’s willingness to endure and are beginning to put their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that a real estate magnate is not just a passing phase:
Trump's rating of favor has been reversed by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a vote at Monmouth University showed that only two in 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are held in the early stages.
After a Quinnipiac poll last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be “sad” with his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “enthusiastic” against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next on the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “disturbed” if the company’s favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his puffiness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to think that the real estate tycoon has the right temperament for the post of president, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number is held at the Iowa State Senate Club, which is the first in the entire country, where 52 percent of Republicans think it has a commander-in-chief, according to last week's Quinnipiac.
Yet 44 percent think he has no personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When he puts on his scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 gambled their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
In the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans have chosen Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump will defeat almost everyone.
Some scholars emphasize that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey in early September shows that in the hypothetical direct battle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gains majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would lead the trader by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The vast majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have already made their point.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump supporters say they will not change their minds.
It is obvious that this can change a lot of things, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46% say they keep their back doors open for change between candidates.
Still, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider fellow neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign announcement speech, immigration has still held up as the main and central theme of the conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump’s puffiness will distract key Hispanic voters from the Republican party and the damage will push for rebranding.
But according to a new Monday public opinion poll by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
The frustration of the government is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half the support of Republican voters, mainly due to their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll on Monday said they wanted a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
They are also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "infernally angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state's coal levies.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
The House of Representatives in the first reading supported the government's amendment to the upper law, which regulates the amount of revenue from brown coal surface mining from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) promised MPs that they would receive additional money from both the state treasury and municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government's amendment of the upper law, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a greater part of the payments from the state.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the compensation for the losses that companies will extract.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring the Treasury with 427 million kronor more than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipalities should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received about 450 million crowns from the fees and 150 million crowns from the state budget.
From the extraction of brown coal, the municipalities went about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The novel also expects to increase the payment from mining areas with permissible mining to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
Revenue from these payments should continue to belong in full to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that as a result, the municipalities will receive between 14 million and 100 million crowns a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
The reimbursement shall be recalculated as the sum of the quantities of extracted minerals and the rates for each mineral species.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned that fixing the fee by government regulation may not be in accordance with the constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládka, this is not a tax in this case, because the state pays for minerals, which are state property.
Fees are only granted to municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money of the municipality and a quarter of the state will be given.
The same will apply to the mining of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state collects from the mining fees will be purpose-bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The proposal was criticized by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would harm mining-affected communities and regions.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the finance minister's budget," said David Kádner, elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
Hana Aulická, a member of the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M, warned against the rise of unemployment in Mostek.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed the novel to be rejected, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for revision.
The reasoning report states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not penetrate coal prices, as prices are contracted out of more than 90 percent in the long run.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heaters, should therefore not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it believes that the increase in employment fees is bearable.
According to the rapporteur on the Milan Urbana (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) novelty, it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and especially the government’s decision on the limits of coal mining even before the approval of the law.
If coal is extracted even beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the boundary at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fall only after 2020.
According to him, the limits on the <0xC4><0x8C>SA mine should be broken due to social, economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Cheerful will lead the Czech Republic as one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the table at the Thursday draw of the Davis Cup in India, and this time each of them will most likely be involved in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to spread the burden on the entire quartet due to the difficult conditions.
With the warmth and high humidity in Delhi, tough matches are expected, which can reach up to five hundred.
We have to take this into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather.
And according to what it will look like, he said he returned during today’s Czech selection training in the center of Raja Kum<0xC4><0x81>r Kh<0xC4><0x81>nny.
With the team’s number one and the world’s forty, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> counts to the Friday and Sunday games.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Rosol and Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek will probably be in the second position.
I would like almost everyone to be involved.
"I've got it in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet," the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech composition should be <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánko’s participation in the Saturday quarter.
It’s just a question of who will stand next to the experienced deblist who has an 18:4 record in the Davis Cup.
He probably won't be happy.
There are still options with Rosol or Adam Pavlásko.
"I really don't know who or what it's going to look like," he said.
It will be decided according to the development of the two.
The variant can be Pavlásek, with the Joyful surprised in the 1st round by winning in the stakes over the Australians.
"He's decent in the trunk," he said.
I managed to do it against Australia, and if I play, I would like to perform the same performance I have shown there since the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience and I'd like to make a point," Pavlásek said.
Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won the challenger in Shanghai last week, defeated the third and fourth-hundred players in the rankings.
The pair will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both players are challengers and ours have experience from the ATP Tour, but we’ve seen many times that the Davis Cup ranks don’t make a decision.
"It decides the current form, the weather," he said.
Friday's opening games start at 6:30 p.m. and may be extended due to weather.
It is predicted to rain and the courtyard is not under the roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already set it on fire, and it's about 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be done under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut in the PMQ has been highly anticipated.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later on, and will be working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance will likely be carefully examined by the media and MEPs.
In a weekly statement, he demanded "less theatre and more facts."
He also said he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby’s leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech at the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence while singing the national anthem in service on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the newspaper's front page.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention.
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in respectful silence" and acknowledge "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle for Britain."
However, Corbyn’s shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told BBC Two’s Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economics, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says the political differences in work are also "flattering" after Mr Corbyn's appointment over his position in the European Union and the government's allowance limit.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers’ Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the benefit limit.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party “very clearly” opposed government plans to reduce the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers’ Party to face David Cameron in the last decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The leader of the Labour Party, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from the crowd” on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQs are too confrontational and will refrain from both “emergency responses” and toothed trade, promising instead to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him on PMQ if he doesn’t participate — like when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also forsook the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time, as he was told that he was still discussing the whole matter with the Speaker of the House, John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to deviate from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics, which was often associated with the PMQ, but a few years later admitted he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, the PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the judgement of leaders, their leadership of the House, and their stance among other MPs, despite critics arguing that they have become cartoons and that far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Shooting in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homelessness.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn and make a living.
"I Was Photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise, while wage growth in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped the following dates and showed a recovery in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led upwards using the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, GB’s earnings, including bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed as if the estimates were approaching when the rates would rise.
The sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% at 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped by 20% after getting a close offer from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Stocks in the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest downturn on the index and fell by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs lowered its rating to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in half-year earnings before tax of <0xC2><0xA3>46.6m
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he said.
The costs could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of Prague's Marshmallow dwelling are cheering.
The controversy has come to a halt.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested in front of the Prague office against the construction, which is to be built in close proximity to the Ane<0xC5><0xBE> Monastery in the center of Prague, and a petition was created.
In the decision, the Magistrate stated that there was a violation of the Construction Act because not all the requirements of the territorial decision were complied with.
"The territorial decision in question does not contain certain elements, for example, the type of land, the distance from neighboring buildings, a sufficiently clear and clearly described form of the building, the delimitation of the territory affected by the influence of the construction," the decision states.
The magistrate also considers it illegal that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the documentation originally discussed, but that it has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the plots of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the filing material that, however, the landowner has only submitted a consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not a consent to the location of the building on his lands, the Department of the Building Code writes.
According to Francesco Augusto Razett of the investment firm, the Department of Construction did not take note of the decision of the supervisory authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review has already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call a marshmallow because of the supposedly proposed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre in the past to protest the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby homes are upset that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the construction for the historical center of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE> Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Fránek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which had a glazed facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Monument Institute (NP<0xC3><0x9A>) and in 2010 the permission of Prague monuments was revoked.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the NPU and the Magistrate’s memorials and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the grudges of the opponents, saying he never counted on a façade in pink, which gave the project a nickname for a pink-and-white candy.
Czech politicians brought migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg traveled to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, who were said to be about half a kilometer away.
At the time, it was not criminal in Hungary, he told the People's Newspaper.
We knew that the guards of the law did not take such action.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and took us to an investigative detention center in Szeged, he described the letter.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
The police said they behaved correctly, but the communication was limited because they did not speak English very well.
The prison, he said, was sad.
For example, in our cell about three times four meters in size, 15 refugees from Syria were oppressed.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up the next day and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, Berg said.
What can't be fun anymore?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday, 18.9. from 9:30, the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic, Mgr. Pavla Fu<0xC4><0x8D>íková, will answer the questions of the readers.
You can ask her about amendments to the Executions Act in force from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to executions or executors.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash strives to protect its IGA stores from the influence of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide.
IGA dealers and suppliers are joining brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo’s offering tastings in IGA stores and store owners are selling discounted Australian Football League tickets to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and hardware vendor celebrates its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake because South and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA trading steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notorious for being provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi is investing in 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores to take over revenues from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in Western Australia over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in Metcash’s solid price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said Melbourne’s trading lunches could “highly likely disappear within a decade.”
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Douglass’ comment.
But it is known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash’s earnings from the food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have declined by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational evolution of the speculation shift as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler has gone to counterattack and is investing more than $150 million annually to match the counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers reequip stores by adding fast-growing food and private news.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says its pricing and trade rebalancing programs are catching up, hoping the wholesaler will return to core profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis Supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a secondary loser in a recent clash around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention thanks to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly afterwards, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by a referee, Harrison then stated, "Wawrinka was supposed to pull one out of Kyrgios and I was supposed to pull it out of him as well."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after a spasm crushed Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for a place in the second half behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
"I was thinking quite intensely that in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit involved in the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed a rocket when he lost to a spasm in the U.S., but he's not the first player to unleash anger on his rocket because of frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he really did manage very well, because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the U.S. because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves great recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he’s been treated a bit harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits great into the team and so on, he never had a problem with other players, in the locker room he is very respected, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own.
Healy also supported the decision to ignore Kyrgios due to an important match starting Friday, saying that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports a Canberry native to return to the team as a long-term striker.
“First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not all the controversy that has arisen around him,” says Healy.
And I think Nick has risen very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the eyes of the public, he is growing fast, he has also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he receives, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and for some time out.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who attempted to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, as hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and the Serbian authorities reacted outraged.
Those who have been stuck for an unknown time in the belts of the land between the two states are those who flee violence in their home countries, build tents and settle.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together shout “Open the border!” and attack the Hungarian police force.
Some people refuse food and water to protest.
The Serbian foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary as more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
Over the next few days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a single immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in surprise Italy and Greece, and spoke with hopes of reaching an agreement next month or at the end of the year, which would allow EU nations to accept more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not hope for Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday’s threat situation in two southern regions gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up court cases on asylum proceedings.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped pull the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other countries in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize violations of the 4-meter fence that the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer prison terms for those who transfer refugees illegally.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of threat," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we are quite clear: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, the parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters on the border have been observing a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic defense adviser, said authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 had already been caught in the state.
They penetrated through the fence damage and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under new laws.
The authorities quickly repaired the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at Roszka, chaos arose as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and people’s printing press was created.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary by refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 Elections: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders has been halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is reaching her lead.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (increase from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is due to announce whether or not he wants to become president, is getting support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it’s too early to say it’s a clear decision that the candidate will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground under the feet of several demographic groups, while Sanders has won several.
Clinton maintains a great lead among women and mitigates, but her leadership is shrinking.
Her support among men has declined significantly, and Sanders loses only 5 points to her.
Clinton’s advantage with Democratic voters under the age of 50 has vanished and they are now on par with Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to senior voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit lead over Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across states say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
6% would not support it.
It’s no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that it is time to be a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also a great opportunity to choose and agree on the problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to lead – a third in turn thinks he shouldn’t run.
When the primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party’s nomination, the most common choice was Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, she cited more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his nomination.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of a candidate, Democratic voters prefer to solve problems rather than have a greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate appears to be an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among their party’s primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads all three in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t think so.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are in line with their ideological views.
With regard to all these benchmarks, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of it has not affected her at all.
But it’s a completely different story for the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public’s views on the issue were divided as early as March, shortly after the issue emerged.
The majority of Americans claim that this email controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their view of Clinton.
It’s mostly about Republicans, where more than 6 in 10 say their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Despite being perceived as honest and trustworthy among her party’s voters, the issue remains a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, down by eight points from last month, and by 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think she is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best in honor.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters don’t have an opinion on him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the rest are left to seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23 percent in the latest CBS poll conducted ahead of the Fox News debate last month to 27 percent on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well across demographics, and ranks Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is lagging behind along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the standoff with 10% support falling to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place together with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll published last week showed that Carson improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s rising trend, Trump opted to shoot a neurosurgeon in-service, and Carson even apologized for questioning about Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First-Year Baruch College Student
Nearly two years after the student died during an overburdening brotherhood ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during the commencement ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his hospitalization, police said.
Police say he had his eyes tied, had a backpack full of sand weighing <0xC2><0xA3>30, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach the target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Dogs did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and allegedly waited an hour before being taken to the hospital, police said.
However, they found time to disguise Dengue's dress, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's nationwide president, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, members began hiding equipment and basically preferred the well-being of the fraternity over the life of Michael Deng,” said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit with a blunt object in the head, trunk and thigh.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity overload and at least one student has died each year from overload since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengo family, wrote in a statement.
The fraternity and its members must be held accountable, and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with harassment and criminal association.
"We want to detain not only those involved, but if there is an organization that approves it, whether officially or informally, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity and National Brotherhood canceled its relationship with local branches.
This is what happens when the Fed raises interest rates.
Rates will rise and the bull market will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy in particular, the history of the small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors shouldn’t be focused on when the rate hike will begin, but rather on the trajectory of how long the normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that any exclamation due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money' era," Julian Jessop, the chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more common but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the past month, the expected rate hike can make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
“There appears to be a trend for stocks to be suspended again 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy again,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed’s increase.
Specifically, the market for the last 35 years, the most often asset management - about 14 percent - aims to increase rates in a relatively flat in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with the average returns of the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and returns are starting to decline.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but rising rates often help it.
At present, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could accelerate the recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history when Fed rates rise.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal year-on-year GDP growth was below 4.5 percent.
Despite the fact that it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to be maintained, when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic backdrop could be risky and the question "is this time different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready for the Fed’s growth throughout the year and all eyes were on the Federal Free Market Committee meeting, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all of the increase cycles so far have been in a super-cycle of leverage increase with GDP covering the peaks of the early recession very quickly after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, we are now at 74 months and we are still continuing.
Fixed yield was also volatile, as the market expects rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
In the case of bonds, returns appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle, bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe that rising rates will bring yields between long- and short-dated bonds closer together, which will equalize the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in this climate, although “we are still cautious about tightening yields,” said Kathy Jones, a firm fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospects of a more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is flatter, the credit gap has expanded, and volatility has increased – all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
In general, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with a lot of debt will fare worse, as the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt will also be larger.
"History shows that the 'quality' of stocks tends to outperform within three months of the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheet companies in every interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also surpassed their lower quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers are also benefiting from the growing dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "deafness"
He maintains that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they are simply cheating on the British.
Colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says it's not an original idea either
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" into Classic FM, says a leading MP and is putting fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove that they are doing something that commercial broadcasting is not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC heads that the public service radio station appears to be "deaf" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
“Radio 3 seems to be — I don’t like to use the word ‘deaf’ — but it seems to be changing to Classic FM,” he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which began in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different – these are two examples that come to mind when you’re actually just imitating what we already have on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC Director General rejected the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I would not have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and making music is actually at a top level.
“I also think Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important,” he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got fired for kicking in the heels of commercial competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sports and got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is being debated as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the September star Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a BBC-typical manner."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" next time it launches the entertaining series.
However, he refused to exclude ordering more future series of The Voice or spending taxpayers' money on license fees for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be the culprit
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since the records themselves began in the year 2000.
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday could be a reason to slow down spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise and has made many of Britain’s main streets ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of a stabilization of online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the measurement in 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs of a stabilization of online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the level of growth over the past few years and go back to 2000, the situation has always rationalized over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, IMRG’s revenue index editor.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in a variety of contexts, such as on the couch.
But now (growth) is stagnating a bit, so it seems to be waning.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers might be delaying purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
In the past year, more than five times the average shopper turned to their computers to arrange purchases while dropping several vendor websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers re-negotiate, can keep customers from making further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of a crane in Mecca and the family of bin Laden was sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were taken to the streets by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of construction tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the fall of a crane in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Clothed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose their way and paid homage to the victims when the first of the fallen arrived on his last journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
A sad message passed around the holy place, where just a few days before the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the believer.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned a construction group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 people killed in the fall of a crane at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried to the streets.
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, the Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi news agency, states that Binladin Group bears part of the blame for the fall.
The record company's English service did not report the details, but said the company's chief executives were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims converge on the pilgrimage of the Hajj later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of failing to use the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with weather officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and runs large construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was the son of an apostate whose family renounced in the 1990s.

B&Q CEO Says Eastern European Traders Are Already Working for Cheap
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laura
The number of educated traders from Eastern Europe is behind the point of growth
The result is an open 200 Screwfix trades aimed at traders
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Edited by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to put hammers and brushes away and hand them over to skilled Eastern European craftsmen to work at their homes.
If you're doing well with a hammer or painter's brush, it seems like you're in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do cutlery work at their homes, according to the head of the company for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laura, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a household supply chain, says a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix retail stores and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Laura says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halves.
Today, the majority of workers are male.
She said there is a need to address growing demographic trends that show more female households doing more household adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says: "We still have mostly men working in the shops.
We need to get closer to equilibrium.
In fact, half of our customers are women, who make 80% of the decisions regarding the purchase of goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to the UK FTSE100 index, also restructured her top team to reflect equality between men and women CEOs.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in that it has half the representation of women among employees including the executive and financial director.
Laura says: “It was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't hard to find a good woman to take with us.
Kingfisher announced a decline in both profits in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the costs of closing trades.
As a result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, to open 200 new stores
In December, the pensioner's contribution of 600 kronor is at risk.
"It's a justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
ODS MP Zbyn<0xC4><0x9B>k Stanjura noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in the standard valuation, because it would be projected into the next years.
"We have room to find the mechanism by which we can arrange it," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marks (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), according to which it should be valued beyond the framework of the law next year.
Marx defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not pink.
Higher valuation next year would have a budget impact of CZK 5.5 billion, she said, and ministers are debating each stamillion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) reminded the right that in the past, the rate of valuation has decreased.
Reporter Miroslav Opálka (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and beyond.
The right to pay veto in December will complicate and perhaps even make it impossible, he said.
Members of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed a shortening of the deadline for discussing the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, which the right blocked.
The committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should be worth a total of 1.73 billion kronor.
The money should come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the coming year, pensions are expected to rise on average by about one hundred kronor.
The contribution should be given according to the pension amendment to people who will be entitled to a pension in December or part of it.
It can also be obtained by those who have lost their pension entitlement in December before it is paid.
However, they would have to apply in writing, at the latest by the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valued by January, on the rise of prices and a third of the growth of real wages.
This year’s pension is 41.5% of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5%.
The state spent 314.7 billion crowns on old-age pensions last year, an increase of about five billion crowns year-on-year, according to the state’s final accounts.
Old-age pension expenditures accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all statutory expenditures.
The average full old-age pension last year rose by 104 to 10,714 kronor, according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration ensured the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin left plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
According to Russian media, the Senate chair was almost certain.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the Zaporozhye Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate for the United Russia government party, defended his position in Sunday's elections with an oversight.
According to Russian law, senators do not elect citizens, but are chosen by the governor from a trio of candidates, whose names they announce before the governor's elections.
After the election, the senator will be chosen from among the three candidates.
A complication for Jakunin was the fact that he did not live in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin, however, has found an exception for Yakunin, who is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, who is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger is over.
The last drop in the main hero's purpose is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Jan<0xC5><0xBE>urová decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he and his wife Olga - Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerová are on a similar journey.
He will remember that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live in dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain control of his life – and as a solution, he chooses to escape from the past, Slavik said.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedic form a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would belong to Bartosk, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
However, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a hooked athlete.
Before filming the next scene, he always wondered where he would be sitting.
This time he was riding a bike, climbing rocks and even walking a hill.
And all this in record-breaking tropical heat, the director said.
According to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ka, women take a tiger to make a rabbit over time.
They feed him a little, but they close the door immediately, so that he doesn't accidentally think about playing outside the tiger rabbit shop.
And that’s what we’re trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who can have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and thinks well.
But at the same time, she is an usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also portrays the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Tá<0xC5><0x88>a Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and son-in-laws Erika and Pepík - Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google has pledged to provide up to $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees fleeing to Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charitable subsidiary of the Internet company.
Azerbaijan has cancelled part of Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka’s visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP Pavel Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ek has postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday after Azerbaijani authorities canceled the official part of his visit.
According to Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Baku justifies this in the EP resolution of last week, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka was a co-author.
With the decision of the Azerbaijani side, Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka lost the possibility of talks with official partners, as well as the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
The trip, which was planned several months in advance, was intended to be used by Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive, as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the <0xC4><0x8C>TK clarified.
The resolution condemns "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European officials to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after a recent ruling on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadija Ismail, who was advocating for uncovering corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out the construction of an air base in Syria.
During his visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out the creation of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have any plans yet.
But nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has a long-standing naval base in Syria at the port of Tartus, which it used as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian media reports, since the beginning of August, Russian arms and military supplies to Syria have risen.
According to Moscow, these are weapons consignments resulting from the current trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians are planning to set up an air base near the city of Latakia, which for now remains the basilica of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Washington, however, is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, according to American commentators.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Tuesday with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria, their third phone call in ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to express concern over the Russian arsenal gathering near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Moscow’s support for Assad was a losing bet.
He said Russia’s policy objectives in Syria were rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has made its own satellite from Syria.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a rather long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is supposed to be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York, according to today’s Russian press speculation.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to speak at all about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbass.
According to a report in The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama may meet with the Russian president during a U.N. meeting.
Opinions among White House advisers are still divergent.
TASS, citing Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, said Putin had not yet met with Obama on his New York trip.
Sesame oil is used in the gallbladder diet, hemp helps strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing from the seeds in the cold, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of healthy diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common cause of death for Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, sesame oil helps.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you should not miss sesame oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% of the causes of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, gallbladder problems mainly affect overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fat.
Sesame oil can be successfully used even in the liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should beware of goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
But the oil will lose all the active substances, Ladislav Ha<0xC4><0x8D>eck<0xC3><0xBD>, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslic in Sokolovska, which produces organic virgin cold-pressed oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses only unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can squeeze 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is beneficial in diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among the oils is sunflower.
Research by Jarmila Hamerska, who led the Masaryk University, found that 43% of respondents preferred it in the warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it starts to overheat at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, to flavor salads and is especially suitable in the diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all the fatty acids reduce cholesterol levels the most.
In case of heart problems, it is necessary to pay attention to the amount of total intake of fat and calories.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil is 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil is 99 calories.
With regard to the energy value of food, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than the so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
This sunflower will last as long as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
Storage in the refrigerator extends the shelf life.
Old oil is known especially by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, the fault is not cloudy at the bottom.
It is a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Technical hemp seeds are among the so-called superfoods, and hemp oil is therefore considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be made by the body itself and must be taken from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not need to worry about the use of hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms that Bohemia Olej is one of the best-selling companies.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one tablespoon of it fasting in the morning.
Hemp oil is by no means tasty, but it greatly strengthens immunity, advised Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek of Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most invasive nation of grillers are Americans.
For one household there is 1.4 grills.
Around the world there are various barbecue competitions, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not behind.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people did not grill in their lives.
The vast majority then grills several times a year.
In order for grilling to be successful, we should not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is most suitable for this and at the same time leaves a beneficial substance for health when grilling?
In general, during the grilling process itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that a large portion of the oils begin to lose their appetite at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain from them when consuming oils from foods processed at lower temperatures.
This does not mean, however, that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, experts from the company Bohemia Olej from Kraslic in Sokolovska will immediately get grape oil.
It perfectly complements the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by a unique property of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, as one of the few oils, it preserves the health of a beneficial substance, Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Bohemia Olej describes the benefits of grape oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this grapevine oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
Furthermore, it contains a high amount of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also absorbs important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when tasting salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
Therefore, there are two ways to use grilling, marinating and grilling itself.
Marinating the meat and fish will preserve their juiciness.
In the preparation of the marinade, three ingredients must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we supply the acidity with apple cider vinegar to soften the meat.
The spice, in turn, adds flavor to the meat and preserves the oil and delivers the right cut, advises Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating directly because as one of the few oils it can pass through dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops of them are enough to prepare dishes.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This is especially true of flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grill with oil, thus preventing food from burning.
An essential part of grilling is also the preparation of attachments.
For grilled meat and fish, practically anything is suitable - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, a hot summer salad.
For it you need: • 1 piece of peaches • 1 bundle of rucola • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of a mixture of lettuce leaves • 3 tablespoons grape oil
In a salad bowl, add to the mixture of salad leaves grated rucola, chopped cucumbers and peach chopped into large cubes.
To taste, salt and pepper, you can also taste ground chili and soy sauce.
Finally, drizzle a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: It does not only depend on medications, but also on the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultation, if they decide to have a child, the care of these patients includes social legal advice, recommendations on housing adjustment, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not need to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As the doctors warn, the passivity of the sick frees up the space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement significantly delays the time when the patient needs some compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subjected to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is why the website Give yourself a chance (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In the case of multiple sclerosis, there is twice a saying that the sooner the disease begins to be treated, the more the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and postpone disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important for people with multiple sclerosis, which most often addresses weakening of the lower limbs or imbalance.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It is really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, Primary Director of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way in everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
Motion activity, however, also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive thing about regular exercise is the fact that the patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
"The endorphins are also washed away during exercise and the person feels well after it," says Dr. Kamila <0xC5><0xA0>asová from the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic of the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This is how we interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"In the past, these patients were so-called saved, today we know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolá<0xC5><0x99>, Head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic of the Motole University Hospital.
The goal of physiotherapy is that a person can remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including work inclusion.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergotherapists to get each person a compensation aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychiatrist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people will shake it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
It must respond to a great burden - the loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we should go to someone, not try to take everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to conclude that even with a disability one can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, the Airbus would not have flown.
Aircraft production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which no one can immediately manufacture and process.
Yet, alongside super-precise, computer-controlled machining machines, along with autoclaves for forming composites, you can come across something as common as peach peaches.
In the drum, which resembles a sugar wool pot, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are cleaned in the oven pile.
"No one has come up with anything better yet," smiles Ivan Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>, CEO of the aircraft door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the premises in Prague Let<0xC5><0x88>any, the former Letov manufactures complete doors for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world supplying doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which is assembled in Prague, also allow passengers to enter the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world’s largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
There are also doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the company allows the keys to be set twice a year.
If the yellow label lacks a check record, they should explain what to Airbus or Boeing auditors at the Prague plant, who regularly drive to see if the doors are manufactured according to agreed rules.
The human senses, however, have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There are 1,500 rivets on one door to the A320.
The rivets have to be cut by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the falling hammer, they will know if the rivet is already properly riveted.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The nest can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's about twice the thickness of human hair.
There will be a lot of trained touch during the check.
When the controller crosses a row of rivets, it knows if there is any outside of tolerance.
Only then does he take the exact deviation meter in his hand.
Letov fed the L-39 military training aircraft program before 1989.
In 1991, none of them were made.
The company had to quickly find new jobs.
At that time, it was merged with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the A321 emergency door supplier.
The talks with Boeing weren't that happy.
“We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable supplies,” recalls Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained locked if Letov had not attracted the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the international aviation industry association in 1999.
I was talking about our partnership with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new orders came with a strong company.
As early as 2000, the assembly of parts of the door for the A320 began.
Three years later, the top deck door for the A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoer, we wouldn't be able to get to these big orders ourselves.
Maybe we'd make parts or small parts.
Partners want 20 or 30-year supply guarantees, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> explains.
Last year Czech Latecoere achieved turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
Exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Since 2000, Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion kronor in Prague.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certifications and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company would not produce any aircraft doors.
Obtaining certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated checks to keep them costs according to the Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> million kronor.
Production processes change every year.
They are more precise and stricter.
We need to retrain our employees, equip the equipment and re-certify the entire process, adds Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
The company is now completing the preparation process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the previously harmful cadmium for human health.
They received the assignments from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people from Boeing will come, check the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
They test one set of samples themselves in their lab and then compare the results with ours, approximating the Dubsky way in which customers check them.
The reward is the Prague company’s long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embraers stands and falls.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But that doesn’t mean that he could say anything at the door.
The price curve is part of the contract.
It indicates how much one door will stand by ten, fifty, stitches made of pieces.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If not, we're going to lose, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are being completed, is still empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the curtain, a new semi-robot riveting and door assembly line is being built for the innovative A320 Neo.
The squeeze will be accelerated and refined.
"This is a trend that is taking place in the aviation industry," adds Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
The future line is secured.
Airbus has reportedly ordered 3,278 new A320s so far.
Just a few meters next to it will be a line for the complete mounting of the door for the top deck of the A380.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten production times and reduce costs.
The full assembly could begin in two years, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, before that, the company has to pass qualification tests for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also committed to further developing the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company to be able to process composites in addition to metal materials," Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> proudly says.
However, Latecoere is getting to the edge of production capacities in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place in the area of Letov where he resides.
Before the arrival of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now he has 800, and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of how many hundreds of new aircraft the airlines order each year, they may not have to worry about work.
Although he has contracts for several years ahead, the Prague-based parent company Latecoere faced a threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to repay the loans in September.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, some of the loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors acquired a 37.4 percent stake in the company by an increase in capital of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>57.4 million.

Members of Parliament supported a greater share of the state's coal taxes.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring the Treasury with 427 million kronor more than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipalities should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received about 450 million crowns from the fees and 150 million crowns from the state budget.
From the extraction of brown coal, the municipalities went about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The novel also expects to increase the payment from mining areas with permissible mining to a thousand crowns per one hectare per year.
Revenue from these payments should continue to belong in full to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that as a result, the municipalities will receive between 14 million and 100 million crowns a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
The reimbursement shall be recalculated as the sum of the quantities of extracted minerals and the rates for each mineral species.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned that fixing the fee by government regulation may not be in accordance with the constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládka, this is not a tax in this case, because the state pays for minerals, which are state property.
Fees are only granted to municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money of the municipality and a quarter of the state will be given.
The same will apply to the mining of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state collects from the mining fees will be purpose-bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The proposal was criticised by opposition MPs today, who argued in particular that it would harm mining-affected communities and regions.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the finance minister's budget," said David Kádner, elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
Hana Aulická, a member of the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M, warned against the rise of unemployment in Mostek.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed the novel to be rejected, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for revision.
The reasoning report states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not penetrate coal prices, as prices are contracted out of more than 90 percent in the long run.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heaters, should therefore not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it believes that the increase in employment fees is bearable.
According to the rapporteur on the Milan Urbana (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) novelty, it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and especially the government’s decision on the limits of coal mining even before the approval of the law.
If coal is extracted even beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the boundary at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fall only after 2020.
According to him, the limits on the <0xC4><0x8C>SA mine should be broken due to social, economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists contacted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for a while and keep interest rates in the range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get off the grid and start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been doing pretty well, recovering in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against this step.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
A gunman at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his Mississippi girlfriend on Monday — and later that day, his colleague — wrote a message saying he was “sorry” for the first murder and wishing he could take it back, government officials uncovered on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police around 10 a.m. on Monday morning.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send a police officer to his house.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “cute dog” in the house that “will not bother anyone” but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not present himself.
Lamb also did not explain why there was a shooting in the house.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb that read, “I’m so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who has ever loved me.”
After leaving a message, Lamb embarked on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
William LaForge, dean of the university, said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "something was obviously going on in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in a romantic relationship between Amy Prentiss and Schmidt, government officials said there was "no evidence" of a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was "shocked" by the incident.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss’ close friend, as reported by the Sun Herald, worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Flash, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She's always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he "won't go to jail."
When police caught him on a highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a biography he published on the school’s website, Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their magic
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was arrested for possession of drugs in 2008.
All of these things must be collecting their tax.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw will be out of the game for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left the injury in tears and dismissed him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Hector Moreno's ruthless operation in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV space.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day and then operated on in Manchester.
It’s terrible – a guy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he plays again this season.
Moreno was lucky not to get a red card and a penalty kick.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian arbitrator was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure for both legs.
The tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you to everyone for their messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins now and I will return even stronger."
Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injuries in a defeat against PSV
The English defender will have the added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It was a very ugly injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in the 2014 World Cup match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt his opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was not able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see the operation on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Does David Cameron know The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take long for it to learn to remember.
You can't be David Cameron.
Asked by the provider of children's schemes to name a favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a 1971 fairy tale by Dr Seuss.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report published on the SuperCamps website, and continues: “Funny, touching, creative and with strong content, I liked to read it to my children because behind it was always an image or message I had never seen before.”
Well, only then, in the next paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the story of the book according to the elevator from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill out the brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by a 1991 wall, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," says Drew, a short content of the book.
As if it weren't suspicious enough, the text provided by Cameron reads as a summary elevator of the film Lorax, which is found on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by the walls of its heart, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the breath of the air ceased to exist."
Since he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not have been acquainted with the story of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being devastated by a ruthless, tree-cutting industrialist, Once-ler, who despite the protests of the titled Lorax, a shy, whispered creature, "spoken behind us."
Most likely, such a relatively minor PR task was given to an assistant who had never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a piece.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron’s employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of omitting England, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England selected for this tour, I think it will be very unlikely to repeat the 3-0 defeat she suffered last time in the trial series.
Also, I would not directly exclude the win of the guests.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than that of three years ago, but there are good spin players in this stalking set and also collective thinking is strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, just the youthful positivity.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the trial series, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England in the season-experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is a hard nut for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in harsh conditions and a simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no question marks around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I’ve mentioned this before — players are their best selectors.
A few more half centuries and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Let’s hope that if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will arise.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not 100%, and that’s not surprising to me; he’s always been a team player.
The question of how much trial time a sticker gets to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and abroad.
The only thing that could make you rematch is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best shape — but this missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming and he's a batsman, which I rate very positively.
He is the x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 against us on Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all this will depend on the overall composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, has been put forward and I have no objection to it.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't fire, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He had succeeded for three centuries, and he did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a back-up spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, I was impressed as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats — an average of 31 with a stick and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a primitive, but there aren’t a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors opted for youth.
There’s a lot to learn on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made some changes and smart additions to their coaching staff.
Appointing Mahel Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match consultant can be a master move.
He is one of the most beautifully played guys who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood arrives as part of the white-ball tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and just like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the wardrobe, even though they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Collaborator Colly Durham Ben Stokes got a day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not make a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
The unthinkable strategy of renegotiating David Cameron to keep Britain in the EU is getting into further trouble every day without electing the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to head the Labour Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation to a standstill on Tuesday.
The aliens also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough of the British self-centered agenda, sharing concessions and disruptive treaty changes they mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they would not want to do so even if they were to deny social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without local officials, and then return home with the words that they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unbridled Britain in Europe – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don’t care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with too long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It’s hard to see them breaking their legs with the help of the Selfie Brits, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they themselves don’t want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan intentionally useless SNP-style remarks during the campaign ahead of the 2017 UK referendum to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"Renegotiating has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing worth negotiating."
Europeans know to their own detriment how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical they are of the EU’s press oligarch barons, because they weren’t during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They may remember the name of Boris Johnson, a sneaky Euro-opportunist who made his name as a Brussels-based reporter on EU straight bananas in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-free villains, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same of them, but he realized that when you’re in a cage with a furious gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so that she doesn’t put you out for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband has been more like Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron’s referendum routine since Blair accepted the principle of the repealed EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and given him a dismissal card.
The press never forgave him either.
But the dear Jeremy Corbyn, who friendlyly slapped me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he shouldn't waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of reapplying the Murdoch Neil Kinnock boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is evolving, I'll say it nicely.
He says he wants to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the furious tendency of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's Little Englanderism can certainly agree.
The same thing Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said on radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was the wrong decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his grandfather fought for his loyalty on television without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "at all costs" -- Bennin's phrase -- was apparently not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, it touched me - the discipline of news remains important in the age of all-day television broadcasting and especially in the faith, the hub of paranoia and betrayal that are social media.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take the support of the Workers’ Party in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental distortion of EU membership – in line with their Bennite surrounding economy, an anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an issue of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic haste.
As well as his crackdown on NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC's campaign won't want it to end - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand the meaning of it all for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on Britain's concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the brisk "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of the conservative government in power, as I was reminded of on Monday's launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize electronics review published by Public Health England
A government-funded statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in their report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE released a “beginning” report last month and described it as a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
However, several researchers questioned the scope of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet magazine last month attacked an "extraordinarily clumsy base" on which PHE based its main findings.
Two other experts writing for BMJ questioned the claim, which was allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They claim that the public might expect that the PHE’s claim, which sounds “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking,” is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criterion decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the outcomes of the negotiations were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly previously raised funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the public health credentials of BAT in the Sustainability Report, he said.
One of the 12 attendees admitted funding from the electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not funding he allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some other attendees at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
Tobacco management also participated in the meeting at PHE.
The report, which was produced in this group, "excusably admits," lacking "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the allegations at BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers die because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
The BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 CEO
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give the right hand" for hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, in complex broadcast times versus his rivals' biggest ratings show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had unsuccessfully tried to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I'm fighting with the idea that the BBC is putting on and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of a debate on the BBC's future.
If you maintain licensing fees that I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, at least for programs that others don’t produce or sell should be reduced.
They’re broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support in the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and, of course, domestically produced.
Honestly, other channels would give them the right hand.
I can't understand how these are public broadcasting services.
I don't think that would even weaken the BBC.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty for reaching ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows repeats those of former Sky CEO Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more sneaky BBC public service programs "move to BBC4, where quite often you can't measure the audience, but they're fulfilling their authority and they can argue when they're going on their hypocritical mission of justifying <0xC2><0xA3>4bn of revenue from licensing fees."
They broadcast them at a time when no one is watching them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the commission: “I challenge you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a big sum, but for people for whom <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot, I’d be surprised if they paid that much because they don’t watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who spoke before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reich mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that a small amount of BBC production was now previously classified as educational - it was 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take as a role model public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
Speaking about the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, which only a handful were broadcast on television, and connect with commercial reporters so we can see them all online.
"Sonogentics" or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the ticks move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny ticks change direction when they are affected by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists Can Read and Write Brain Activity Using Light
The researchers said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogentics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and is activated outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are inserted into the patient's brain.
The shells usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the worms’ bodies.
Amplified ultrasonic waves act in the ion channels of TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, according to a report from Nature Communications.
In order to control the ticks using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where the modified motor neurons turned on.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, made it clear that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements disappointing the British arms trade.
Take a look at Amnesty International’s anti-weapons market video.
Terrible killer drones!
Leg clamps that break the ankles!
Trivial missiles!
And electric stunners that cause unbearable pain, but leave no traces!
The cheerful voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no one in doubt that this ad at the world’s largest arms trade fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes via the defense and security facilities of the International Centre.

This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR...Customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
On 300 posters are created artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The Special Patrol Group has helped distribute it across London using the Ad Space Hack Packs, which is <0xC2><0xA3>6 per piece of Allen’s key, which is allegedly “gaining access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet.”
Transport for London is not entertained by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, a curator of Cruel Designs and a professional assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists switch to working with activists within the protest movement and realize that they need to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the posters against the arms trade is the health of passengers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video was watched by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by VCCP, an agency that works without a fee, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the ads about the arms trade - he saw an empty spot in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with creating more realistic risky corporate ads, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, we've managed to attract more people."
“They did a fantastic job of helping us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we now need is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab unveiled an order from the U.S. military for the "attacking arm of the AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a College
11 years ago, I moved to college as a careless nineteen-year-old boy, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but until now, I remember the tense smiles of those I hated — and the numerous, lengthy complaints of others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the track can range from mild to nerve-wracking to totally shocking.
It's tempting to gossip: to tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why "you honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from the yeast HAHA, I'll be at peace with you."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe, too - ask and show interest.
It drives the conversation and helps you find the people you love, and the ones you wouldn't be having fun with even if your eyelashes were on the same fire and they were releasing fire extinguishers.
Make room for people.
People’s rooms often change to drink receptions, movie night venues, and communal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and decorate their underwear.
RELATED: Don’t even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts will come to college.
Your room should be a haven, yet many tracks are transformed into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It could be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can return to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to find out when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write him a place to tap.
Speaking of clapping, tap.
One boy in my room used to be invited in unless the door was locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends through baking. Make friends through baking.
Because you started going to university on top of baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and the show with a sheet of baked cookies seems a little less odd, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile while I'm asking personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk to you and maybe everything will end up assigning your face to a tasty surprise.
This is of course the subject of you being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and pencil are likely to prevent others from pretending to be asleep when you try to knock on their door.
Food theft is a common crime on student campuses.
Stealing an entire chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There’s a chance they’ll offer you milk even if they’re angry inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate, who exchanged her milk for a dishwasher to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make sounds that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It’s not just about being a decent human being, you’re also famous people in glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could quiet down the drum and bass a little bit because it was 3 in the night and she had a note in the morning.
Their response was to strengthen the music.
When they finally calmed down at 5 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours and then left her own music out loud, locked the door and left on her three-hour note.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future daughter went to the same college as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn’t it be terribly embarrassing if you mistake your roommate for your future boyfriend, sleep with each other, break up and have to see each other every day, and maybe also take control of your shared friends?
Of course, you won’t order your heart – but if your sexy roommate isn’t 100% your future pet, at least try to talk a little bit with your weaknesses.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about securing them by hiding something from them - never brush someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and give them the keys to the water bottle, which you then put into the freezer - but never stick their stuff to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva looked forward to the twins despite her uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a difficult time getting pregnant with her seven-year-old daughter.
His father broke up with her, and for the preparation and upbringing of the offspring was alone.
I coped with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the baby and I was looking for a positive in it.
With uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to bother.
And I certainly had hopes that we won’t be alone for long, today Eva remembers her first pregnancy.
Already at that time she met on the Internet at the chat of the elder Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek, with whom they began to talk about their favorite movies.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek even brought Eva and Vítek home from the maternity ward, but he did not take too much into the role of his stepfather.
"He then retired from the program for a while," Eva said in the documentary series Four in Three.
The motive of the third series of the Czech television series is precisely the search for luck for the second attempt.
She managed to take care of Vítka and the financial security of her family thanks to part-time work and great help from her mother and her aunt.
Even the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child ultimately did not spoil Wax’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítk’s second birthday and he now understands Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek as his dad and also calls him that.
Although Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek already has two adult daughters, at the age of sixty he enjoys paternity and is also more devoted to children.
In addition to Vítka, a two-year-old Leontynka and eventually twins joined them.
“Your family came into our family in a way that was natural, perhaps because my mother never spoke to me very much,” Eva smiles.
A little space?
At least we're close.
The twins Ema and Ela were born by cesarean section after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disturbance in the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excess in the blood of pregnant women and are manifested especially by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually spontaneously disappears.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evina and Wax’s happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emi<0xC4><0x8D>ka was placed in an incubator in an intermediate department, where Vaskova’s niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer from JIP to the room I had her with me, she describes the difficult period after giving birth to Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until the doctors agreed to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilograms.
Waiting for the baby to be born in Eve's maternity ward did not make me happy.
"I was mad at my husband and children," recalls a six-year-old four-time mother.
She and her husband also considered signing the reverse, among other things because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
Eventually, however, the doctors released Eve and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births broadcast by <0xC4><0x8C>T1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
A large family can be humbled.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with the electric duplex and the tight conditions.
Although the house did not grow, Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek made Eva happy by mounting a gas cooker to make preparation of meals for six people more comfortable.
When it gets worse, we'll switch to a taxi.
Eva is convinced that children especially perceive family comfort and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or disillusionment of the cottage.
So far, we've been doing very well, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes overwhelm the waving baby, but at least we are all close, Eva smiles, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Wax’s work as an illuminator for the film is not a guarantee of regular reception.
This is why he sometimes goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his sixties, he says that he physically manages the finances of the family and children, but how long will it be?
"I realize that because of our age difference, one day it will be me who will feed this family," Eva admits on the level when asking about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly terno for employers.
And when it gets worse, my husband and I can switch taxis, a cute blonde joke.
Apple has a yo-yo effect.
The displays are responsible for everything.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a firmer chassis or a touch-recognising display are, in short, the advantages of the newly introduced ninth generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s current trend is that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exceptions were only the third and fourth generations, whose weight has slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram difference in weight to the detriment of the news was indeed negligible.
However, this is far from true for new iPhones.
Compared to last year’s iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for a smaller model, and by 20 grams for a larger one.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year’s affair with bending in Apple’s pockets has greatly deteriorated.
The chassis of the novelty is thus made of more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which also reflected on the weight.
But the displays have a much greater impact on it.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology to help the displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, it was necessary to provide the display with another layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the displays of the new iPhones has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For the smaller iPhone from 12 grams to 29 grams, for the larger ones from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component.
The weight of only 143 grams is achieved in this novelty thanks to the degreasing bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, it is the heaviest used element of the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessors.
Even in this case, the biggest increase can be seen in the display.
The 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus weighs 192 grams.
To what extent the new display technology will be practical, it will only manifest itself when used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday, September 25, when sales of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will begin in selected countries.
Have the breakfast flakes been champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have managed to find something that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern humans from different eras, including murals, remnants of tools and so on and so forth.
In layer 23A, which according to the tools is dated to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that is very reminiscent of the remains of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oat grains were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of production of so popular flakes today.
With it, the grains are first soaked today, then dried, get rid of the packaging, so-called fluff, then boil and squeeze flat.
In the Paglicci cave, grains were apparently heated or burned, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this is indicated by the traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, the scientists could not prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that the entire process of production of flakes would take place in the cave, but the similarity is really very noticeable.
We also have no evidence of how people might have eaten flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly even warmth is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting evidence of how intensively people used cereals long before the beginning of agriculture.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have surpassed agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New reporting stations in the Transport Enterprise of the City of Brno.
So once again I listened to the reports of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Hnusá<0xC4><0x8D>kova, Phantom, Frázova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so the male-voiced message was a bit less understandable than before when the stops were reported by the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is better discernible than the deeper male voice.
While the DPMB argues that this speaker was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings taken in absolute silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for a good few decades, so I remember the correct names of all those stops, so I do not need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere, who do not know themselves in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, can be confused and can argue in the final, then omitted, where
Perhaps the choice of the speaker - but better yet the speakers - should be made again, and this time underscored by the usual traffic noise and buzzing of the engine, in which the whistle of the speaker in the bus almost disappears.
So that we do not have to listen to the names of the stations Water Her<0xC5><0xA1>pice, <0xC5><0xA0>mírova, or Submersible in the crunchy dish, to which I moved in Komárov.
I guess my old hearing didn't get so bad all of a sudden during the only day the speaker stop changed.
Before that day, I understood these reports quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the tracker's notes.
Today, few people know which of the parties’ governments were the largest and smartest, the so-called comprehensive checks.
I allowed myself to remember it.
The bus was late.
I walked into the dispatcher's office as soon as the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't have a fight with a fellow chief, he came a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher said as I entered the Arrivals Book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I'm driving through the districts for a little mechanization review.
It's not going to work, there's checks today.
They're all so fucked up, all so horrified.
What's the matter?
"You'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next time, you'll be too.
I ran into the hallway.
Then the door of the chief's office opened, and the chief appeared.
Tight, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted respectfully, and quickly turned on the two buttons of the uniform jacket.
"Good morning," said the reply, and I quickly ran out to the second floor without realizing the cold, sinister tone to which the old man replied.
"You're playing," said engineer Eva, an old lady whom I admired very much.
She was even the chief of staff before her comrades deposed her.
There's checks, and you're gonna be there.
How many times have I asked what these complex checkups are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they do it once every three years, everyone has to go to them, and it's quite uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I think I'll see.
I pulled out a folder with periodic reports and then a phone.
"Here Holcman, come to me right away," the chief's voice said.
What's bothering you?
Now we met and nothing..." I mumbled, but no one answered me, each with his own thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I have come upon your orders," I muttered, barely entering the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at the desk, looking through some campground.
"Comrade mechanizer," he said for a moment, without raising his head, and still looking at the camp carefully, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the canvas on the table, leaned against the back of the chair, and stared at me with an ordinary, unpleasant, evil, fluffy look.
I'm unsure.
Hey, what's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised that I worked very well in those few months in office and that he was very satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
Realize that you are a track distance technician and you have to behave accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I said that I have used such a greeting since I was a child, that I was so educated and that I see nothing wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red turkey cloth.
"You're on the socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," said the swift chief.
Plus, you're still messing with superiors.
One time you say "sir" and the second time you say "comrade."
But I'm not a Mr. Chief for you, I'm a fellow Chief.
The deputies are the comrades of the deputies, the top tracks are the comrades of the top tracks!
Remember that kindly!
Excuse me, sir... comrade chief, but... but I greeted you with a common civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's the honor of the job, or the comrade... you know... I'm not on the party...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the side," said the chief coldly, who had calmed down a bit in the meantime.
But there will still be talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a retirement prepaid chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his preference, it didn't look good with the person in question.
For a moment, he stabbed me with a cold, stiff look, and I looked for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his elevated ticking.
He was only a few years older and he was playing god, actually god mate.
Jovial, puffy, authoritarian, arrogant, how it fits him right now.
Everyone yelled at him.
Well, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the partisan organization, like all the partisans, but also the non-partisans, tricked him.
But the chief touched many, especially those to whom he could have exercised his superiority.
Right now, he shot me for complete nonsense.
I thought something about fucking and it cost me enough to beat him up so I didn't shoot him in the face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the crumb strike, let alone continue to be a railroad official.
What would I eat for two kids?
And then there's the built-up mansion!
I was in tears, but I took control.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief finished the audience, and began to look at the camp carefully again, which he had in his hand before.
At midnight I was summoned.
Everyone in the office was already there, and when asked what and how, they said yes, it would be fine.
Only Jo<0xC5><0xBE>in bitingly stated, as it used to be his custom, that we cannot all be thrown out, because the work would have to be done by the comrade chief himself with his faithful, and that there is no danger.
The word "comrade" underscored, as if he knew what the old man shot me for this morning.
There was a nice gathering in the chief's office.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long advisory table other comrades who should have decided on my official being or not being.
Kádrovák, chairman of the ROH, staff recorder, special purpose reporter, a way of counterattack on the war, and deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the partnership organization.
I knew him from the strike.
Ordinary track worker, conquering barges or throwing gravel with forks.
But also a former guardian.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him at the time, said to be a pretty beast.
Bad languages claimed that he went out of school in seventh grade, didn’t learn anything, didn’t know anything.
And when the criminal was cancelled, he ended up on a sledgehammer at the croupier's.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little soul inside me, an unfathomable toe in my throat.
Kádrovák read the opinion of the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I am married, I have two children and so on and so on.
So far, it's good, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
Then the opinion of the street organization of the party.
He copied the opinion of the civic committee, maybe both were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of the longtime party members refused to appear before the inspection committee and subsequently left the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The clerk noticed and stopped reading.
The chief ordered him to go on.
It's just gotten worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee and there I was recruited as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who stepped out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and I had a wedding in the church in addition to the National Committee.
I let the party's confidence down in the worst way.
That's why I've been cut off from her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, had a church funeral, even though she was a former member of the party.
All this shows a negative attitude towards the leadership role of the party.
When the framer finished reading, only the knocking of the chief's pencil into the tabletop interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wish I was somewhere far away.
In the meantime, I kept repeating in my mind, "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans."
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could fix the folds without some fucking checkup.
But now?
She took on the career of a railroad official before she started.
Back to the squad?
I don't think that's going to work. I'm sure the chief's gonna take me out for an hour.
"Comrade, how have you examined the comrade in question?" the chief interrupted the tense silence with a question to the clerk.
Well, according to the assessment from the previous job.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, it wasn’t over twice.
On the corners of the sweat drop, he blinked nervously, as if he had been examined.
He nodded zealously and handed some paper to the chief.
"No," said the chief, with a hint of wildness, which was often the foreword of the storm.
At first glance, the praise itself, taught with honors, studied industrialism, worked in the task wage as a locksmith, met the norm on average at one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where did you get that judgment, comrade?" he turned again to the clerk, who felt that it was beginning to turn against him, and that he would not even have to be a clerk very soon.
This is where my comrade gave it to me on board.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the platoon," the clerk whispered.
And there are no testimonials required, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you put it into a technical function, this paper cart is enough for you," Drought said.
The cameraman blinked nervously and had no answer.
"It doesn't matter, we'll talk about it later," the chief concluded, and the staff member was apparently relieved.
It's stable for now.
"What about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden he's yelling at me, so it's over!
It was dark in my eyes, it was hot.
A flood of regrets and accusations followed, and I knew that I was the most repugnant creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest pity.
That by substantiating the incomplete assessment I misled the co-reporter of the staff, not understanding why the assessment was incomplete when I received it from the staff member at the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist being who, at the time of the construction of real socialism, promotes the breeding of religious darkness, and even participates in it.
That, that, there was a lot of everything I've done, or maybe I'm still doing, and I quietly prayed for it to end.
I didn't care about anything.
I didn't care if I was flying out of the mechanic's seat.
I didn't care if they took the potato from me.
This is work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people as I was in the eyes of the comrade of the chief.
"That would be enough, comrade chief," the party's leader suddenly said, sharply interrupting the chief Levites.
Here the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, it was stupid!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side for a while!
In order to open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The untrained keeper spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so summed up or parrot phrases from part-time training and meetings?
That is why this young fellow must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who is to give it to him, if not you, comrade chief?
It is your duty, indeed, this young, somewhat misguided comrade, to support his efforts for redress!
It's your party duty that no one's going to take away from you!
In fact, it is a party duty for all of us.
Here the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother he not only punishes, but that he also loves.
When the president came out, no one was talking.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade President," the chief said, frowning, in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me make a deal, you'd hear that's the conclusion I was coming to.
They all nodded their heads, but it was clear to them that they did not believe him.
"So I was confirmed to be a stand-alone caregiver," I covered on my way back to the office, and then I cried.
Thankfully, except for Eva's engineer, everyone was at lunch.
She quietly listened to my inconsistent narrative of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked if I could have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she placed the water on the stove and prepared the pots.
In the meantime, she talked about HR practices.
How one judgment, often full of praise, they give to a man in his hand, and the other, in which there is some dirt, they send to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to be, but on a straw at the crockery, so the factory comrades didn't know where to send it.
What about our framer?
He only cares where he eats or drinks, and so it ends up as it ends up.
"He's got it from the old man," she remarked viciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Be careful of him anyway, he's pretty vengeful.
And the part-time president?
Basically a far worse chief, no people.
Zero from a crumbler with great power.
The water on the coffee began to boil, and then the office was filled with the scent of just spilled coffee.
I poured a cube of sugar into a bowl and silently stirred the hot liquor.
Maybe I'm from the worst out there.
I'm not gonna be fired now, and I'm not gonna be able to get any more checks in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief, he's not gonna forget about me today.

The symbol of the town came to life.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlume turns again after years.
It can be seen from a distance, because it is located on a fifteen-metre high cone.
People from all over the world call him the "Wind on the Chlum."
For the village with 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal symbol that the village received on the occasion of the meeting of natives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at the time and of course we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone in the area knows it," said Mayor Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The Clumsy Wind Pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a reminder of the present day: it is reminiscent of a time when people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It wasn’t until 1910 that the clumsy representatives decided on a solution that was then suitable until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch on Chichov they had a seven-metre deep well dug.
Three years later, the well was supplemented by a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the church here.
"The construction was carried out by the company Antonín Kunc from Hranic in Moravia at a cost of 2,400 crowns," says the memorial inscription on the ground fence of the construction of the mast.
The pump after several repairs and wind turbine fell in service in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the struggle for water began to be written: on that day a new pipeline began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump is now only a non-functional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
The Dominant was put into operation at this year's meeting of natives.
It was only in 2008 that the Chlum<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> decided to repair the wind wheel again and put it back into operation.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced in diameter by half a meter.
The wheel was placed on a pole, but it had to be lifted down the same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel was not able to resist the thrusts of the wind.
Then the domineering chick rested for several years undressed under the roof.
However, since June this year, the wheel on the high pole is spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the village had the replica of the wheel adjusted and again placed it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws useful water from the well only into the attacking blind shoulder.
And during the summer we completely disconnected it, because there was little water in the well.
At least it was empty.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the shaft of the wind wheel from the pump in the sack basket again," explained Mayor Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where a wind bike has been placed in the municipal sign, but it is the only one of its kind in the entire Highlands.
They have a similar element in the sign in honor of local technical monuments, for example, in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsk, in Ku<0xC5><0xBE>elov in Hodonínsk, in Partutovice in P<0xC5><0x99>erovsk or in Police in Vsetínsk.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafat, confessed the support of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career," Goian, 34, smiled at the pre-match press conference.
We were coached by George Hagi at the time, it was a pity that we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta.
The only difference is that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 games for the Romanian national team, is the key supporter of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the assaults of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Spartan Hyb<0xC5><0xA1> about the Greek fight.
He wonders what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know Fataie well, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all of their matches.
I know he’s a very good striker, so he went to Sparta too, Goian said.
He did not name any other players of the Prague club, so a direct question arose whether he also knew David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and looked at Czech journalists with a slightly accusing gaze.
The blunt expression on his face meant, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he let go.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot in the team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know this very well about Goian.
"He has experience from larger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is such an organizer of the game," said Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has had the best years of his life, but he can boast of a very interesting football CV.
In his time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City were interested in him, but from Steaua he went to Palermo, Italy, and played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European cups, washed away for victory in the Czech league.
He’s a favorite for me in this match, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am at peace with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD>, who is very much looking forward to the Czech rival.
Yeah, me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should be Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading in shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the group’s headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far as part of the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a de facto impact on the events in the company, says Daniel Bury<0xC5><0xA1>, financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's headquarters, the shareholders are considering placing the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is completing a securities prospectus, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding company’s registered office and related transfers of shares will take the form of a non-public transaction with only existing shareholders participating.
As a result, no shares will be offered to the public or new investors under this operation.
"An eventual offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - at a later date, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that a possible offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of Objectivity of Czech Television in Information on the Migrant Crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the news of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time broadcasting the main news session of Czech Television.
How did she stand?
Once they teach journalists at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can start broadcasting today on Czech TV Events.
About 80% of the news broadcast was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Only at the first minute, when the <0xC4><0x8C>T reported about the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police officers, they were euphemistically run out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already there - judge for yourself the names of the individual reporters.
Criticism of NGOs - a big space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian Children in the Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Refugee Travel - <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses the terms refugee and not migrant.
What is most striking is that <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses only images for young children and women in illustrations.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Abstract: For the most part, propaganda that is unparalleled from communist agitators.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
Once upon a time, when I grew up in a panel apartment, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
I've been moving fishes to an ummakart toilet.
Domestic fishes, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not gaining that transition from a caterpillar to a bug and a young, look like an adult individual, are only tiny and gradually grow.
They were disgusting to me and I didn't want to lose them.
First by hand and then chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or some other way?
However, it was successfully eliminated.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in the same way.
A box with some kind of juvenilizer that the ants brought into their nest and then he did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I turned it around.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to the view that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from my life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and can replace one pest with another.
The truth about fleas and puppies is that I wouldn't hesitate to make my karma worse by killing them.
In the new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fish don’t climb up our necks, let them eat peeled skin, some invisible eyelashes and so on in peace.
Their peaceful existence was interrupted by a spider after a while.
It was a common type of penitent who had long lived on the ceiling.
We thought it lived on occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he lived with us for several years, we found that he mainly feeds on fish and that their number seems to have kept in a bearable state of numbers.
We have found that it is a female, through confidential regular contact with every need we have made.
We witnessed romantic intrigues with a partner about a third less, as he gently crawls on the fibers of the spider web, so that he is not eaten before he reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days for them not to move and not respond to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love plays took place, we later found the remains of the dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
Some of them were eaten by their mother, some of them were scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, a little bit smaller, probably the daughter of that inhabitant of the toilet.
For some time, from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behavior, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she evaluated our non-attack as friendship.
The number of the somewhat multiplied fish declined again, and the spider watched his usual activities to provide food in peace.
Our ecosystem hasn’t changed all year.
Our daughter grew up in the middle of that, when the use of a nightgown was already a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal spilling of its contents has already fed us.
We urged her more and more strongly to use the toilet.
But the daughter found an excuse for her bad habit in the spider, which she saw very well when she wiped.
Our talk of seeing a spider didn't take the luck in the house at all.
With tears and screams, she forced her nightgown.
There wasn't any leftovers.
There came a time when the spider had to command, in the interests of the daughter's developmental shift.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and driven through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but after such a long cohabitation, I still felt disgusted as if I was firing a relative.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and begin to multiply in a geometric order.
The world wondered, a week or two, no one showed up there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the ant-like spider had somehow cultivated them, that the toilet environment wasn't as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were already crowded again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I came to the conclusion that their attachment to the spider must have been due to the fact that when they do not see it, it is hidden somewhere else and they are in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection to their predator, and its rapid disappearance in them caused some alarming reaction.
The more so, I don't make any illusions about their eyesight.
They showed some light flattery, but that they would respond to shake hands or quick movements, they did not.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the nightgown.
All we have to do is attract another spider.
I'm already sending my wishes to the air, and I hope they didn't hate me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use Cyclone B.
Albert Einstein’s Ten Proposals That Enriched the World
The words of a brilliant scientist from the last century seem to never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to immerse himself in everything so deeply that the result was always astonishing findings.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
He first and foremost came into human consciousness with his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic proportion.
Nor can it be overlooked its clarification of the photo effect or the idea of quantizing an electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description and knowledge system of the popular theory of relativity is so intricate for many that they prefer to choose easy models for closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
But it would not have been Albert Einstein, had he not found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: A clock near your beloved seems to be a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems to be an hour – and that is relativity.
I allowed myself to choose from his entire pleiades of famous quotes these ten, which literally fascinated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
However, the only one can prove that I was wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the disorder on the table is a reflection of the disorder in the mind, then what does the empty table reflect?
I don't know what he's going to fight in World War III, but in World War IV, it's going to be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but none to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous, and knowing much too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem on which my life would depend, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive myself for not defining Einstein’s formula for success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is holding your tongue to your teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín region expect changes of 1.5 billion.
"It's a success when we consider that all four of them are holding on to the black numbers this year," said hetman Stanislav Misak.
The total profit of regional facilities is currently about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after years of poverty, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>, Vsetín, Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> and Zlín, construction costs nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period when we were buying mainly appliances is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them the state-of-the-art health care can not be done, said Lubomír Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, Regional Deputy for Healthcare.
Changes are expected in all hospitals.
Builders will be in hospitals next year.
In Vsetín they are now selecting suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE> they have a planned addition of dialysis.
Hungary’s Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> wants to build a new internship for about $200 million for the central pavilion that is open this year.
And Zlín Batá Hospital is awaiting the long-delayed construction of a new central income and an internship, which will require three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Prousková, director of the hospital, said, for example, about the construction of the V<0xC5><0xA1>etín internship.
The five-storey building is expected to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable facilities for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and an intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which are widely known to patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, on the floor they need only one toilet, the beds are unlockable, the windows are leaky and the health care workers do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our internship was built thirty-five years ago and now it is on the verge of its shelf life," said Pavel Calabek, director of the Zlín hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to an emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will thus have all the acute departments in one place, in addition to new spaces.
The same model already has a half-finished Hungarian Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
The central income is already there, and the internal income will be added to it within three years.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own resources," explained Director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the region.
The profit is still the highest and the loss was not even two years ago, when, for example, the Zlín hospital faced a loss of almost two hundred million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who manages the economy.
Improvements will also be expected for patients from the Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE> hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new appliances and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the interception station will be completed, then the addition of dialysis will begin, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance imaging.

No one has explained to me how I should keep the refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) complains after talks with his European counterparts that the other Czech states are pushing for the acceptance of quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they refuse any discussion.
He also points out that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic, if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not receive an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you have taken at the meeting of the EU Ministers of Interior and Foreign Affairs?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot speak of migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are heading somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to sustain migrants on the territory of the Member States if they are redistributed.
We can't imagine it.
We did not receive an answer and therefore we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about it for a year and we say this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Recently we dealt with forty thousand, now it is one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their target country, have ambitions to come to us, but the interest of the people from this migration wave, that is from Syria and other countries, is marginally close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't really want to come to us, but we've already committed fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn't it be possible to take more of them this way?
We are committed to accepting 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even those 1,500 are going to be 1,100 people with whom we're going to deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we did the ones we caught.
It is a big question, and we will be debating this with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and in Greece, or possibly in Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement, which is not yet, it may happen that even those 1100 will not be kept in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to that Germany when they arrive.
If we are able to detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will arrange an asylum procedure with them.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent according to European statistics are getting international protection.
Then they will receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will relocate.
This is the second project that is going on so far, and we have only progressed there by debating with the churches about the possibility that they could help them get jobs, accommodation and so on.
But it's a run on a very long track.
You said that other states were not willing to discuss the ministerial talks with us.
Isn’t it that the Czech Republic simply rejects quotas, but does not offer any solidarity step that would unblock the discussion?
What kind of solidarity do you think would be?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can go to them, then the news spreads within hours across all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders – simply dissuade those migratory waves, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Clearly to show them that they have no chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovans came to Germany last year alone.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's offices.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, then the fifty percent of what the social systems spend on them today could be spent on refugees.
Compared to the first day Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it is eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How long will it take for border controls to be tightened?
We were afraid of being caught in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it as standard.
The Austrians are the only ones who take those people from us, with Hungary it is complicated and the Greeks - it is a completely useless story.
Where is the breaking point?
Should it be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days in a row, will exhaust our capacities enough to start emergency plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an emergency government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in phone contact several times a day.
If this situation were to occur, the government could sit de facto immediately and by one resolution would decide to strengthen the police over the army, let's give it the customs administration, or possibly the prison service.
Is the extreme variant the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think we can get this far.
Please note that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we only have the Schengen border at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarming information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, rather, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct journey to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debt at the last minute.
They are trying to prevent bankruptcy.
Slavia has paid off her debts.
Footballers were also looking forward to their money.
Footballer Slavia stood for the first time on Tuesday due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after the proposal was filed by Online Services of Pacific Samoa for about 20 million crowns.
Lawyer Slavia Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlova within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it must be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week with the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC5><0xA0>imán<0xC4><0x9B>.
Apparently, the money came from the new owners to the club at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the Przysztof club on Monday, just the day before the court hearing, sent in debt tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15," said Lawyer Slavia Mládková.
Whom did Slavia pay?
To current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivanov or the Czech supporter Maria Li<0xC4><0x8D>kova.
Slavia also paid the fee to agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club also paid the indebted fees of the Prague 10 district.
Thus, de facto only claims that Slavia contradicts remain part of the insolvency dispute.
According to the club, the commitments did not arise at all, or they are subject to legal disputes.
However, we are prepared to pay amounts in case of loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove by an extract from the account," Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that came after the due date has been paid," Mládková said, adding that only invalid or contradictory commitments were not paid.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed proof that she had actually paid off the debts mentioned.
Subsequently, all evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected at the earliest in November.
The judge ordered the proceedings to be resumed on November 3.
However, the decision will not be taken at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of state-of-the-art technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular design brings benefits and a fast return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
From welding structural steel to welding special alloys, as well as from welding coarse materials to welding thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple setup and extensibility of the welding source allow you to react quickly to changing requirements, leading to reduced downtime, the need to switch the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with state-of-the-art welding processes developed by Kemppi to ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
It stops wasting time and there is no waste of material or repair of faulty welds.
Flexibility is ensured, less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It is a novelty this year, which had its premiere in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate this honor, as it confirms the uniqueness of the product.
The world’s leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but due to the differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is among the world’s top.
For those interested, the delivery periods are certainly pleasant, which range around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will be expanded after the Brno Fair.
We have been his regular participants for over twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before him, says Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi’s Pilsen store.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
The blank could be built in such a way that it would not collapse.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
It was even safer, the expert said.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there would be no two landslides in Stromovca, Prague, says the production director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
He said it on Wednesday afternoon at a press tour of the tunnel.
It would be about half a billion kronor more expensive, he said.
It will open to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It is always a compromise between price and safety.
"The tunnel was safer, but the costs are increasing exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Baumovka were the same all the time, yet the land fell just a few steps away from where it began to emerge with a safer and more careful method.
"If these measures were applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The Blanka Tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was formed in Stromovka, in 2010 the soil collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of the company Metrostav Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the Euro weekly.
The construction was originally planned to cost 17 billion crowns.
If we add that to the VAT, which jumped twice during the construction period, you have twenty-one out of seventeen billion.
When you add technology, land purchases and engineering, valuations and the like, it's 29 billion, which isn't that far from the 37, B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to Get a New iPhone Operating System with New Apple Update
A new operating system may be required in Settings when you click on the "General" tab and select "Software Update".
When it’s ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and then install it.
Some users encountered a problem after the installation, namely the error message "software update failed".
One solution to this problem is to wait until the interest in the update decreases, or to try it through iTunes.
The phone will guide you through the update process.
And this includes the need to uninstall the application to free up space - but this will not be necessary, as Apple has reduced the update and also made the entire process easier by using a special tool that will design the user's application to delete and reinstall after the update is over.
Make sure your phone is charged before you start the update.
If the battery is low, Apple won't allow the update to run because interruption of the process could cause an update error.
Other news: iOS 9 has not been postponed despite WatchOS delays; iOS 9 review: an exciting update to the new version of the operating system; iOS9: how to prepare for the release of the new operating system for iPhone

FedEx’s mixed profits, fiscal outlook cut for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results for the past quarter and a huge reduction in its year-round profit forecast due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
Last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-trading 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average interest rate hike of 4.9 percent, which will show up in January, and higher surcharges for the ground transportation of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth from the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, chairman and CEO of the company, said that the company "led a solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced the day after rival UPS said it plans to hire an additional 90,000 to 95,000 workers, which is about the same as it did last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenues rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a drop in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenues in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has strengthened FedEx’s ground unit performance.
In the last quarter, land revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while profit fell in the freight trade due to higher labor prices.
In pre-trade trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx’s shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They finished Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent per year and 17 percent under the June 11 record.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at the 27-foot-long Honduras mahogany table, deciding whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Standing above them at one end of the central bank ornament, a two-storey meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to kick-start when pulled out of an unprecedented stimulus in the form of nearly zero short-term interest rates in place in 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed into adding to volatility by raising its benchmark federal funds rate — by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“It’s clear that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient reason to keep waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently interviewed by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises rates only if politicians soften the decline by promising that the next rise is in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was launched by expecting Fed policymakers to keep rates quiet this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the Fed raises rates now,” he said.
If they did, they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold the financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on its way to raising the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects rates to rise this year through spring and early summer despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market saw solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Salary gains showed signs of upswing.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed policymakers claim that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to tumble at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 16% below its record value in May, when investors feared China’s slowing economy would pull down global growth.
The market bounced somewhat this month and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of its May peak.
The turbulent situation in the market gives the Fed a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising the interest rate.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and reports of weaknesses in the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have hardly any data they could rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The state of health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main interests, so it should not be technically included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere indication by then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “squeeze” their monetary expansion in the market has triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that “the Fed has a history of exaggerated movements in financial markets that seem inconsistent with economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the policy making committee of the Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for higher rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The Asian financial crisis led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point during three sessions “despite limited identifiable impacts on growth in the US,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prioritize concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England.
The latest upheaval is not even approaching this level, he said.
“You certainly don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because markets have become angry,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinese Quarter.
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The Market / Warehouse is the only point of contact that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car part if you need some engine oil.
The shop is massive and it will take you over an hour to cross all the alleys.
If you’re hungry for all this shopping, go for a meal at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The in-house booth (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and lots of items are sold in bulk.
Among the fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The expansion of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash you and bake, even fry it for you, if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to the massive freezing section, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, free-market semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as single families and individuals.
Wide alleys meet shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the treasury stand.
Where it is located: The shop is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own car park, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the shop can be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways stays the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum permissible speed up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
This was decided by the House on Tuesday when it agreed to an amendment by the Senate, which rejected the increase in speed.
The ground transportation bill will now go to the president.
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman said at the end of April that a law allowing a 100-kilometre speed would veto.
Against the increase was also the Minister of Transport Dan <0xC5><0xA2>ok (for ANO), according to which the Czech highway network is not yet built at such a speed.
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives voted in favour of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, to increase speeds from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-speed roads.
The House initially extended this option to motorways, which could be driven in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
MEPs have now agreed on his proposal.
With the consent of the Minister of Transport, the senators also waived the authority of the Transport Police to have the last word when modifying the local roads, which are taken care of by the municipalities.
The Senate version, approved by the House, also envisages that sewage, plumbing or public lighting cables can be stored longitudinally under the surface of the roadways.
The towns would save money on land purchases.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the land in question.
The novelty is also intended to help improve road safety and make it easier for municipalities to handle towed vehicles that owners do not sign up to.
New municipalities could sell withdrawn vehicles, for which their owners will not notify within six months after notification of the withdrawal.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight through their territory on second and third class roads under the threat of fines even for shipping companies.
The novel also eliminates the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of the existing paper ones, which will continue to be used after January 1 next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
U<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>k<0xC4><0x9B> expressor goes to court.
He's in danger of 10 years for overpriced citizens' welcome.
The case relates to the allegedly overpriced project Welcome Citizens.
The police wanted to prosecute MP Zuzan Kailová (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The main event is scheduled for two days in October.
According to prosecutor Mandík and Macík caused damage of at least one million crowns, according to the indictment.
The applicant shall rely on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, the former members of the city’s management unjustly enabled them to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the reception of citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered the then head of the Magistrate’s Department of Urban Services, Education and Culture to address five linked companies in the tender.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, the city council canceled the competition.
The city was then to entrust the contract to the administrator, and only Darothore, who was then awarded the contract by the city council, entered into the competition.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges aimed at ensuring that Darothore was awarded a public procurement contract to host the Citizens’ Welcome event in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem for a long time and acted in a coordinated manner at least contrary to the requirement for proper economic care, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, they were aware that after obtaining this contract, Darothore subsequently invoices <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem for the implementation of the Citizens’ Welcome event a price that will be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company has collected more than five million crowns for the project, according to the file.
The city eventually paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, and then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was at least one million kronor overpriced.
Mandyk has already rejected any violations of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this constructed case, the former mayor said earlier, saying that the city under his leadership was only following a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was hosted by Roxy II.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money," Mandík added.
The criminalists originally wanted to indict Kaila, who was also a member of the city council.
The House of Representatives did not prosecute her.
The criminalists have therefore postponed the case in her case, but they expect to charge Kaila after her parliamentary term ends.
Welcoming citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns to buy children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police have reportedly released a dog to a refugee.
Then they forced the reporters to delete the record.
The Hungarian police reportedly briefly detained an AP cameraman on the Serbian border and forced him to delete the footage on which the police dog allegedly crashed into the refugee’s land.
The Hungarian government, however, has questioned this allegation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border with Serbia through a cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
The police took action against the refugees and one of them had a dog attack a Syrian with a basket on his shoulder.
The dog of the man who shouted, "Please, please, I am a refugee," fell, Muzi said.
The fact that Muzi filmed everything, one of the police officers noticed and did not let him leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Police took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration centre and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days of work in Serbia and Hungary.
He said he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a letter of protest to the Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the police’s behavior unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover up the events without risking physical violence and without fearing the government would destroy the legally obtained material.
Kovács questioned Muzi's narrative with reference to the police report.
He said the police just wanted a reporter to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to do anything.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to deter and chase a little bit of fear, but they certainly didn't attack," Kovács says.
The unpredictable Champions League.
Winning at City will kick us, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, coach of the City.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic match of the Champions League.
Not a single team has created a lot of opportunities, but the ball on the kickers we had had longer.
"The reason for the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team scored in a 636-minute match.
Last season's finalist Juventus was exactly the opposite before the match - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, the defender of the title has only one point and with a score of 2:4 is only in the 16th place of the table.
The return to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us," says coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supporters - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal before the new year.
In Manchester, Pogba, Mand<0xC5><0xBE>uki<0xC4><0x8D> and Morata were represented.
"That's right, this victory is very important, maybe because of it we'll get on the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attacking stage.
This is the result that my players deserve.
"We could have scored 0-2 before our goal, but Gianluigi supported us," Buffon praised Allegri's coach.
"We've burned a few good odds," said Yayu Touré, City's backer.
We have to take experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye Angelo, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we move on to the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that all the media bullshit around it is driven by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today, newspapers and media are full of babies carrying their parents on the dusty paths of the exodus.
And this automatically evokes a sense of guilt and compassion in a person - that is, in a European person.
Well, they do not come here only desperate babies, notice in the pictures of landing boats to the Greek islands that the baby is not so much to see on them!
Well, somehow we've been missing from television recently pictures of ships heading to Lampedusa, refugees off the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenades are home to thousands of young men.
Most of the young blacks.
And there's also pictures from Callais where these people are eating, and black men are waiting to get through the tunnel under the Manche.
I don't think he cares anymore.
Even those images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not in any way make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
Too much of a fake.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, somehow it is hidden that they are not only unhappy children from Syria, but also elegance - for the elderly: fashionably dressed - young men.
Their muscles look like they just came out of some kind of fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite the fact that it was private, suddenly a large group of cars came to the beach.
But no ham.
And young blacks came out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They entered the beach, all dressed in branded clothes and shoes. In their hands, as usual, smartphones.
They didn’t care that it was a private beach, and the staff – Turks, Muslims! – were obviously afraid of them.
They occupy all the deckchairs.
Those who did not lie on it and were right in the sea had bad luck.
They were dressed like American rapper movies.
On the heads of caps with nail, white and colored sneakers on the legs.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started eating.
They filled the tables around, piled up next to the sitting brown and white guests of the bar – reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers with children fled from the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
Incoming black men drank beer straight out of the thirds - as in the US series?! - they threw empty bottles around themselves on the beach.
They kept screaming loudly at each other.
But it wasn't English.
Then they drank wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in branded swimsuits, especially those young ladies -, screamed and screamed in the water, the mothers with the children and the pensioners fled terrified, and in half an hour there was not a single non-black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
Regardless of whether you are a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about it.
The waiter said to me in a half-voiced voice, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive cross of gold about twenty centimeters on his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"These are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw them sipping," the waiter replied.
They don't smuggle or use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important to me.
I didn't know what would happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known it first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants came to Europe at the time.
And they went and they went and they went.
Today, it turned out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-politically-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and lobbyist and economically important groups tied to them, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now-publicly recognized major power in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, but also the top EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic reception of refugees in Germany are on the level of images of Moscow television from August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunbathers at the station, but most of all - the Old Germans - Muslims welcomed their compatriots.
For long weeks, they were gossiping in the news on Czech TV, as according to some research, Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
However, those who have been in Germany for a few days know that it is a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organized by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Law Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, a week ago more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees.
This is also reported by our television.
However, they concealed what broke out the next day in Germany: that in the poll voting for the article it was found that 94.5% of Germans no longer want any immigrants - the poll was attended by 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly declared in November 2010, five years ago: “Our effort for a multi-cult society has completely failed.”
She added: “Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society.”
"All attempts at such coexistence have completely failed."
In a country where there are four million Muslims, she says, there is no strategy that has allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live next to each other without integrating. Today they live here with us and we have been lying for a while that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach where we say we simply live happily next to each other, so that approach has failed.
I totally failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
This shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rapidly escalating.
Mr Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Member of the SPD, the only one who is allegedly not even graduating from the European Parliament - yes, that's the one Mr Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play a supervisor in a concentration camp from a minute on - has shown himself several times.
It seems, especially under the impression of recent statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Let us note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of countries that have been victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, and solid Germans?
Who for years have tried, at least on the outside, to cope with their horrific past as an aggressor and killer of millions?
Are those who say that in the soul of Germany is sown the devil of aggression, superiority and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he put an end to the attempts of the Great Germans to control the whole centre of Europe?
When did he say that the great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When he was suspended, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Greater Germany, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably came back in a different form.
After the attempt of the Marxists to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of, for example, ecology, which was by the way one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism.
We'd say sunny.
The German elites for a long time resisted the emergence of German nationalism, so they left all those fighters against the atom, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who everywhere in the world want to do something different and better, fully leaned on the side of the fighters against global warming, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they have forgotten that there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slovakian current that considers all Slavs a difficult verb - since the days of Karl Marx, who, according to the Jewish parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements of Schulz and German ministers openly threatening disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leader Germany.
Which must be listened to without apology.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we mix the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And there is, as always, capital behind it, especially the German capital, which is well suited to it and which stems from the fact that Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The pseudo-belief of the sunflowers first introduced the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism, and today it has brought them home and will bring perhaps millions more Muslims.
Who, tempted by the voices of sirens, will soon come across a wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and start to riot.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbors by force, again a part of its population - but as it seems, a smaller part - can ideologically infuriate, but in the end reality as always will reach it.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against incoming Islamists erupt?
Will Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time come to their aid, but certainly not assimilated to adopt local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, watching with fear the Islamization of their country, get into their hands?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superman Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict that has provoked in Europe the support of the sundial ideology, that is, the ideology of the elite and fundamentally totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the relentless treatment of the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient Eastern neighbours, this cannot go well.
Completion tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of intruders is to scare them to death.
Just tap and a robust tap will knock on you in a way that the weaker nature does not have to stop.
The resurrected head will smash you nicely and run you, and the rugged ones will accompany you on the way away (or rather run) the resurrected soldier and the resurrected statue.
Perhaps it's a pity that a talking tap can't actually be taken.
We'd be good at chasing a lot of scoundrels and assholes.
Oxalis corniculata (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates dry environments.
And so it is located between the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which although it belongs to the expansive weeds, but it creates a nice impression in terms of flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
She's inscrutable, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes dry environments, is easily adaptable, modest and unpretentious.
Although she creates sheets with a chaotic composition, it is worth observing and continuing to photograph.
The beauty of detail is only under the gaze of the petals - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a purple accompaniment.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes healthy diet during breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the importance of good nutrition when breastfeeding using images of breastfeeding children painted by the depiction of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and newly-baked mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic makeup of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, though Nine's tries to take the lead in Today Show
Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson’s departure to Canberry to cover the cost of the Liberal leadership’s leakage failed to create a sufficient rating boost for Today.
The morning show Nine, screened from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stranded in London as part of a week-long international television series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance did not seem to matter so much to Aussie TV viewers, as it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals compared to 330,000 viewers of Today broadcast.
Today saw a slight increase in its ratings compared to Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only below last quarter (343,000).
Today has been filling the gap at Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting this morning more than just parliament, friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand, has an average of very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics have been wondering if Thomson himself would be able to tighten the TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Yesterday's result was a clear yes.
The X Factor from Seven retained a strong 1,136 million viewers, defeating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded mixed tracks on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) hosted by Andrew O'Keefe had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 5:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers and the second half an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to a drop in The Chase Australia ratings from the second night, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute show, which failed to defeat McGuir's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy – but who does he choose?
The Secret Revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly found out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to the bachelor's is covered in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who remain standing will definitely not reveal who the real one is who will eventually get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they were only two, they thanklessly told us who would win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue until Thursday's final.
All three women lyrically chanted why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler about who will get the heart of Bachelor.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood apart from them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been in a relationship ever since.
“From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course,” says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthly woman, she's a lot of fun with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They are both good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could make a great couple with Sam Wood.
For her, she claims that during his last visits to her home, she realized that Wood could be "the right one."
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this wasn’t just a game anymore – I opened my whole heart to him now.”
I asked who Wood would choose if she didn't, and she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls equally - it's between Snow and Lana indecisively.
The bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after he moved to the United States, and many teams questioned him after his great training start at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was done by an Australian rugby league convert on the first dig from a throwout on Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he trusted the player and gave him another chance to return and cast him in the game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a post-match press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received encouragement from special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only take care of the next game.
In the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for during his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught on the pitch when he left the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his NFL career he could not even imagine.
“It happens, you just focus on the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trapeze to his original debut in 2007, when recording in his own goal area led to a Queensland triplet.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne has posted a photo with fans holding an Australian flag on Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with guns on a Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts limited.
The U.S. stood up to the emigrants who demanded compensation for the property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the couple applied for compensation under the Out-of-court Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the requested amount, i.e. over 2.8 million kronor, but the court of appeal changed their claim so that it only granted them less than 90,000 kronor, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the price regulations of 1991.
The supreme court ruled against the migrants and handed them the amount originally charged.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, however, turned a complaint to the US.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time – although it was then an adequate compensation in relation to the deprived property – today reaches only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of by-law participants as in the restitution of eligible persons who have been claiming their rights at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to obtain compensation earlier," the judge, Jaroslav Fenyk, explained to the rapporteur, why <0xC3><0x9A>S stood on the side of emigrants.
"The CJU has repeatedly stated that the general courts should proceed in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation, i.e. the reparation of the property tort caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved."
Evita in the musical Studio DVA will now be played by Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová.
By the way, Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová became the youngest Evita in the world, when in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech premiere of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague theater Spirála.
To return to the same role, he says: "Today, the performance has not been matched by Evita's demands."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
In the role of the first lady of Argentina, she was recommended by Monika Absolon.
I saw the monk in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Suddenly, I saw a completely new concept.
I am a big fan of more modern adaptations, but this one is just particularly successful.
"Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol's film is original, lightweight and contemporary," says Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová.
The imaginative transmission of the musical sceptre between the two singers will take place at the Birthday Concert of Monica Absolon on September 27 at 7 pm at the Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Don't Cry For Me Argentina!)
In a limited number of performances, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol will also step aside from the director's dashboard when he plays the role of President Perón during the filming of Karl Roden.
Due to public interest, additional terms were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokola was directed by Monica Absolon, who originally studied the female lead role.
Next to her is Karel Roden as President Perón and as Che Peter Strená<0xC4><0x8D>ik.
The legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prost<0xC4><0x9B>jovsky are performed by a live orchestra led by Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof Mark, who participated in the first performance at the Spiral Theatre.
Four people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber projectiles at a crowd of protesters against a draft new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district's chief officer, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and firing bombs.
Mr. Dhakal says police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the last in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and has mitigated their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally controlled for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators in Kathmandu this week voted on the provisions of the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We definitely shouldn't panic now.
After losing on the ice to the champion Litvínov, you did not manage a domestic duel with the Spartans (3:5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly catastrophic entry into the extraliga as you were a year ago?
I hope it doesn't happen again.

NHC predicts 60 percent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of Cape Verde’s southernmost islands is 60 percent likely to form a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system in the middle of Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecast added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has said it is launching a campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries fleeing war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Rita Masoud, a Google employee, posted a report on her blog based on her personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old.
“We traveled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like mine are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among 4 non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said all contributions made through google.com/refugeerelief to the tune of $5.5 million would double.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II, with most coming from Syria, which has been plagued by a four-year war that has displaced 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
“The data on mortality takes a long time to show,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote the editorial for the new JAMA surgery study.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery use various methods to reduce the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the study was conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates a person is overweight, and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected from a 2007 study that deals with two types of bariatric surgery – stomach bypass and gastrectomy – in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients undergoing surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1 percent and partially only in about 2 percent of patients.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol have also been shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflects the continuous level of blood sugar in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers say.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, this figure remained at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — which is reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1), and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent), and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show improvements in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to prolonged life, says Blackstone of University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had a 29 percent higher chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared to the group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvements in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it is a soothing result for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This is where this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the group with a lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he said.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after a patient’s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation,” he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that tightly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He argued that, under the present circumstances, the interests of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that “the violent U.S. response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four times the number of children who have consumed sanitary agent in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who ingested a highly alcoholic sanitary agent, according to the Georgian Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the toxicological center of Georgia, the number of intakes of sanitation products in children under the age of 12 that were reported to the poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children get to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the ER,” Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation deliberately, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking sanitation because of low-cost cravings.
The teenagers allegedly mixed the sanitizer with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to an attractive fragrance means.
"Children don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (sanitary) remedies are those that are perfumed.
Sanitary products with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges are available, which are very attractive for children.
Sanitary products contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several loops can mean alcohol poisoning.
“It’s a highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital’s Toxicology Control Center, to the Fox 4 station in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t just let a glass of whiskey roll, either, but people leave these sanitizers out, and when children get to them, it’s a quick way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed up to four flakes of a strawberry-scented sanitary agent at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered unclear words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell over alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange for sanitation products to be out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation products have been linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitation product containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Physicians believed that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York planned to poison their "evil" teacher by placing antibacterial products in the room, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and prohibited their presence in the room.
The police rated the messed up plan as "innocent gossip," and referred to the school district's discipline,
No discrepancies in the Celtic team
Griffiths trivializes talk of disagreement in Celtic, while Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he will reverse it again.
The Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty by ADAMA Rooney secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, giving the Dons a five-point lead between themselves and the Celtic.
Griffiths denies disagreement
This situation sparked rumours of disagreement at Celtic, which were denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his team-mates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for the match with the Dutch league leaders.
“I don’t think we’re feeling pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Deficit in Scotland's title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers back-up and former Dutch national Ronald de Boer say Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer any rivalry between them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax’s ambassador, said: “The Netherlands is no longer showing the best of Celtic matches, and why?”
Because there's no Rangers anymore.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
He's talking about the old company.
They’re talking about both teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Company matches and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'll turn things back to the good, Deil commits.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a bit stumped, but the Norwegian boss pledged to turn things back to the good.
Malm's defeat and subsequent Champions League dropout was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already experienced bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about current events.
We are exactly the same, but we have to move on.
Really, we really need support from Celtic, because thanks to it, the players are much better.
Now it is very important to stay with each other.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcements
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and hinted that he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is worried about large-scale power purchases and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former Brentford boss says, “The summer transition window is very different from the summer window.”
Players coming in the summer have the entire pre-season season to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage will occur by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu's transition goal suggests retirement
The attacker of Swansea Michu, who was tied to Celtic in a transfer window, suggested he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
A 20-year-old gunman has been struggling with a prone ankle for two years and has not been able to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by referee Collum, which was cancelled.
Neilson stands behind his claim, stating, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics directed to former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a threatening moment," the striker said, adding: "I can safely say I won't return to Tynecastle unless it's in the Celtic jersey."
Council in Tannadice believes in driving Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still believes in correcting the situation with the current management of the team – but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're going to get the boys back in action," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for 'ugly victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to cling desperately to Hamilton Accies to get their seventh straight league win and a five-point lead over the Celtics at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won anything, be it the cups or the leagues, without winning this type of matches.”
Scottish Unemployment Remains Unchanged as UK Total Unemployment Rises
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged to 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK (5.5 percent), according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a period of three months, with the number of workers now stopping at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent in the quarter, a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell said in a commentary on the latest data: “The long-term government plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In these 12 months, we have witnessed further improvement in the labour market and Scottish employment has risen, while unemployment has fallen.
Why I Saw the Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'll be watching the man's death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'm going to sit in a viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Prison Death Chamber and see Richard Glossip, who's going to be executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who will witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day draws near, I'm starting to be afraid of it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to be able to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more applications than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being conducted that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalist seats from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen, he'll watch the whole execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends and make a special bond with him through months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk to each other.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I will have to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma reporter accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeder as he pleases, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the proceedings against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the podcast series I created.
I will not repeat all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is bad.
And it's from this perspective that I'm going to watch his death.
I can't say I'll be really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you'll get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die in vain.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after freeing the man from Canning River.
The bet of a man from Petrhu to flee the police did not come out after getting into the shallow muddy water just meters from the policeman, who tried to forcefully persuade him to return to the shore.
Canning Vale police were summoned in the incident encroaching on Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water and repeated, 'I'm not going out, just come for me,'" said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things while running away," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove into a ditch to avoid a bus and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousin’s biathlon.
Peter Moody says organizers have tried to spy on him and threaten to end races
Peeter Moody accused the organizers of Racing Victoria of trying to get him into the stables last year and threatened to immediately end the race.
He focused on the organizers and integrity department of Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with late-scratching Lady Tatai in maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for the race and had found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarina’s positive smear on cobalt that he couldn’t explain.
He bit his tongue on charges of spying for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home today and get a good night's sleep.
I want to keep my head up and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I'll have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Previously, Moody released a bomb in his interview with racing.com that the integrity department had attempted to spy on him.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — who I’m going to name after the question — and offering him a job in my stables for finding out about the things that are going on in my stables,” Moody told Rac.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an attempt to catch me, they're completely burned.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's going to be a personal matter?
Will the RVL keep a few balls growing and make sure that people outside the coaching position take responsibility for what’s going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe they need me to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will provide them with material to think about.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really saddened me.
I will put pressure on them and carry the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The level of frustration of the coach has risen with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent scratching in it has aroused the feeling that he "could clock his license on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the treatment rule on the day of the race "ridden" after a clay pad or mud was applied to the horses' feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could've had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treatment of tiles on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver who escaped was arrested
Police arrested a man who crashed a cyclist in Cobra on the weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the main Murray Valley road on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia himself confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in the event of an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in a stable condition at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy returns to rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach of Melbourne Storm, criticized the actions of his players as "making a plan" for two NRL premiership fans.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during Storm's controversial win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly disguised remark to Strom after his team won the qualifying finals over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "preview" of the rugby league and said two from Queensland were "not too much."
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said they focused on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that the situation has increased his confidence because his team is being criticized by two senior coaches, which may mean they are afraid of losing to Storm.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," he said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the last year we have not changed anything from our defensive system and techniques, in the last weeks we have only put emphasis on contact during the interventions, and that has meant a turnaround for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously he’s training a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like that always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy devalued Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's team of St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that he finds frustrating, especially his young backers with their speed.
This is the kind of football you would like to play if you had this type of player available.
He said this in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two backers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that style can't be played.
It gives me more self-confidence because they say things like that because they’re afraid of fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got into big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that the Storm and Roosters scored more goals than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, I didn't watch, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and non-scoring attempts interesting?
I think they are agendas.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday evening at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man who faced a possible life for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled from Queensland was given a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from a Solay yacht that came from South America via Vanuatu and anchored in Coomer in August.
Maksimovic was spotted at a meeting with the defendants at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for the possession of cocaine of commercial quality, lawyer Maksimovice defended that there was no evidence that he would own the entire quantity and that he could be in the cafe entirely by chance and innocent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would have fled.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
In the corona case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovice's mother and stepfather jointly offered a $200,000 bail for his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both parties, it is clear that the $200,000 deposit is a real financial burden for them," Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were clearly inadequate, because the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, will report to the police daily and will abide by the exit ban from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg Uses Girl's Phone to Entice Pedophiles to Post Pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then signed up for her on her online chat, where he had a lot of rude photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found that her phone was missing, and then found it in the hands of sleeping Hogg.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
Police got involved and saw five photographs, then analytics computers found the address and discovered "worrisome" searches on the web using terms to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to police that his reason was to “put pedophiles on the internet” before he would “pretend to be a police officer and frighten them.”
Eilidh Robertson, a fiscal deputy, told Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it was an addiction — that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was conducting a computer search, but claimed that he was only trying to pretend to be a police officer to intimidate paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them.
He says he jumped drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the news on her phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw immoral pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant was using her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a resident of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking or providing inappropriate pictures of children on June 14 last year, violated bail conditions on January 25, and failed to appear in court on March 24.
Advocate Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual offenders because he could argue that there was "no substantial sexual background" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence to October due to reports from social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual offenders before the date of his verdict.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe makes a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the staircase leading to the stage earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also stained by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous threats of killing that warned them of Mr Mugabe’s accusations during his speech.
Last month, he was whispered and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, president of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to obstruct Mugabe’s speech.
"The report comes from a number that doesn't appear, but is called 'death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and as soon as they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The leader said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai had "worries" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the company’s business services costs.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of around $2.7 billion and start in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable costs for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board, who will lead the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of businesses that will help businesses transition to a new style of business,” said Whitman.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parkard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion following the company’s announcement and will “focus on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions” to companies.
The company was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who produced electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP underwent a massive reorganization to manage the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a narrowly specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get to the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it was still September and that if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason not to play at Christmas again.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is obviously uncertain.
The big pity of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back into his former form during the preseason.
"This type of injury does not endanger a career," Wenger said.
It is a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. has recorded 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he made his gaming debut six years ago.
During the last five years, he played only in 65 league matches of the Arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the spelled circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back after an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win competition,” Wenger says.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilizing, I’m sure he is, and he’ll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe out," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of being the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not defeated in a total of 41 games after maintaining their "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by a 3.2-degree Richter earthquake on Wednesday night.
That was already set in Zagreb this year.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned from last season’s Champions League capitulation against Monaco and has a long way to go to lead the club to its first European Cup win.
"This deployment is huge," Wenger says.
This has never happened to the arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A Comedy Show That Gives Us Serious Lessons About Male Friendship
The absence of similar views in various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperately than ever before when it comes to suicide among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured person had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends presents a half chance of experiencing mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be achievable first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style rather than the content of the message, an immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and more successful has doubled, even though in reality we are more isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values – our personal desire for growth and friendship – which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game creator recently explained, money really won’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which radiated through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, moments watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stemming from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: “My role as a listener to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage “to deal with it” is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up to problems.
Friends are one of the shows that come up in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term balancing mechanism.
It highlights small moments in a male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the state of an outsider on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater proximity, from a network of friends and family.
So if you’re going to the FrendsFest this weekend hosted by Comedy Central, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG push Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored his Champions League debut and helped PSG defeat Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's a report on the match and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday’s match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his Champions League debut and this PSG player sent the French champions for a win, but then they dropped a few chances until they finally boosted their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not only focused on qualifying for the elimination rounds, but on improving their path to the quarterfinals, which they have recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it wasn't a classic performance for Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted ahead of the goal and was later substituted against his home team and club, where he began his famous career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League, either at home or outside, so a 2-0 win is a problem for our opponents, and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even though there are things that we will have to improve with the progress of the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from his injury as one of three changes to PSG, who had a 2-2 draw at home this weekend with Bordeaux in Ligue 1, but was overshadowed by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian wing was marked as a man who pushed PSG in Europe to a new level after transferring from Manchester United last month, and showed why when he ran into Marc Verratti’s pass for Malm’s defense and sent the ball behind Johan Wilanda’s back to the far corner of the goal with a beautiful finish.
However, if anyone expected this to kick off PSG’s spectacular victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs and made it to this stage, entered with 9 internationals in the base line-up and five defenders and two back-ups were a heavy opponent.
But apart from the shot of Nikola Djurdjice, who just passed Kevin Trapp's far corner in the 34th minute, there was not much offered in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves argued for the advantage of the attack with bad innings and a miserable ending, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who was unable to shoot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot reached the network shortly after the start of the second half.
However, he turned out to be much more fitting when it came to preparing a chance for his teammates, and it was just from his innings that Di Maria sent a rotating bullet that ended up in the wiland goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan sent the header behind the line already the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic added to him after the pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all of Malm's thoughts about the possibility that they could benefit from the match, and only the excellent intervention of Wilanda from a close distance frustrated David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of alternating Ezequiel Lavezzi was not at the end of the match.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class higher than his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have played only the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion for Share Sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which has been hit by a commodity price crash, made $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan on Wednesday.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth around <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to repay the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling to mitigate commodity prices as China’s slowdown reduces demand and ignites sparks of destruction across markets.
The issue of rights on Wednesday sent the Glencore stock price to the top of the London stock market in early-morning trades.
Stocks jumped 2.77% to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed last week that $2.5 billion in stock sales are part of broader plans to reduce its $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third.
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about prolonging the slowdown in China’s growth have cut the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its report on Tuesday.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, to a state dinner that will take place at the end of the talks.
“President Xi’s visit presents an opportunity to strengthen US-China relations and encourages cooperation in resolving problems of international, regional and common interest, and an opportunity to constructively debate the differences between the two countries,” the report said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington, and then continue to New York for a September U.N. meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis has disrupted the Schengen area.
The emergency lantern fired by Germany has far from set the European crew on fire, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, the French newspaper Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal first with the refugee problem: it will rather systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece - than to argue over the future allocation of refugees by quotas based on the amounts that have risen in real terms.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the member states changed their priorities.
Before taking care of the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are already arriving today and to solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the ministers said in a text discussed in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis of the single currency, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases the pressure.
It re-establishes border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the tide of those seeking asylum in that country.
The central power thus makes it clear that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday has already served as proof.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
That it is a domino effect, but it also sees the blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of compulsory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already crossed into the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizière discussed the matter intensively during a private interview with their three counterparts from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being implemented stiffly.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest refuses to set up any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that there will be camps on its shoulders where refugees will accumulate at its expense.
The real black hole is Greece, of course.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, which is twice the number that has recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after going through crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge beeping hole.
Athens, still in financial turmoil, awaiting a new government, put their hands in its lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and a source of now common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to set up checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on the front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the European Border Control Agency's intervention teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen its oversight of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word in Athens.
The issue of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation of the 18-year-old has already pushed the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was set up by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament earlier this year and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise involves the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed in June during the EU's hectic summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, three of them allegedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the German nationality is also a woman who survived as the only one of the affected eight-member group.
Previous media reports said it was Polka.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with a serious leg injury in the femur.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly 40-year-olds.
"The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims have also been transported to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountainous region below the top of the 4015-metre Dome de Neige des Ecrins mountain.
"The avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, a huge amount of snow fell on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The Meteorological Service did not warn in the area of unpleasant weather today.
Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> before the match with Braga: Finally the real Europe.
Coach Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> during his premiere in the cups managed to pass through the pre-season of the European league to the base group with the Liberec players and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slovan welcomes the 2011 Braga finalist at the start of the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, when every goal and every situation could have left you on your way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don’t have to be afraid of every goal scored, we can play our tactics and we are not bound by mere doubles.
"I'm really looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before that it was just a qualification," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said at a press conference.
Braga is considered a top team.
It will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent will probably be harder because he does not have such a name, but he has a player in his squad who, I think, gave Manchester three goals.
"It's an excellent whole at the top level of the teams," said Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
But he doesn’t consider Braga a favorite.
I take it we play at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown both in the domestic competition and in the pre-race that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost from eleven duels this season only the inaugural Super Cup in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec can impose his style on Braze as well.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is unusually disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 layout with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, although we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the field," said Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
In the pre-race we studied a lot of opponents, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted the training.
"And we certainly want, although it will be very difficult, to play according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films dominate Písek, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries have submitted their works to the 15th edition of the International Student Film Festival in Písek.
Four dozen of them, sent to the final by a committee of students and educators, will be screened from 15 to 18 October in the Porty<0xC4><0x8D> cinema.
The best of them will be selected by an international jury, said Jakub Charvát, a spokesman for the festival.
Each year the festival has its own special theme, which derives from the festival sound.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year’s festive evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre productions in them.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our campaign this year," Charvat said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student creations - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which will include last year’s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Shard.
The organizers of the festival, as every year, prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Smeykal, turbo<0xC5><0xA1>anson band We Fly?, playing band Zrní or for example Petra Hapková with recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will be brought by the graduate of the Sand Film School and the winner of the prestigious awards, among which there is no shortage from World Press Photo 2014, Jana A<0xC5><0xA1>enbrenner.
The second exhibition will bring the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin <0xC4><0x8C>ech will speak with the visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber with his music and the sandstone natives Brukner, Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> will baptize his new book 3 friends from the city P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek, patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop common bonds and the film industry," the spokesperson said.
The Pitching forum will certainly help, too, where students can meet film professionals, pass several job auditions at once and thus gain a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private Higher Professional Film School in Písek.
Its founders, husbands Vladana and Milo<0xC5><0x88> Ter<0xC4><0x8D>ovi, organized the first year in 1997.
By the sixth grade, it was held every two years.
In the event of a CK bankruptcy, the insurance companies have to pay the clients’ claims in full.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
It was decided on Wednesday by the House when it approved an amended amendment to the Law on the Conditions of Business in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee according to the draft, which is directed to the Senate for assessment.
Insurance companies with an obligation to pay the claims of clients even above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on the adjustment, argues consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end insurance for travel agencies against bankruptcies when the news comes into effect.
The proposal is also being criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to leave or go abroad.
Local Development Minister Karla <0xC5><0xA0>lechtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full reimbursement are not euro-compliant.
She pointed out this year’s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, stressed <0xC5><0xA0>lechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit that it is feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, Vice President of TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work, because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to terminate their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
The chairman of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalouskov’s concerns on the basis of a survey among the members of the CK.
"Stop showing us the lobbying of insurance companies," he said.
The statements of the insurance companies are not considered by Okamura as relevant, and no official written statement in this sense exists.
They say they are trying to find out if the travel agencies will be involved, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competitive Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about lubricating the stairs of Czech travel agencies, also warned about the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
“Consumer protection works,” says Fischer.
The House did not approve her proposal to release the disputed passage.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Filip (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) did not come forward with a proposal to return the draft to the committee because of the alleged conflict with the civil code.
Filip pointed out that travel agencies could pose a threat to consumers.
The draft rapporteur, Martina Berdychová (ANO), has withdrawn her proposal in view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance performance will not cover the entire risk.
The amendment does not initially propose a minimum insurance limit of four million for travel agencies that offer air travel, and a million limit for agencies that sell, for example, bus travel.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales of tours.
However, the limit of insurance performance will have to be such that in the event of a bankruptcy of the travel agent, it will cover all the claims of the customers.
Even after the adjustments, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to re-indicate which travel agency organizes the trip for the sold trips.
Travel agencies will have to submit to the insurance companies before concluding the contract, among other things, data on the management and the number of trips.
The approved amendment of the Committee on Public Administration is also expected to provide further regular information to insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and travel sold, the total price of travel sold and the amount of advances and revenues for travel and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to comply with any of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will, in accordance with the draft, call for remediation or will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event that the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of the customers.
The novel also aims to re-adjust the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the grant to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial spending plan and an outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the drafter of the law did not conceive of the situation that will occur if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to organize trips and clients who purchased the trip before cancelling the insurance will lose it according to the association.
In such a case, CK will suffer a significant loss and may even collapse, even though its management was in good condition.
One of the ways travel agencies can deal with such a situation will be to sue the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and take advantage of much softer conditions abroad and then in our market we will act only as agencies, said Jan Pope<0xC5><0xBE>, vice-president of the association.
According to him, the draft amendment also includes a bank guarantee institute, but so recklessly that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since the bank guarantee cannot sound like an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, the change in the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, it will be necessary to recast the entire law in the light of the new EU directive.
There are now a total of 942 active insured travel agencies operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have completed their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell trips worth about CZK 20 billion a year.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German Prime Ministers.
At the same time, it again called for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 member states.
We need to help more the countries from which refugees leave, or where they stay after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will set up decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said, according to which such a signal could also be increased financial aid or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the burden of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
Brandenburg Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The allocation of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected, among other things, by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke have also called for an accelerated asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to begin the integration of foreigners more quickly, said the Prime Minister of Brandenburg.
He also believes that most of the money Germany spends on caring for refugees should be used to integrate those who have a chance to get asylum.
More teachers will be needed to help the refugees learn German.
It’s a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if we manage to integrate the refugees, they can be a benefit for us, he said.
Matt Damon's role in the film
Matt Damon confronted Afroametic filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During a Sunday episode of the HBO project Greenlight, the actor cast in the Brown series interrupted by stressing the need for alternative views about the black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re doing it by casting a movie and not by casting a show,” Damon said.
Shocked, Brown reacted indignantly with distrust and sighed, "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with co-producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they will behave towards the character of Harmony," Brown said.
The only black character who's a whore wrapped in a white raccoon.
Producer of The Precious White People promoted finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to direct the film; Damon cut off that their directing "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon’s comment.
Twitter user MrPooni said: "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet has received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was released.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national prominence and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against black people.
In February, the singer Prince made references to the movement, while citing nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"The albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The latest leader of Black Lives Matter released a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” he said.
Damon was recently listed on the list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss depicting the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior has its first winner.
Professional climber and pickle Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home $1 million.
In a race that has just finished its seventh season, none of the competitors have managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the finals of this season, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb over a 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first to climb within the set limit, becoming the first competitor to overtake a forceful 4 in the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero overcame him by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for the E! News news shortly after his hard-earned victory and was known to be still in shock of winning the $1 million main prize.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” Isaac E! said in response to his win.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it will be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten won no award despite becoming the first contestant to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who finishes the track the fastest.
“If more than one competitor participates in the race, the winner will be the one with the best time,” Weed said.
Although winning a major win would have changed his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he'd have any resentment.
He is happy that he has achieved what he has achieved.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.”
Geoff said to me, "If there was anyone who could have defeated me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I had won, Isaac would have felt the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue its eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
Detroit tigers pass just around the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit tigers, the second half of the season was not exactly a walk in the rose garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is currently in the final position of the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers narrowly reversed their defeat by defeating Minnesota 5–4 in a Tuesday match at Target Field.
The twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and grab the second wildcard in the American League.
Even if only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which for them during the second half of the season was so infallible.
“Winning is always fun and it doesn’t matter how,” said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger striker Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive lead and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 starts and 3 laps.
It was his third successful game in the last nine games.
“I want to end this year with convincing results,” Simon said.
“It’s hard to get used to the game when you’re sitting on the bench often and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tigers striker Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 laps and his first rebound point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last game in June, in which he hit four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned on it nicely," Ausmus said.
"He looked good in training, fired significantly better and managed to get it into the game."
With three laps at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins had the greatest chance of getting back into the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton won the change thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
Right pole Aaron Hicks scored a point thanks to a set thumb, and Simon pulled out Brian Dozier before being replaced by leftist Blaine Hardy.
Hardy kicked out his only opponent, Mauer, and ahead of him was the batsman Miguel Sano, who fired the ball and rounded two goals, leaving right-hander Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on goal and a chance to draw in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third goal over two goals.
Plouffe has already won 27 laps over two goals this season and reigns in the league tables.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon scored 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander dismissed Sano for three setbacks.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes' game.
The Tigers won three laps in the first two shifts against a retired right-hander who entered the game after more than a month's pause due to back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly didn't imagine a start like this," said Hughes, "but in the third shift I felt I could throw better."
After resisting the strain in the first shift, Hughes dropped one point to the other meta Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for right pole J.D. Martinez took Victor Martinez out, who was the first to round all the goals.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
The third goalkeeper, Nick Castellanos, followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored the next round, but Victor Martinez was knocked out when he tried to race to the third goal.
The tigers added in the second shift when pitcher James McCann and pole Anthony Gose scored two and then one point, and the score was 3-0 on the final table.
“It got us to our knees,” said Gemini manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won by the number of throws, finished in the third shift without points and was replaced by the right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes scored three goals, six starts and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right thrower of the Tigers, ended the match with pain in the right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez’s arm in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list due to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, is set to enter the match on Wednesday.
Sanchez replaces leftist Daniel Norris, who returns after being injured and takes on the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded for left-hander David Price, he has scored 1-1 after 4 games.
However, since August 20, he has not played yet due to stretched muscles.
Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) faces Minnesota left-hander Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," he said of the 16th meeting of the central leadership group to deepen the overall reform.
Promoting openness in emerging reforms will add new momentum and vitality, as well as provide a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Leading Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policies, the support to public enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the registration resident system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, securing a legal business environment and making the market more open.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and make sure that companies themselves will decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up a state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are funded from abroad and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," thanks to the optimization of requirements and simplification of the application process.
Securing the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior officials Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, new bed divisions may emerge.
According to Deputy Head of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Panik (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the current capacity of the bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to expand care in the region.
For example, a one-day surgery center could be established at the department of surgical departments, where, according to the established concept, the operations of surgical disciplines that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
In which specific hospitals the workplace focused on one-day surgery should be, it is not yet clear.
At the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser center could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apal center that would care for patients with brain impairments who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Island Hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, are the follow-up care beds, in particular the beds of the Treatment of Long-Term Sick (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdk is insufficient and should above all be closely linked to the beds of acute care.
Part of this facility should function as rehabilitation beds and part as classic LDN beds, the concept recommends.
As he points out, the beds of follow-up care are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There, abandoned buildings could be used after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease are absent.
These beds are scarce throughout the Republic, so they could also serve other regions as the so-called Alzheimer's Center.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, to which the funds of European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will follow the fields of superspecialized care and will provide space for patients to translate after surgery, for example, after cardiosurgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery," the regional bed care concept describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
