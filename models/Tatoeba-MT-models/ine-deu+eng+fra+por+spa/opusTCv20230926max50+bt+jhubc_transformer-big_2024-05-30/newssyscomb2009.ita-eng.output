The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The appreciable weakening of both existing parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties, led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously vacillating, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), Kärnten’s deputy prefect Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the vote, but loses 5.5% compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse went for <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian postwar history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the people, which provoked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage over SP<0xC3><0x96> in the preferences.
But the voters have obviously punished them for bringing down the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there have been speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe it could take place as early as Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties -the liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) won 18% in advance and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% of the votes- but the socio-democrats at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the populists to separate the state from the collective government, (then the BFP was still part of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>).
On this development obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in the national policy.
The Green Party also managed to enter the parliament, but it fell slightly, falling from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally collecting beetles in India could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, there would be some cooling in Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it is not resolved, then there will be some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the talks that the executive can hardly interfere in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," the Minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher court.
Then he can ask for bail and wait for his sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed the same during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Supreme Court then it will be possible to get the pardon," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been going on for many years with India.
Indians also admit it,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, before his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We truly consider the imprisonment and indictment of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question whether he had received the Indian side’s promise to deal with the matter.
"I've gotten relatively many promises," he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small lost spot in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time large as the continent itself, says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers from the OSN Division for Ocean Affairs and Maritime Rights.
Its head, the Czech attorney-director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and from time to time he adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and the enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metallic minerals and other minerals, but also living organisms unknown so far that carry the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest bottom of the mainland
The coastal states have begun to lend interest to the underwater territory.
According to the OSN convention, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is above all the area of the so-called continental platform that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
According to the convention, it has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental platform.
"In short, by continental shelf we mean that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very extensive technical-scientific documentation based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the commission with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees were successful,” adds Mikulka.
Australia’s recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine holdings, has recorded a worldwide echo.
But New Zealand also earned us - the seabed area, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers, which is more or less six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bring him in the future from the seabed, as they promise, will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends begins the ocean floor area that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity.
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Seabed is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime established contractually."
The Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
It acquired in 1991 under the convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is flared, it is an almost submarine replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” explains another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonian division, Rober Sandev, brings an item with him to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of imagination, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the liberation of the hostages.
The Egyptian government had sought help from Germany to free the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
We receive more and more detailed information on the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages seized.
German special units participated in the rescue operation as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to the army specialists, the GSG9 units, the Federal Aviary Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the logistical experts of the technical institution were present on site.
German forces did not intervene, the ministry spokesman said, because the kidnappers, in view of the danger of a forceful intervention, released the hostages while fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We weren't lucky to get there," a spokesman for the interior ministry said.
Attackers kidnapped a group of travelers in southern Egypt on September 19: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the liberated have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units are expected to depart in flight with an Airbus of the military air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout.
The first chamber of Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and prominent politicians from both parties, there had been no majority for the program, which would have had to end the chaos of the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, supporters have desperately tried to persuade critics from the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the negotiating leaders, urged MPs to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While voting was in progress, the Dow Jones fell by more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state bailout package might fail.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters register increasing numbers of bookings
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has increased significantly - for the winter season even by more than 30%.
Despite weak economic outlook, the desire of Germans to travel according to an investigation remains firm.
On bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded an increase of 31% in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as reported Monday in Berlin the German association for tourism DRV.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are increased booking quotas even for the autumn months.
So the excess of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DRV said.
Assumption for these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 would also be included.
Due to the weak dollar quote, particularly required would be travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly popular travel destinations with Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Especially all-inclusive travel is highly priced, DRV President Klaus Laepple said.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better computable for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for bookings made early or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year it would again have recorded an excess of turnover - although according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip,compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Ballermann's hits, one-liter glass beer and vip in scratched dirndln.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually have not much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a custom made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing we have in common: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, already the photographers throw themselves against us and take pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The two-money dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist from Wiesn and actually a resident north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in costume/dress to this day remains within limits.
And once you get to the Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Dirndl collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A nun tells me that I would have tied the apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are engaged, behind a widow."
I put my bow on the back to the left.
It's okay," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, headed "To drunk to get dressed!" and iron the naked back against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is named Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a crawling "ooooo"..
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer jar from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a dumpster.
Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbieslers".
Others are not fortunate enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 p.m., the Sanitaries walk in packs on the square of the party, who must take care of the poor beoni
Nurses appear in batches every time – always 4 at a time dragging a tent-covered cradle into the tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the canvas in this coffin of alcohol in the blood,you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the toilets yells to me and disappears into the baron.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died shortly after.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of unconscious driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what tourist guides tell you.
The building stands on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling to the vault, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a laggard to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railroad that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly gone into disrepair, far surpassed by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all points to the east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-larger diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping wagon for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after a run uphill along the tracks that produced the old-world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital – proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by built-up media malls and power pastries, where managers in business suites - both men and women - meet to make early-morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The aim of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
“The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today he must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with either of them.
They must be both.
"But certainly at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "does not want to face that choice."
Then he points out one point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has acted in memory: the links of the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines eastward through Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be, in large part, in Turkey's hands.
And while I wait at the ferry terminal that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there did not seem to be any doubt as to which continent to advance demands on this fascinating country.
Reminders: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, September 11,) had in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21/under 21, but by the time Proteus sang its finale in 1979, many of us were over 20 – we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to face everything that music presented to do, either madrigal or messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astounding, always exciting, and it was all because of that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
“Sing it!”
His technique in using the stick was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a conductor as a knight, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have watched more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal grandeur and modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "run around the world one or two well-known battle horses."
So many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman ... studying at the same time for a degree in science, a degree in letters and a PhD."
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950–51 in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, we don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in a documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resin captures magical moments.”
Second assault for Honda supersellers
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new van has an even wider interior space.
In addition, there is a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution vs. Revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this van are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanics.
However, before proceeding to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the heads of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz within a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow the Honda .to reduce the drop in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company’s managers expect to reach the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, 4,000 less than in 2007, with a 16% drop.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a compact, five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters long - which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and according to estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight sales will take place in the US, while the remaining percentage will be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, shortly after its presentation at the company in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and its span is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the living interior is also expanded.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the insertion of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk - equipped with a double background - rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measures of the engine version 1.4, and that the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - relate to an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be offered in models with petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption, produces less carbon dioxide emissions, optimizes mechanics and at the same time keeps engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model allows you to enjoy a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous powertrain, which used 83 horsepower in the first-generation model, there are now 100 available.
The Jazz 1.4 at 100 horsepower reaches a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking the flight of bees, for example, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Director of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of bees, able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, and allowing the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, the engineers developed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
This mechanism detects obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a on-board microprocessor that immediately, prevents collision.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Lab and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect up or down, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can rotate and not exploiting endless directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to their destination while avoiding obstacles along the way.
Trembling before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to owning a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing to garbage mortgages in dubious insolvency banks, they have created a fun and instructive game for users of the network: “Bad Credit Hotel.”
In other words, the "hotel of bad credits"... or problems.
The blunt appearance of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce you to think not one, but two or even three times before you ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is little detailed.
It’s more a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, he compares a song room inside the hotel.
It’s still something, because buying a better house doesn’t even talk about it.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest $9 billion in a 21% stake in the Company, news came as a result of a sharp decline in its shares in the stock market.
A week after drafting an interim agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley shares at an individual cost of $25.25, a sum of three billion dollars.
The fixed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley clarified that the global transaction would be based on an average price of $29 per bond, or less than its current rate of 28%.
By 5 p.m., Morgan Stanley was down 6.79 percent to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which is expected to allow it to differentiate its shares while still putting them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than they previously took.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that in recent days the deal has been modified: on Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for an amount equal to 8.5 billion dollars.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: "We thought our share of participation would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will acquire Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that MUFG can convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide details about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to establish a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" lightened its budget as of the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which has seen the value of its shares halve while the cost of risk insurance has plummeted.
The cost refluided on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among Wall Street's major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch takeover, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
To base the republic on socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white papers.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously," he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians within the Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place quietly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserved to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially on the oil extraction implemented by large foreign companies and consequently on their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and to propose his candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also states that health and education services are free of charge, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also bans the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of eleven tourists and their eight escorts seized ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive in the desert for ten days were reported safe and sound Monday afternoon in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base in Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 15:30, aboard a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any press interviews, to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They are in "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the hijackers," Egypt's Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Abducted on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one hideout to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous, the organizing agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, shortly before dawn.
"There have been shootings, half of the kidnappers have been killed, while the others have fled," the official said.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese military patrol said it had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle carrying the kidnappers and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers were linked to an organization of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a claim immediately denied by the latter.
The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that make people hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that they are neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we have no real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the restoration of the castle of Chinon, in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that states that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by common accord.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers from the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, grouped in 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets, preserve, with four dollars, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space for history and heritage be reserved?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping through partial nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to face difficulties due to the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion to the financial - insurance institution with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debating for more than a year is that of Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard may set a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first and foremost the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institution had then appeared in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares on Friday fell nearly 12%, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current share prices, the total capital value of the group is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, but according to the bank's executives this value is not real.
The company's summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainty of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the title slowly rebounded.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a deserving offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they should not be afraid to lose money.
There was no panic among the bank’s customers, the branches were not assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on people’s drug purchase data, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a privacy program whereby the use of prescription drug data in any case depends on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting the chicken to the fox,” writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick, the program’s author to follow the prescriptions of the drugs.
Insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the amount due in case of damages to the health of the potential customer and, if they consider the risk too high, do not take out insurance.
A long time ago, the client had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the examination was completed.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer's identification code, you can easily get information from pharmacies about what medicines he has purchased in the last year and a half and this program reveals what diseases he suffers from and in what health condition he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in the blood is practically incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are several versions of the program on the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, to the insurer so in addition to paperwork, there is not much left, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the downsides is that some medicines are usable for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraine or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance-commercial point of view, is a risk-increasing factor, the first two are not.
For the request and processing of data separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
Now the authorities are forcing her to do so even though they have not imposed fines for negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently processed the results of lab tests and linked them to medicine consumption data to provide a more accurate picture of patients’ health status.
More and more companies have access to data and, at the same time, controlling usage will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control competence to companies specializing in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that links the data transfer with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Marseilles menu
India and the European Union are doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade above all with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit was also dominated by this issue, as well as all other global issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal first and foremost with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes the fact that India is becoming a major democratic power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
Therefore, this issue was not stressed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as turnout president of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, chairman of the commission, and Javier Solana, high representative for foreign affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in 5 years, i.e. increase to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not a very ambitious target.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among the EU's partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it persists in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to conclude a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will visit the French capital today where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of nuclear energy in a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive a contract worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to our press agency, the deal would last 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as an honorary guest.
It will be the Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
This will be followed by a press meeting at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying in the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a 3000-metre high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson fled the doubts that remained: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared,” he said in a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was reported dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (NTSB) said that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, which then identified the device: this is the Bellana 8kcab, which has been missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for three hours.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal belongings of Fossett had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, of cash and a hoodie.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had travelled around the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his many records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An out-of-the-box SUV with an original and well-defined design with clear lines, wide surfaces and clear angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the offroad "compacts" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breeze of novelty in this field.
Due to its contents outside the traditional canons, it will also be unexpected and unconventional the communication that will accompany the launch of the SUV Glk, available at Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising battage that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car leaks out of the manifesto.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Eluma8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recomposed in a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new in the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to stir the interest of future buyers? We will see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultra Italia" that has been following the National Blue for years and that, for the truth, had never created excessive problems.
He had never met any of his opponents.
The drawing of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added small groups (few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tri-coloured flags where the militants' cities of origin appear: Saturday evening they were removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found a group of true Nazis, Levski’s.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all nominal, so easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium crimes, had been refused the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only the Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that is, that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others are added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they argue from the Viminale.
Therefore, "eyes well opened especially in view of the match of the National team on Wednesday in Lecce".
In fact, in Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow is the meeting of the Observatory, Tuesday the Casms that can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the stretched arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a really unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Observatory of the Viminale (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been quotor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the Observatory No. 1, “crimes must be attributed to the country where the event takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see well what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to the anthem of Mameli: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me, I am not an education...”.
