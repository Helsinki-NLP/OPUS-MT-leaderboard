UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year-old conflict and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a conference that he plans to meet this month with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present in the council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of a ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers “have made this situation unresolved.”
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they managed to conclude a deal on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 Figures from Surveys That Show Donald Trump Has Real Chances
Some have tried to label him a “flip-flop” politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump leads by a two-digit percentage and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate mogul’s nomination chances.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the Republican nomination race.
Pundits show that, during the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made room for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why it would be difficult to fight in general elections are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump’s power and start supporting him with money.
Below are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
Figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
Approximately 3 out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “disgusted” if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “enthusiastic” compared to 40% saying the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "disgusted" if favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don’t consider Trump’s temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombshell style, 52% of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same numbers in the state of Iowa, where all 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to a poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% say they don’t have the personality to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independents say their temperament has nothing to look for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans get used to the idea.
When they take the stance of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination race, four in 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans voted for Rick Perry in the nomination race, up from just 28% for Mitt Romney.
But these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or replies to another candidate. Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say the split situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while support against Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points away from Marco Rubio, 15 points away from Walker, 19 points away from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points away from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would defeat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have made a decision.
A new poll conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump’s most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely as voters who declare they have decided to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombshell style will lead to a split between major Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and harm rebranding efforts.
But according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
So it seems that as long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely because of their outsider status.
According to a poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the performance of Republicans in Congress, with 54% declaring themselves "dissatisfied" and 21% "nervous at the top".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Ever since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at PMQs has been long awaited.
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be closely analysed by the media and Labour MPs.
During the weekly appearances, he demanded “less theatre and more facts.”
He also said that he can give up a few participations and that he is ceding them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test in leadership, coming after he named a “ghost cabinet” and after his speech at the annual TUC congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to keep silence at the national anthem at a service on Tuesday on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative parliamentarians and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he "kept the silence respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghostly cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to join Mr. Corbyn's leadership team, arguing for differences of opinion on economics, defense and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are “cumulating” in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn’s appointment regarding his position towards the European Union and the benefit limit.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would bring about changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party "is very clear" in exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" level from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced on the podium in the last decade since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from outside sources” for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North said that PMQs involve a level of confrontation too high and that he will refrain from replications and attacks, committing instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Finance Minister, will hold his place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor occasionally, saying he had addressed the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over, Cameron said he wanted to give up the “Punch and Judy” political style often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his move.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he leads the House of Deputies, and his position among fellow parliamentarians, although critics claim it has become a cartoon and needs profound reform.
"Framework in Joburg": Homeless youth benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a profession and make a living.
“I Was Shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take photos of the areas they live in and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Harm Expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says a UK minimum wage increase could mean “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
However, it is unlikely that the respective purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for the workforce within the company, he says.
The costs could have an impact on JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by President of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior is rather commendable than critical, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest part of the talented duo often called “Special Ks,” was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios’ scandalous glide towards Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a head-to-head qualifying match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have thrown the ball at Kyrgios."
Although he was last seen doing a dust rocket after having muscle cramps and missing a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place individually, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against England.
“One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit drawn into the conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he blamed cramps in the US, but he’s not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know they wouldn’t be proud of it.
But to be serious, he did extremely well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He has a great team, a great family and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a very mature young man of 19 years, he works hard and has integrated into the team, he has had no conflict with other players, he is highly respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in excellent shape, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged on his horses.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important draw match, which begins Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most appropriate for everyone, but supported the long-term return of the Canberra-born player to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the rematch and not think about the controversy around [Kyrgios] at all,” said Healy.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's growing up in front of the public and he's made some terrible mistakes and it's worth being criticized, but we're trying to support him so, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and he's the thing and I think he doesn't need a time in the middle.
2016 Elections: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has been halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is winning ground.
Clinton is now backed by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for president, is backed by 15% of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most Democrat voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton supporters are more steadfast in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS news poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentage points.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has diminished.
Support among the men has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, being now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still at the forefront of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a two-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point lead in this group.
Approximately half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters saying the same about the top rank, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question as to why they would want her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the appropriate experience (16%), followed by the fact that it’s time for a woman to be president (13%), and that she is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible candidacy for the presidency, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race – though one-third think he shouldn’t run.
When asked about the second option for the party’s representative, Democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn’t run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance of winning the general election; however, the figures fell from 78% last month.
Biden is ranked second, but the percentage he is most eligible for has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues to eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered unacceptable by these voters as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in some key features of their party’s primary voters.
The majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trustworthy and to have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters don’t think Clinton is integrity and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% don’t have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, share the same ideologies.
On all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist about the use of a personal email address and server by Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation on the subject and say it has not affected their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on this subject in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
Mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, say they have changed their minds about Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democrats consider Clinton to be an integral and trustworthy figure, this still raises concerns among voters at the general level: only 32 percent consider Clinton to be an integral and trustworthy figure, 8 percent less than last month and 15 percent less than in May.
Sixty-two percent of voters don’t think it’s trustworthy or trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump to be integrity and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be integer is higher than those who are not of the same opinion but, as in Carson’s case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five Brotherhood Members Charged with Killing Student in Year 1 at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at New York's Baruch faculty brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Official sources say the victim was tied to his eyes, put a 14-kg backpack full of sand behind him, and was repeatedly abruptly stabbed as he tried to head for a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call the emergency number after it fainted and claimed to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
But they found time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the nation's fraternity president, to ask for his advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
“At this point, members started hiding personal belongings and practically put the good of the fraternity before the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunks, and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by the brotherhood rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family's lawyer, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable and this action taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury has recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with outrage and complicity in the murder.
"We want to hold not only the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has officially or informally authorized the fraternity, we will also hold it accountable," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch faculty banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises the interest rate.
The interest rate will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
In economics, history offers little clue as to time frame.
After the first interest rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so strongly accentuated the fact that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise, but on the trajectory of the time it takes to normalize.
In fact, there are multiple variables in the game.
However, in the end, market players might find that all the turmoil associated with the interest rate increase has been exaggerated.
“The first interest rate increase decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, anticipating interest rate hikes can volatilize things for a while.
But at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for capital returns to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first rise, which may reflect the monetary policy phase-out again,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed’s rises.
Specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - heading for an increase in the interest rate, quite invariable in the period of 250 days after (average rise of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six years.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate hike cycle and benefits are starting to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life but an increase in the interest rate often contributes to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historic low point for an increase in the Fed’s interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though the value was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching just 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question “if this time it’s different,” Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all year for a growth decision by the Fed, all eyes being on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an interest rate increase on the occasion of this meeting, futures trading indicates a probability of only 25%.
“In our study after 1950, all interest rate cycles so far have been in a super-cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, it was a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the benefits change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate hike cycle, the yield of bonds is immediately declining,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will bring yields closer between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds perform better in such an environment, although “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the estimated drop in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the profitability curve is fairer, the spread of the credit average interest rate has expanded, and volatility has increased – all market features when the Fed tightens policy.
In general, companies that do majority business in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
High-indebted multinationals will suffer because the rise of the dollar will lead to an increase in the price of their products in the global marketplace and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital revenues and stocks with low volatility also outperformed similar companies with a lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the growth of the dollar.
Those who save might also have to gain, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "stupiding"
He says he’s becoming more and more like his opponent.
He also stared at the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the British Awards.
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, stating that this show is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming into" Classic FM, a prominent MP said, putting pressure on the post to prove that he is doing something commercial stations are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public radio station is "foolish" and increasingly resembling its commercial adversary.
“I have the impression that Radio 3 is ‘foolish’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I have the impression that it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also attended the BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different – these are the two examples that come to mind that do nothing but copy what already exists on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC director-general denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anything about classical music I hear on Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
“In addition, I think it’s also important to Radio 3’s commitment to discovering new music and allocating new tracks,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to make more efforts to attract audiences compared to the previous period because the British had less knowledge of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticized at the Culture, Media and Sport Committee meeting for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show – having Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury – be done “in a BBC-specific manner.”
He added that he wants the respective corporation to "find the golden egg chicken in their own yard" next time they launch an entertainment show.
However, he has refused to forbid in the future picking up new seasons of The Voice or spending money that goes on licensing on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August, and the culprit could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, the slowest growth since 2000 has been recorded.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to make purchases.
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November could cause reluctance to spend.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned UK shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the lowest increase since 2000 to date, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the level of growth from the previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told The Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when buyers began using their mobile phones to shop.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do so in various circumstances, such as from the couch.
But now that it stagnates a little, you might notice a decrease (increase).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers crowded in front of computers to grab offers, which led to the collapse of the websites of several retailers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers struggled on chili peppers, could provoke buyers’ reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online rather than go to fashion stores in shopping areas.
After the bin Laden family is sanctioned, Muslims bury victims killed in the collapse of the Mecca crane
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were strolled on the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the crash.
The Minister of Health stated that a total of 394 people were injured as a result of the crane collapse
At the ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane collapsed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who mourned their dead joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead arrived at the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory kept by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial after Saudi Arabia’s king sanctioned the bin Laden family’s construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
In the ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims who were killed in a crane collapsed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi news agency, said the Binladin Group was partially to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not provide the details, but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane crash in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the crane crash and the Group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and not coordinating its work with the weather authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the Saudi royal family and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a “renegade” son, deprived of his family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in strong wind and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities have decided that the relatives of the deceased victims will receive one million Saudi Riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Conversion of Credits to Swiss Francs
In the banking market there have already appeared two offers of conversion in lei of loans in Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when the variable interest rate can lead to an increase in rates.
Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of converting loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data compiled by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest rate of 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, Bank Transylvania’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of clients with loans in francs due to second successive reductions: the balance was reduced with the value of risk and management commissions paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5 % was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to how much they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefit
The main advantage of leu loans in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future increases in the franc, and the repayment of the loan will be made in the currency in which he collects his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no reassessment of the property, no further guarantees are required and another proof of income.
Practically, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and there will be no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a discount on the monthly rate, compared to how much customers paid before the conversion, the equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is formed more of the interest, and the customer pays back very little of the principal.
Bancpost’s offer with very low interest rates in the first three years seems to be advantageous for customers.
It is unclear how this will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, the three-month ROBOR is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached the value of 6%, in 2009 it reached over 15%, and in a few days since 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, there may be other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come to decide on the interest rate for the Federal Reserve.
The world is looking forward to the two-day meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision about whether or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who last week believed that the decision will be made, I now believe that the situation will remain for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event since it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Stars who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia and in 2009, he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of these certainly have a cost.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been on the bar for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg in Manchester United's Champions League match, which ended with a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player’s eyes and will keep him on the line for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident came after an unwise intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital.”
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe after tomorrow, then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, faces difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like that happens.
Her oxygen mask was put in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at the double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's a fault and a red card.
It was a very ugly intervention with two legs.
Shaw tweeted, “Thank you all for the messages, I don’t have words to express how weak I feel, I start the road to recovery, I’ll come back stronger.”
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The England team’s backer has an extra reason to recover to play at the European Championships in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very ugly injury.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never seek to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexican national team against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championships.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I could only see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I could not see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission but still holds fast
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not consider a repeat of the defeat by 3-0 in the test matches.
I wouldn't even eliminate the option of a moving victory.
Perhaps Alastair Cook’s team has less experience than three years ago, but they have good players on the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youth attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth left England for the Tests and was replaced by Alex Hales.
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to consider the decision not to select Adam Lyth for the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by the results.
There were no signs of questioning about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this before - the players are their own pickers.
About fifty years and perhaps Lyth would have prolonged his run but his fate is in his hands.
I hope that if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when performance wasn’t as good as his ability and I’m not surprised; first of all, he’s a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the move.
The only dissatisfaction you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean Tour – when Lyth was in maximum shape – but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is on the team, a batsman I rate very well.
He’s a cricketer who has “factor X” and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open to batting alongside Cook, which would lead to an extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already demonstrated that he's fucked up.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test 38 games as first drop before entering the open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the team on the back-up spinner position and, although I had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People might judge his early age — with an average of 31 at the beat and 35 at the ball — and might think it’s the point, but there aren’t a lot of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
You will learn a lot from this tour.
England has also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master’s blow.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, since he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the tournament’s white-ball leg and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham’s team-mate Ben Stokes is resting for the one-day matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and coaches don’t do the program.
And you have to keep in mind, players’ jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
Brexit Camp Could Have a Cause Gain If Economy Stays Calm Until 2017
As the day goes by, David Cameron’s renegotiation strategy to keep the UK in the EU gets increasingly messed up, even without Jeremy’s choice of “Yes or No?” genius Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
The aliens also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in recent days that – plunged into crises similar to those in the EU – not all of which are domestically provoked – some member states are fueled by the UK’s agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that neither do they want this if it erodes social protection.
We could even call it the “selfie” agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK with a perspective on the outside under the EU roof – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – suggests that many obtuse ministers and officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don’t care if they stay or leave.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is extremely cautious, is an ally but has been at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation shakes up, as happened with 11-year-old Thatcher, 14-year-old Mitterrand and 16-year-old Kohl, who have been at the helm too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to believe that they will help the English posing, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to intentionally make remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "the UK has not obtained anything of value from the renegotiation".
Europeans know on their own how captivating Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic press barons who look at the EU with skepticism are, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
Perhaps they vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a Brussels correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of unpaid handbags, foreigners who cheated on the phone, and pseudo-non-domestics who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same way, but he realized that when you’re locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from thinking of eating you for lunch and again for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairized than Blair in opposition to Cameron’s referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back friendly Monday at Westminster – I told him not to spend time with me anymore – seems in danger of adopting from the egg the Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take a while, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position on the BBC he left vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position towards Europe is what I would indulgently call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who do not agree with the “Anglicism” of the Conservatives might agree with this.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when his researcher struggled not to recognize that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as a "shadow" minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his fellow workers, without going too far and without losing his office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said or what JC told colleagues and parliamentarians at the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey – remember, it also sensitized me – the discipline of messaging remains important in the age of television and especially in the whirlwind of social media, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s fair not to give Cameron a favour ticket to Europe, allowing him to take good care of Labour’s support in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes that.
But McDonnell and Corbyin’s basic sophism about EU membership – consistent with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophism about NATO - Tom Watson is relentless about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin’s political capital – and there are suspicious voters there – be wasted on concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed with the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded of at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticize the decision of the Public Health Department of England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
The editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Public Health Department of England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of evidence.”
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinarily fragile base” on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and their justification “on solid ground or on moving sand”.
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said the PHE claims that “current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” are expected to be based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criterion decision analysis model (MCDA) that synthesized their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell, or claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for conducting an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated the funding received from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that there are reports that it would have received from the cigarette and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them are a few known "frontiers" in the production of e-cigarettes, some of them even declare in the work the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of the PHE.
The group's research work "convincingly masks" the lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have on most criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE claims that "to date there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at PHE, says he has responded in the past to claims in the BMJ.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked all their lives loses their lives because of this addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risk posed by e-cigarettes is comparatively low, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that arises and those that do not arise from evidence, in particular in view of the high degree of public confusion regarding the relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to a smoking-related disease, and the annual costs borne by the national health system due to smoking reach <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion.
By clearly expressing the current evidence – namely that although the use of e-cigarettes is not risk-free, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking – we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Advertisements that embarrass the UK's arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International video against the arms trade fair.
Terrible killer drones!
Beasts for crushing ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause terrible pain without leaving any traces!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms trade fair is a fierce charade, carried out by Amnesty International to underscore the British authorities’ desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at ExCeL Centre in London’s Do’s.
DSEI Arms Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Arrive in London
But a separate campaign has also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
“Important announcement, are you travelling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?” says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London subway, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will crash on the DLR. Customers are asked to contribute to stopping the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their work at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a 6-pound Allen key pack that claims to “facilitate access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stations on the planet.”
The London transport director is not amused by this “vandalism” in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs curator and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and looking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists go on to collaborate with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that welcomes the navigators who travel by subway.
Amnesty’s film had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and voice dubbing artist also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the ad for the arms trade – with an empty space in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with making a more realistic commercial but “enriching it with powerful animations and colors, it was more striking.”
“They did a great job helping us increase interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty International.
Now, it would be necessary for UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the topic of the arms trade comes from inside the ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the U.S. military on “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launchers.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped focus that delivers amazing effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in the Home
It’s been 11 years since I moved into the home, when I was a 19-year-old boy who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I was angry at – and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things I’ve learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving home can bring states ranging from nervous breakdown to horror.
Talking is tempting: to tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year off from your studies, what you think about Corbyn and why "honestly, you don't care about Marmite because, really guys, it's nothing but yeast extract HAHA, find me in my room."
Breathe deeply.
And help others to breathe, too - ask questions and show interest.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate people you like from those you wouldn’t talk to even if the flood came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Bedrooms are often full of parties with drinks, movie evenings and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their underwear.
Related topics: Don’t even think about starting a student life in a relationship
Introverts have special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a haven, but many homes are building a culture of bedroom wandering, based on friendship, socializing and lifelong friendships.
All of this can be awful for someone trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to stay friends but I want you to go and get back the energy I consumed interacting with you.”
Try to notice when a colleague is exhausted from socializing — and try to send an SMS instead of knocking at the door.
When it comes to knocking on the door: do it.
A guy who was sitting in the same home with me had a policy that said that if a door wasn’t locked, then he was invited to come in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends while you cook.
Since you start college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get to know them and you take a plate of blacks, it seems less odd, less like the 50s situation, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked something for you, now smile and I ask personal questions."
Goodies cooked at home are a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to sit and talk and may end up associating your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a skilled cook.
Flour, sugar, and fat flakes will most likely cause others to pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Theft of food is a common crime in student shelters.
Obviously, if you erase someone’s chicken is stealing, but if you take a drop of milk to put in your tea is still stealing?
Ask the owner.
It will probably tell you to serve yourself even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it’s annoying and I understand you—still try to address the problem more maturely than my homemate, who dyed his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
Don’t make noise that doesn’t let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it's common sense, it's because you're actually going on chips.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to slow down the music because it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give the music louder.
When they finally stopped the music at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let her sleep for two hours before starting music at full speed, locked the door and went to the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if the future husband/wife moved on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extremely strange if you confused a palier colleague with your future husband, got married, broke up and should meet each other daily and maybe even see him get along with all the common friends?
Of course, you can’t resist the heart — but if a sexy laymate is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
In the thrilling moment when you realize that someone has left their keys in the unlocked room, the line between cheating and intimidation is thinner than it seems.
A successful farce is funny, but it can be distorted in a few moments.
Teach a funny and valuable safety lesson by hiding something – but never dirty someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer – but don’t glue someone’s goods to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: There were no world tours in Bach’s time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, rightly "strange", as he says himself, Les Dissonances - an orchestra composed of international soloists and talented musicians, which interprets a symphonic repertoire with an aperitif to make a
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when the violinist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu were not missed.
Both performances, held on the Athenian stage, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, at the time being the only classical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They feel like they need a leader.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all the musical fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
So let’s not talk about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on our side, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen, but has to look, which is stupid again,” says David Grimal.
The violinist tells the story that this change in the way he makes music came from the "musical disappointments" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30, I found this very depressing, because I could no longer find human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So I didn't find any way to continue on this path.
So I decided to create The Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one was doing it without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
“How do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego anymore?” asks the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the ensemble's existence, the absence of a conductor did not prove to be a hindrance in the musical act: "In a curious way, the more we sing a more complex repertoire, the easier it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not only in the role", says Grimal.
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", precisely because it also invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world singing 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different that breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu’s work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu’s works in his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal campaigned for a change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the musician's craft, as it is organized today, has a death snare" and that "the future of music is music itself".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it doesn't help.
In Bach's time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example to Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
In order to enter the EU, you had to adopt sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are at the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With music the same thing happens, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances make reds may not be very nice, but when you cut them, they are real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should go back to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as do Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning in school, we would reintroduce the concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical byproducts," Grimal said.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician with a soldier, or whether we form a musician who will play an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier (this education) it must be in a way, if we want to train a musician, it is completely different.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” the French artist asks with a smile.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert there are smiling people".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile of David Grimal
After attending the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, during which time he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris before meeting with Philippe Hirshor.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, along which he has performed regularly in the last 20 years, as well as in the main classical music scenes of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as Orchestre de Paris, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Russian National Orchestra, Orchestre National de Lyon, Orchestre Philernik of Lyon, Chamber New Europe.

In addition to his solo artist career, David Grimal continued to explore more personal projects.
The freedom that his collaboration with Les Dissonances gave him has allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Alongside Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with the homeless at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been an Artist in the Residence at the Opera de Dijon.
He teaches violin at Musikhochschule in Saarbrücken, Germany.
He also holds many masterclasses and was a member of the jury of the Long-Thibaud International Competition in Paris in 2010.
He received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres award from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sang on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by the French luthier Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present at this year’s George Enescu International Festival together with Orchestra Les Dissonances, with Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven in the program.
Les Dissonances also went on stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schneidke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City Searches for "The Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: doubling two characters from the superproduction "The Snow Queen 3D"
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give her a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "The Little Big Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic drawings the emphasis was placed on bringing the voice of the actor closer to the specificity of the animated character, lately, in the creation of the story, those who are to interpret the voices are also considered, and they are usually well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our competition.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the lines are funny.
"Children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11 and September 30, Cinema City organizes a preselection, after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be selected, who will have the opportunity to give a try in a recording studio with professionals.
All the parents have to do is access the platform micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child to the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Next, you have to choose one of the four movies available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will record himself playing his own version of the dubbing.
Four movies about friendship, fairytale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the test: "Yellow Pen 3D", "Mune: The Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala the Known 3D" and "Albino Maya 3D".
Finally, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double one character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - The Snow Queen 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, tax forecasts fall for 2016
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant reducing year-round profit estimates as a result of low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday’s opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts expected the figure to be $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The declining estimate comes despite an average price increase of 4.9%, with entry into force on 4 January and higher surcharges for overland transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said: “The company is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially in terms of global production and trade.”
The contracting plans for the holidays were announced a day after the UPS competitor said it plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of contracts it made last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in Zacks’ survey estimated the total to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, leading to a stagnation in revenue for its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping skipped the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the revenues of the ground division increased by 29%, but operating revenues stagnated virtually due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while revenues recorded by the freight division decreased due to rising costs.
On pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Tuesday at close had fallen by 11% year-on-year and by 17% from the record high on June 11.
At the most anticipated meeting in recent years, policymakers within the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide if it’s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank’s meeting room, will be a mural of the United States.
The map is intended to remind that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s president, and her colleagues must put the nation’s economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the U.S. and maintain price stability.
But since the big economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is an unwritten third task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in an overly difficult-to-anticipate decision to be announced Tuesday, which will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be debated by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in effect from late 2008.
Even though most of the data indicates a strong growing economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the benchmark rate for federal funds — even just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues that will follow,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were to look for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the world market is enough to give them an argument to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the decision the Fed will make, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
Approximately half of recent Bloomberg economists predicted an interest rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers would attenuate the blow by promising that it would take a long time until the next rise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The boom was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers will keep the interest rate steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising if the Fed were to raise the interest rate right now,” Lonski said.
If the Fed’s decision makers did so, “they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets.”
Other experts said an interest rate hike would calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed about to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in the interest rate this year despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Salary gains showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank’s annual target, the Fed’s decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices falling sharply.
The economy “may be able to cope with higher rates and needs them given the labor market tension,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began fibrillating at the end of this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 16% below its record high in May, as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market fell somewhat this month, with the Dow index now about 10% below its peak in May.
For Fed decision makers, market turmoil is added to the complex calculation of the moment of interest rate hike.
“Without what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be more firm in the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a researcher with experience at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former official Fed.
Now, he expects that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and they have almost no data to base on subsequent events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so practically it should not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank’s influence has been huge.
President Ben S. Bernanke’s mere allusion in 2013 that the Fed could “narrow” its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the global economy.
His decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department at wellness management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that “the Fed has a history of overreacting to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic bases.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the interest rate hike, gave as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that has affected Asia has led the Fed to reduce the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the implications with limited identification for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to their respective declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market quake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate commission.
The last turbulent period does not rise far at that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to get into the situation of fearing an interest rate rise because markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not think it should take action prematurely.
Are you looking for a unique Thai-specific marketplace?
Try LAX-C from Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store open/open in 1997 is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/store is a universal type store that offers an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious decorations and festive.
There is also a car park where you need to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to run through all the colors.
If you get hungry from so much bought, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The inner dining area of the store (good, affordable as a price) is close to homes and offers several options of dishes that can be taken to the package.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything- Thai?
You'll probably find it at LAX-C.
The products have reasonable prices and some items are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat radius is large, as is the fish radius - the serving staff will clean and stew the fish and even fry it for you if you want.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer district, where you will find frozen curry leaves, melons and ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef ball, pork carcasses, fish chips, traditional sausages, semi-prepared and many more.
Who buys from there: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individuals.
On the wide colors fit both shopping carts and fork carts.

Where it is: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own common parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although there is a chance that the store will crowd, parking space is usually not difficult to find.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite attempts by Channel Nine to broadcast on the Today Show about the change in party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of Channel Nine aired from the capital after the defeat of Tony Abbott in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The contestant Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of a few weeks, which also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "crossing" of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317,000) and Tuesday’s (283,000) audiences, but the figures were lower than Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap compared to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
At the moment, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all through the morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main news was the amazing debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, with a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson was able to handle a show alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night's hearing answered "yes."
The show X Factor, broadcast by Seven, remained in the spotlight with 1,136 million viewers, taking the spotlight on The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night he aired The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half of the hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in audience recorded by Chase Australia on the second evening will give Nine tacit confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to defeat McGuire’s show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Because he provoked President Vladimir Putin openly, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated, and his pro-democracy efforts were diminished.
Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, some of whom threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal claimed that police forces used tear gas, after which they fired in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent clashes triggered on August 10.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial issue in Nepal, a country centrally governed for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, police and weapons
The Prime Minister continues to exchange replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm position on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or policemen with weapons.
“It’s a shame for Europe in the 21st century to apply methods from the 30s,” said Victor Ponta.
"The Prime Minister also said that all data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and determined at the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC Announces 60% Probability of Cyclone in South Cape Verde
A large low-pressure front about 560 km south of Cape Verde's southernmost point has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60% chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight-loss surgery could be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be sustained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those following non-surgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of measurement of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data gathered after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery – gastric bypass and gastrectomy in the sleeve – in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in people who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments for diabetes remained nearly at the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes cured completely at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes completely cured only 1% and partially cured only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
But this improved “glycemic control” – reflected by improved levels of hemoglobin A1c – did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with gastrectomy in the sleeve, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 vs 2.1 %).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on high-weight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona, Phoenix School of Medicine.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic look for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
“This is where this work is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” without the increased risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously when the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to urge people to take this issue seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it’s extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not welcome all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call to end the violence in the refugee mother countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Oxford Dalai Lama Center for Compassion, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirably, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we must think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush after the 9/11 terror attacks, saying that the violent response on the part of the US generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 9/11, we sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without calling for violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Four times the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, U.S. anti-poison centers have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who swallowed high-alcohol hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Anti-Poison Center in Georgia, cases of hand detergent intake in children under the age of 12 reported at anti-poison centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children intentionally drink detergent and others do so to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube you can watch movies that show teenagers how they drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It turns out that teenagers mixed the mouthwash detergent with alcohol to get a hotter drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
“A child doesn’t think he’s hurting them,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are the perfumed ones.
Hand detergents with a aroma of strawberries, grapes, orange are the most attractive for children.
Hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poison center at the University Hospital of Kansas, to the Kansas City Fox Channel 4.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four strawberry-scented hand detergent sprays at school, reached the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcoholemia 179 times the threshold at which an adult is legally considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah moaned and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage as the girl fell and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was frightening,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to him.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic damp products or napkins and not to leave the detergent at the fingertips of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher by “putting antibacterial products in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in her classroom.
Police deemed the plan "insignificant" and referred the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

ADAM Rooney's first-round penalty brought Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, with the Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismantles rumors of misunderstandings
There have been rumors of misunderstandings at Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team should not be subjected to increased pressure given that they are preparing to face the Dutch league leaders.
I don’t think we feel the pressure, I think the players are looking forward.
The absence of the Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic - because they didn't fight for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax’s ambassador, said: “In the Netherlands, I no longer transmit the Celtic’s match summary; why?”
Because the Rangers aren't there.
It’s not just about the return of the Rangers.
We are talking about Old Firm.
We talk about both teams together and that’s where the interest goes.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and it’s not just the Scots who want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic is fighting hard but the Norwegian boss has promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now at the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, “The Celts have had periods before and will come back.”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way, but we have to move on.
We need the support of the Celtics because that’s how the players get better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's prudence on January transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago that suggested he would have identified several targets for January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn’t want to affect the Ibrox team’s unit.
The former head of Brentford said: “The January transfer period is very different from the summer one.”
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is a pre-season period in which they can be integrated, which you may have noticed this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players that are not needed.
Celtic targets Michu after retirement
The striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw at the end of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled with ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faces SFA over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the backbone's red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting, “I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
Invincible Hibee was picked up after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh ahead of a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was a derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding, "I don't need to say I won't go back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Board Trusts Dundee United Management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still believes the management team will change the situation – but agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We’ll get the boys back in shape,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for 'dirty victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must desperately stick with Hamilton Accies to get their seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic due to Adam Rooney’s first-round penalty kick.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and that hasn't won matches like that."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as UK rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, at 164,000 in May-July, while the number of UK unemployed per total rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that of the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 in the three-month period, with the number currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0%, a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term plan of the authorities has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the Scottish labour market, employment rate rising and unemployment falling.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will look at how a man is condemned to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit in an observation room at Oklahoma State Penitentiary and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I am terrified of the idea.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
True, journalists can witness executions in America and, because applications usually exceed the number of available seats, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The elected will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, in addition to developing my own connection with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The penitentiary authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to have a notebook and a pencil to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he “could have formulated it better,” but he still thinks he is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write and I wouldn’t do it even if he asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants to have an international report to write on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of media files we made.
I won't come back here in all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I don't think there is enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I will watch him die from this perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you will learn what it's like to watch a man who likes dying uselessly.
Peter Moody claims that the stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from the races
Peter Moody claimed that the stewards of Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy into his stalls last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the races.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, stating that they are conducting a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the cup being the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment given on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing field and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari’s cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about the statements about the spies and did not want to resemble "the wolf that does not reach the grapes".
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that, and I’ve been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything suddenly buzzes,” Moody said.
It is known that he continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to endure the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have declared.
Tonight I'm going home and I'm going to sleep quietly.
I want to go head-up and I want the owners I work with to see that I’m striving to give them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up the job of a trainer.
At that point, I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he stated that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stalls.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man — whose name I’ll tell him if I’m asked — and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody said.
Obviously, he considers me a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can hold people accountable outside trainers for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that’s how the others see it.
Maybe they need to take my license and put me aside and I have no doubt that the statements they are making right now might cause them to think about this variant.
But I have come to the point where I don’t care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on them and get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration grew with the lengthy cobalt testing investigation involving Lidari and his elimination prompted him to say he could "put his license on the table."
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training the undefeated Black Caviar champion, labeled the race day treatment rule as "ridicule" after a mud or clay cataplasm was applied to the horses' feet, breaking the rules.
You're breaking the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could've happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and that's what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on the day of the race consisting of applying the cataplasm, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but it has gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran away from the crash site in Cobram has been arrested.
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by the escape from the crash site.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he was seriously injured after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Highway.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of fleeing from the scene of the accident, failing to offer first aid and other road crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling allegations.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's scoring tactics as "distorted subjects" brought into question by the NRL's top two favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees have allowed Storm players to "take their team's torch" in Storm's nervous win in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and declared that the two of them were not competing.
Bellamy jumped in defense of his team's scoring tactics and said players simply focused on "contact" when they liked it.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticized his team, meaning they were worried that Storm would defeat them.
"And things don't stop here - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, only that in the last six weeks we have really put the focus on contact in the tiles and thus changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he is probably not used to losing and it was a shock for him.
It’s funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett's winning the championship in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about thrilling football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was.
I remember in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because it was a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care about black under nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider exciting football, especially because of the fast young midfielders.
This is the kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they are saying these things because they are somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they thought about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between the Storm and the Roosters was a tougher match related to the score compared to the match between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven’t seen it yet, what was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, does that mean exciting game?
Or is it exciting to take breaks and not walk?
There are plans for me.
If they're talking about us, it means we could meet them at some point.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the finals next Saturday at AAMI Park, with tickets on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used girls' phones to get paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent pictures with children as the subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the phone disappeared, which she found in Hogg’s hand while he was sleeping.
He looked at the phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
After arriving, police saw the five photos and then looked at computers found at the address and found “worrisome” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to “attract pedophiles” on the Internet before “pretending to be a cop to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the court in Dundee: “He has stated that it is an addiction – that it is addictive to scare people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to pose as a cop to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and the fact that he asked that person to send him other photos.
He said he did it to seduce.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and that he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the indecent pictures on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused was using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, 23, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the allegations that he had taken or taken indecent pictures of child subjects, and violated the conditions of parole on January 25 this year and did not appear in court on March 24.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim called for Hogg not to be registered as a sex offender because it could be said that the crime “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentence until October due to social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was entered in the sex offenders register before the sentence was given.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe delivered the wrong speech in parliament
Earlier this year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
There were no injuries, but the shooting of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed to have received anonymous death threats, threatening to somehow evade Mr Mugabe during his speech.
He was humiliated last month during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, warning not to disrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is titled 'death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the threats it had sent to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 redundancies
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company’s efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year, HP will split on the stock exchange into two companies, separating the computer and printer divisions from operations with fast-growing corporate hardware and services.
The planned rollouts will cost around $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-effective structure,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP currently and will have a broad business portfolio that will help companies transition to the new business style,” Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions” addressed to companies.
It splits a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the object of which was the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley cradle".
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction are performing better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men peaking in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wishing to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle for the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” his chances of recovery are doubled.
Likewise, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halve the likelihood of developing mental disorders.
Of course, in order for friendship to have effect, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediate character of the response often takes precedence over contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and successful, even if in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values—our inner desire for personal development and friendship—that profoundly affect our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn’t even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it drew attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments they watch football in comfortable armchairs, and Ross’s passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role of listening to people who are suicidal and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who call us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to handle yourself alone is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer several long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, external intervention, through the phone, helps people who arrive in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you are attending this weekend at FriendsFest hosted by Comedy Central, with the full playback of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG put Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG to make it to the Swedish team Malmo.
Below we present you the chronicle of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group series, with a relaxing 2-0 win against Malmo in the match played Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his Champions League debut in the PSG team, taking the French champions to the edge although they missed a number of opportunities before securing their lead with Cavani's goal in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify for the best but also to improve the path to the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
But despite taking the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the opportunity of goal after which he was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or on the move in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference from the next ranks, even if there are still things we need to improve over the season,” Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw scored by Bordeaux at home in League 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took over the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the offensive midfielder from Argentina was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he bumped into Marco Verratti's lap behind Malmo's defense before jumping unbelievably over Johan Wiland in the long right corner.
But if anyone was expecting PSG to win by pounding their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team titles, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic, who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
PSG players, on the other hand, slowed the pace several times, giving some unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts only in the first half and was then replaced by Cavani just after the game resumed.
However, Ibrahimovic proved to be much more skilled in supporting his teammates, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a shot deviated by Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in the final after an hour of the game, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from the center of Maxwell.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hopes of rebalancing the score and only a superb stop from Wiland's distance to reject David Luiz maintained the final score before new entrant Ezequiel Lavezzi cancelled a goal in extensions.
Malmö Norwegian coach Age Hareide later said that PSG were with a class over and that "the last game I played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, I have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Put down your hat for PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion from share sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodity exchange, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a broad-based debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold new shares worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is picking up with falling prices on the commodity exchange, because China's decline in economic activity is influencing demand and causing disaster in markets.
The preferential subscription right raised the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trades.
Stocks rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings on the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of its broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than Tuesday’s closing price.
It removed 1.3 billion shares from the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the growth of the Chinese economy, which is in prolonged stagnation, led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi urges broader expansion of global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needed to open up to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving opening policies," Xi said at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and give way to economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganizing the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying the sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a regulatory-based business environment and providing wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
According to the statement, China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be open to private investment.
“State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called ‘green books’, optimising requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right to practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions dissatisfied with government’s proposal to increase wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the education unions did not reach any result, with the government proposing a 10% wage increase from 1 December with pay on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase from November, or one of 20%, from December.
The discussions took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the Prime Minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The Government’s proposal today did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to summon the leaderships of our federations.
The 10 percent that we were promised today is less than we expected.
“In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the government last year for 2016,” Alma Mater president Anton Hadar said at the end of the talks.
In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have.
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI, in which representatives of the Government will also participate to present to the representatives of the confederations of the country the proposal of salary increases, after which the unionists will decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The prime minister also told unionists that the government was trying to send the salary bill to Parliament as soon as possible so it could come into force on December 1.
The normative act provides for an increase in salaries in the education system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the increase provided in the document to be made escalonado, in the next four years.
Also, Victor Ponta promised the unionists to pay in full the court sentences in 2016.
Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday after the boat in which they were washed up.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it had managed to rescue 249 people who were in the shipwreck, but their nationality was not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people were killed while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also over the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometers off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has become a popular route lately for immigrants who want to get rid of war and hard life in countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired for being too fat
Air India is firing about 130 stewardesses because they are overweight, the airline said at the end of last week.
The state-owned company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics said the move was "ridden" and "shockingly sexist."
The mass redundancies are the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and the busier stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began to use graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the nine stewardesses considered "exceptionally overweight" because this "may have an effect on reflexes and may prevent the agility necessary to carry out emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were re-employed, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to cause them to lose weight have failed," a company spokesman said.
A footballer from the Star gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision he made
A footballer from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali regarding the promotion of young players.
If the champion’s funder decided to close the Football Academy where he had invested a considerable amount, founder Paul Papp opened a football school.
The Paul Papp Academy will operate in the city of Dej, with the village deserters waiting for a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to give the start to the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry about the material in training.
They have only one concern: to play football as well as possible.
Technical details don’t have to be their concern.
They have to value their talent.
This is what the Football Academy 'Paul Papp' wants to do.
“I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he is with them,” Papp told Dejeanul.ro.
At the Academy of the founder of the Star are expected children up to 11 years old.
The whole party wants to rule.
Interim PSD President Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the entire party wants to remain in government, and if the Prime Minister wants to, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize through a Congressional decision, we will do the same.
There won't be any emotion about it.
"There have been no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that give someone the uncertainty of the government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the National Permanent Bureau of the PSD.
PSD has announced when it will make a congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday it was important for the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, to give a clear message if it wants to continue the government or if the party decides to move into the opposition.
Dragnea: I'll announce Monday if I'm running for a post in Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position in the future Congress.
I will sing, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is also set.
"I will announce whether I will be a candidate for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD's National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation about announcing the candidacy was related to his file, Dragnea said he does not have this problem.
I do not have the problem you are referring to, but it seems to me fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to notify me of a candidacy when the date of Congress is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The overwhelming majority of the social-democratic branches proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party's Executive Committee.

An Italian was caught at Customs Bors with migrants hidden in TIR
Two Sri Lankans were spotted Monday at Bors Customs as they tried to illegally cross the border, hiding in the semi-trailer of an automarfar led by an Italian citizen.
Following the investigations, it was determined that the two had paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the Border Police reported.
At the specific checkpoint, the border police noticed a large travel bag in the truck cabin, which contained personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a detailed check on the means of transport.
On this occasion, the border police discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the car, among the plastic crates, two male people.
The verifications revealed that the persons in question, two men, aged 28, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
"In the research, the young people said they intended to arrive in France, which is why they contacted a co-national, through which they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport him to his destination, where he would receive 2,000 euros per person," the statement from the Border Police said.
The two migrants were charged with “criminal work under the guise of committing the crime of attempting to fraudulently cross the state border.”
Pompeo B., a 45-year-old Italian citizen who was driving a Renault Magnum-branded car, registered in Romania, carrying plastic bags for a company in Italy, was detained for 24 hours, after being presented to the Bihor Tribunal with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied are the Romans in the couple: Men versus women
Most of the Romans are happy with their relationship.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents said they were “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the overall quality of the relationship.
“However, 18% appear to be ‘usually dissatisfied’ and ‘very dissatisfied’ in the couple’s relationship, and another 18% declare ‘appropriate,’” the study concludes, according to a statement released Tuesday.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% are satisfied, 17% are appropriate, 6% are very dissatisfied and 8% are slightly dissatisfied.
As for women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the appropriate category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we notice that men are more satisfied.
With regard to the neutral state (correctly), we see a difference of two percent.
"Even in the very unsatisfactory situation, the biggest difference is in the slightly unsatisfactory response where we see a difference of 6 percent," the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or even less time together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also say that "Romans feel the need for something more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, self-control 14%, importance 1%, learning 12%".
The study was done by Extreme Training in the period June 1-1 September on 1,369 people, the calculated margin of error is 2.6%.
Europe is once again in a state of shame.
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe had "shamed itself" after Monday's failure of the Brussels ministerial meeting on the allocation of refugees within the European Union.
"Last night, Europe was once again embarrassed," Sigmar Gabriel, who is also the economy minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, told AFP.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested reducing the EU's structural funds in countries that reject refugee quotas.
European interior ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday, failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory distribution of 120,000 refugees, a request last week by the European Commission to deal with one of Europe's worst migration crises since 1945.
He was mayor for only half an hour.

What Happened to Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, having to choose whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year in the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with the romance only at major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise to Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself in front of the capricious sportswoman.
The Adidas program will end at the end of this year, and Halep will have to decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or quit.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We talk and we see.
"After Singapore, I will be able to give an answer," Simona said at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive tennis coaches to date, demanding a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession that he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last event that Simona and Cahill will work together is the Singapore Championship Tournament.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he separated from the Romanian national team last fall.
The former selector confessed that he did not agree with the FRF president, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but was refused.
Right now, I'm not sorry I left the national team.
Then I'm sorry, I'm leaving a job behind.
So I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, my work was not respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he did not know me, he learned different opinions from the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his mind.
But I wanted to leave.
If they wanted me to stay, I offered them an extension of the contract.
We have around 400 and some thousands of euros per year, we were going to have around 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burlean, I talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Blinds and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia, after violent clashes over the course of Wednesday, when water and tear gas guns were used against immigrants who wanted to penetrate from Serbia, despite the fact that Hungary was ridiculous.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far, 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has taken two children who were injured after they were thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means," Hungarian Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi's security adviser said.
The police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas the crowd of people throwing with plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that dozens of migrants broke the fence at the crossing between the cities of Roszke and Horgos and managed to penetrate the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants from the common border.
There are reports that Serbs have also supplemented their border security forces.
Following the incidents on Wednesday, Budapest suspended the border crossing from Roszke-Horgos for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted effort to close its borders in order to halt the entry of migrants.
If on Tuesday he announced that next to the cord fence on the border with Serbia he will raise one on the border with Romania, towards the vehement protests of Bucharest on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the lifting of a fence and on the border with Croatia.
A rare disease that a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was sick, he could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he had not consumed alcohol, it was evident that he was in a state of drunkenness.
When she first accused me of being drunk, without being drunk, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought, 'Maybe he's drinking alone, he's an alcoholic in secret,'" he said.
When he saw his wife's footage with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply did not recognize himself: "I was looking into my eyes and I wasn't there."
"It was horrible, I didn't remember anything."
In addition, his wife, who, although doubting him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled like alcohol.
The moment Nick was most excited about was when, after a minor accident, when he had been hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcoholemia three times above the legal limit, although the night before he had consumed only one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was found that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, your body makes all the carbohydrates you consume ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected that this might be Nick's disease was his wife.
The disease has no cure yet, but since he gave up carbohydrates, Nick hasn’t had any such episodes.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cross
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he had received from his dealer.
The man “attacked” his car with a golf club, causing enough damage to get the car out of service.
The entire scene was filmed, and the video reached the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and that of his family.
His fault occurred when the dealer from whom he bought the car did not solve his problem, as he had agreed.
On Wednesday, the government approved the "National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through in efforts to modernize the immigration management process on the national territory", according to a press release.
The strategy aims to effectively manage the immigration phenomenon, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action directions that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are considered for the unitary and coherent management of situations determined by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants into the territory of Romania, generated by crisis situations of a political, social, economic or military nature.
"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will pay special attention to citizens coming from countries with migration potential or that may affect national security," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reviving the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the neighbouring areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more stringent controls of the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal and restrictive measures, the improvement of the national system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access on the territory of Romania to third-country nationals who respond to the needs of employment of the labour force, facilitating access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers it to be “a means by which concrete activities are established that lead to the creation of a flexible system for stopping the growing migration phenomenon”.
Romania, in a European top in terms of the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria saw the strong increase in total labour costs among EU member states in the second quarter of the year compared to the similar period in 2014, according to data published Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to the expenditure on employers’ staff.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total labour cost rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania ranks third in the EU to increase labour costs
The highest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where labour costs per hour fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania in the period April - June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labour in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labour cost.
The activity report of the TVR management, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
Parliament's culture committees on Wednesday rejected the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
For the rejection of the report, 17 MPs voted, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the meeting of the Permanent Bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary session will be held.
“I think that given this situation it will be done relatively quickly,” said Georgia Severin, president of the Senate Culture Committee.
He added that "it was common sense" that the TVR leadership would be present at this meeting, given that no representatives of the TVR leadership were present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was a good feeling to have the TVR leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to CA members last night, about an hour ago that we didn’t even know the time, but today, after the meeting of the meeting of the Bureaux, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting it.
I believe that when you are summoned, you are a budget employee, paid from public taxes, and you are summoned to a meeting of the assembled committees even if you do not like it alive.
"Because it is your duty to serve, you are in an institution subordinate to Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the committees of Parliament's culture.
He added that the meeting discussed the financial aspects of the institution on the basis of the negative opinion of the budget committees.
The debts we saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year they would have been up to date, but they did not pay off from the historical ones.
"I will remind you that it is not my fault or that of any of these committees that we have lost that leisure with the banks and with the tax, these are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the report of activity will be rejected by the plenary meeting, there will be elections for a new Board of Directors, which will elect the general director of the institution.
I don’t know who will be proposed for this position.
Miracles will not be done.
It is important to make political decisions in order for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will sit in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote, will choose with great reason the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what is going on there, who have experience and who have a lot of fairness and respect for institution and tradition.
I don’t know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities it should have – I feel good about the attitude towards employees because it’s a bunch of petitions that come from employees, complaints, redundancies.
"When you get such 50, 60, 70 cases, something is rotten and we're talking about the financial situation which is a disaster," the president of the Senate Culture Committee concluded.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, the president-general director of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he demanded that Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of the public television.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to indexing the TV tax, the amendment and supplementation of HG 978/2003 on the public television service tax, with a view to updating the provisions at the level of technological changes, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on control in the field of payment of the TV tax and the detection of infringements and the application of penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision that extends the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv’s commissioners for the collection of TV tax, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission from receipts.
Stelian Tanase demands the reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also the amendment of law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility to receive budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sporting events.
He argues that SRTv will become insolvent in the coming months given that labour legislation obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not final, and wage rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has consistently made efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.
"Thus, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News station was closed," the president said in a letter.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by his own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - the Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to fulfil its public mission," the letter said.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to trial
Vasile Blaga’s son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial Wednesday by prosecutors of the Public Prosecutor’s Office next to the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a file with damages of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, together with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigations showed that, for the purpose of deducting taxes and taxes from the state budget, representatives of a security company would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been revealed.
“In fact, in the company’s accounting, fictitious purchases of services would have been recorded, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros,” the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Sheikhs have determined the fate of Sanmartean
Al-Ittihad's team has decided the fate of midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean’s departure from Ittihad is imminent, Ladislau Boloni’s entrepreneur, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays title match match and does it well.
The Sikhs also realized that he is the best and that they would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, such as with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has come to fruition," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu has been elected Vice President of the Court of Auditors
The plenary of Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, there were 290 votes "for" and 108 "against".
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reports.
The Liberals have criticized Sarbu’s appointment and announced that they will challenge him at the CCR, given that he has a DNA file but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD senator will hold the position of vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, which remained vacant after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found him unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is about to play the role of a cook in the movie "Burnt", the actor has made a revelation that his fans weren't expecting.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: “I’ve worked much of my life as a cook.”
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since the age of 15, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so his whole childhood cooked with Italian grandmother, ContactMusic reports.
Asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of person to make plans for five years, “not even two.”
"It's not motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things that you would laugh at if I told you," he said, but said that what he had wanted since childhood had come true.
At the age of 40, the actor acknowledged that he would be directing in the near future, taking the role of Clint Eastwood, who had been directing at that age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Wednesday strongly condemned Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's claims that the political decision-makers in Hungary are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, is messing with the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost his support in Romania's domestic policy," the head of the Hungarian diplomacy said.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges that come from Hungarian government representatives.
"These are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!"
The Romanian prime minister added that he is in favour of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, noting that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Scarletness, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem – they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, political decision-makers are nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these goals and values!"
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described as "simple lies" the remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Hungary's management of the refugee crisis, stating that these statements are inappropriate for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister's "extremist and false remarks" are about the internal political crisis in Romania and said Budapest awaits apologies from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have always said and say is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, they are Medieval fools and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with the bat and with the serial.
"I do not agree with this," the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government had decided to start preparations on the ground for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia, in order to face a possible change of the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to lift a fence at the border would solve nothing of the refugee problem and "bring Hungary out of Europe".
What is the link between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Meccan crane?
Saudi authorities said the Saudi-owned Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, was "partially responsible" for the crash of a crane on Friday at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, killing 107 people.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company has not "complied with the safety rules", the Saudi news agency (SPA) reported.
The company’s directors have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation in this case is completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of the Grand Mosque, in order to be able to host more pilgrims.
The crash occurred Friday night during a storm when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong winds, collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque of Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi closed the mouths of the protesters
Considered by many to be the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi has been labeled, after his retirement, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform in the new posture.
After unhappy experiences at the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he patronizes.
After a fixed year of taking over the team, King has demonstrated his ability to turn a team struggling to save from relegation into a top one.
Thus, after a year, Viitorul recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team that competes in the European Cups.
Things took an even better turn for Futuro this season, as the team came in second place in Liga 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and lately in the starting team appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The policy of the club has made the Future a team to follow for teams abroad, so this summer Hagi sold 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Next to the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but then you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the board of directors of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely policing means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we cannot turn history back.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best we can and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are at an extremely emotional time, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council which, in fact, has solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the predictions said he would have the necessary votes.
Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity was applied in the JAI and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, is applied, and the Council approves it with a vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it is a sensitive issue, there have been rejection reactions even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel’s opening policy and they did not want it to appear in many countries as a reaction like “the EU sends migrants on our heads”.
They have therefore delayed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governess and we will probably see big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece’s border with Turkey is also Germany’s border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps it will give up the Dublin principle that migrants are the responsibility of the state they enter for the first time, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece capsizes, you can’t say indefinitely that it’s Greece’s business.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, sharing mechanism of the reception effort?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they will be reached.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think the European states will take the migrants up: you go to country X or country Y.
It is likely that there will be unique filtering centres in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
We are working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the current xenophobic.
The truth is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave, winter is hard to pass the Mediterranean, but we expect next year a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer look at it as catastrophic from a media point of view.
Talk about countries with more or less experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from a non-European culture?
I'm looking at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
It remains an unincorporated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, and the UK.
But purely police means will not work.
Let's create a stronger Europe and illusory.
We need to move towards integration mechanisms in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We have to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take over the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
But the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there is an intervention in Syria, which I don’t believe, it doesn’t mean that the country will be restored overnight and you can take it back.
Until there are solutions, we see strongholds within Europe.
Borders are closed, walls are erected, border controls are reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such is not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where these migrants first set foot.
I mean, we move freely from there, but everyone's got their own problems.
In the face of such a wave, you can't do that, because some countries don't do it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run it doesn’t change much.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It is a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it’s so unstable from week to week that you can’t make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of belligerent statements from politicians at home under the pressure of being virile.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don’t think the Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played in this crisis so far?
Like a small country, which thinks that if it pulls the plug on its eyes and closes its ears, the subject disappears.
Faced with the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it’s not your small country problem.
We have done this, it is a legitimate strategy, but after that you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romanians for Schengen will greatly decrease.
President Iohannis says maybe it's good that we haven't already entered.
So we're moving from a desperate entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen that migrants see us as an alternative route.
Which does not mean that there is a reason not to enter Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become joint responsibility, there will be unique rules for accepting migrants, unique rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two focuses, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated behavior of power.
She believes that being powerful means confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
For about two years it was a struggle between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias, backed by Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you are great power only if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to gain time.
Probably Putin is waiting for offers to be made to him, to press the buttons to resolve the situation.
Offers don’t come because the world isn’t convinced that he can sort of solve all the issues he created.
But I do not agree with the theories that these people are led by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the “Like” button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, that of “Dislike”.
Mark Zuckerberg, the company's co-founder and CEO, announced on Tuesday that the button will be available soon, the New York Times reported on its blog.
Zuckerberg said the "Dislike" button will show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his ad raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg has mentioned that he wants to avoid moments when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long demanded the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said it was not very comfortable for people to “like” current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a family member’s death.
“You may not feel comfortable to like that post,” the Facebook representative said.
The new Facebook button has not been well received by everyone.
“There is enough hate on Facebook and social media already,” Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan said on the New York Times’ Facebook page, where the article was posted.
"I'm going to give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, said there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it’s hard to imagine a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees arrived in Hungary in 24 hours.
Hungary on Tuesday accepted only 70 migrants, a handful of thousands coming into mass at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the influx of refugees, shutting down a main border crossing point and announcing it will build a fence on its border with Romania.
The move delayed a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Before the imposition of the new immigration law, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa also entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council stands to fall.
Two companies in insolvency
Massive investments made here in recent years in order to move the institution are collapsing because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into bankruptcy during the work.
The seat of the County Council on Vasile Alecsandri Street will collapse on its own.
A year and a half after the building’s consolidation and redevelopment work was due to be completed, the work did not even reach half.
A final stage in the epic of the building was consumed last days, when the National Dispute Resolution Council (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract for the realization of the technical project for the works still to be executed.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company was to update the technical project and then organize a new auction for the works.
"The negotiations were not concluded by a contract, however, CJ considered that the proposed form would be disadvantageous to the institution," said R<0xC4><0x83>zvan Timofciuc, representing public relations at CJ.
The CJ decision to suspend direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it, as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNSC decision to the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of it can be considered to find another designer.
Thus, the building’s consolidation work could be resumed no earlier than next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on the consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Corps began in 2011.
A first contract of works was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The tender was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei were made.
The work has so far been carried out in a proportion of about 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, refurbishment and attic of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"Ready, I say it all!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file from the Cadastre Office signed an agreement on acknowledgment of facts, against deferred imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, headed by former head, Narciza Nedelcu
An adviser from the Office of Registry and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Ia<0xC8><0x99>i accused of DNA in a corruption file admitted his telefap.
The agreement on the recognition of facts signed by Dumitru Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was registered yesterday at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Tribunal, the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was accused of false intellectual in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in arrears with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
As for the facts imputed to Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu, the prosecution stated that it was not in the form of a contract.The prosecution said that it was not in the form of a contract.The prosecution said that it was in the form of a consultant of the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "fakely drafted several minutes of acceptance, when selling the contracts for services in the previous keys by O.C.P.I.
In the past days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to trial in this file, the accusations being the settlement of services to the mentioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
Before the trial exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
According to the President of FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women’s national handball team for the qualification for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for the Romanian women's national handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for this they must go through two stages of caudine forks, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two masseuses, a goalkeeper coach, a physical trainer, a head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualification for some things, more precisely material for physical training, which we have never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympics, and I'll do everything I can to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the Stone Age with preparation.
“The teams we fight with have these materials and have had them for some time,” said Dedu, who said he was trying to get the amounts needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is shameful to be questioned for a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let’s not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic districts were built entirely within a two-year span.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona there was a garbage pit, and now it has become a beauty landmark.
The same thing happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Ga<0xC8><0x9B>u went civilized with a project, the people gave their consent in principle, but they quickly realized that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them that we want to, that we are able to organize and they said that they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we talk concretely.
“So we have the whole opening, both at EHF and IHF, but we don’t have the infrastructure,” the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all the coaches to be reserved in forecasts, that if they do not fulfill they will turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players debut on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all components of the Romanian lot are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where he hopes to achieve two victories: "We are ready".
Both I and my colleagues are with the engines at maximum speed.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.

All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let’s take it easy, first with France and then we’ll see.
But if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the crowning of so many years of work.
I don’t want to disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania national team coach Lynn Howells, who has had his first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I am sure that the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me it is an extraordinary experience.
It is very important for me to make the Romanians proud of the national team at every game.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitra<0xC5><0x9F>, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made to the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These guys started playing in the Romanian teams around the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who set out to realize a dream," Dumitra<0xC5><0x9F> said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, having scheduled the following matches: with France, on September 23 in London; with Ireland, on September 27 in London; with Canada, on October 6 in Leicester; with Italy, on October 11 in Exeter.

14 million lei donated to the Hospital "Sf. Spiridon" in Iasi for the correction of the budget
What will be purchased with this large amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budgetary correction, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in modernization and arrangement of clinics, but also in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomography computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds equipped accordingly, an ophthalmic microscope and other devices necessary for conducting the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and layout of the "Great Ars".
From the money from the budget correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main tronson.
“In addition, in the coming days we will be receiving work from the walkway linking the UPU to the clinics of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology to ensure the decent transport of the patient from the UPU to neighboring clinics,” the manager of the medical unit explained.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tatarasi, which will be organized in the outpatient clinic, in the same form under which it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergology, hematology and endocrinology are located in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.
The shed, made a mockery of RATP controllers and a flyer.
P<0xC4><0x83>t<0xC4><0x83>nia of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
In my experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to walk in your city again.
Inadvertently, they were hit by the misinformation in the leaflets, the insensitivity of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The spouses arrived in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist leaflets.
They also received a leaflet in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited Ia<0xC8><0x99>u.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.
Since there was no ton of tickets at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they can take a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the leaflet, they boarded a bus and tried to send SMS following the instructions on the leaflet.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said the service had been out for two years and that it had been announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
How do I know what was written in the local press, I come with a night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation to them, they said they don't care, it's not their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all they can do is give us one fine instead of two (my wife and I).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day of visiting the gendarmerie stand and giving statements there!", says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined for misinformation on the leaflet and the controllers who “applied the law to blood.”
It's not fair, and I did a seizure at RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It's not about money, I'm not exaggerated by many, but the point is that I felt cheated.
Ghinion for violators in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the seven violators from Vaslui has moved, since yesterday, to the Court of Appeal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
The judges judged the first trial in a non-public hearing in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old woman called for their release.
Before the very beginning of the hearing, one of the outgoing judges to whom the file had been allocated, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstinence, which was admitted by his colleagues in the court.
The magistrate has been active until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the president of the Pe nale Section, he being the one who, on April 9, admitted a challenge formulated by four of the accused, ordering their placement in house arrest.
Currently, the case is judged by a complete of which are the magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier in the case, Judge Dan An Ton also made an abstention on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubine relationship with one of the violators’ lawyers.
The two judges decided that the violators of Vaslui should remain in preventive detention.
These blacks will remain in prison for at least another 30 days, when the judges will reconsider the possibility of their release.
The next trial will take place at the Court of Appeal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Court of Appeal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, the van with which the violators from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in the P<0xC4><0x83>curari district, the car entering Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on the belt.
The Iveco truck carrying the seven rapists hit a Volks Wagen that had left Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van runs from the end of P<0xC4><0x83>curari.
The car entered Ia<0xC8><0x99>i here because the employees of the Prison Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on to Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They shortened the road by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the detainees’ escort called for another transport to take over the detainees.
Soon, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i maximum security prison, which took over the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the nile cars, and the arrestees came out in speed, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of their vehicles were friendly about the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner M<0xC4><0x83>d<0xC4><0x83>lin <0xC8><0x9A><0xC4><0x83>ranu of the IPJ.
The Great Migration
Romania is not and will not be ready for what comes next.
But Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and clearly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize represent, in itself, a negligible number, but huge in comparison with the Romanian state’s ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants actually agree to settle in our localities, the chances of integrating them quickly into Romanian society are extremely small.
I am sure they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized by interlopers and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make modern roads, kindergartens or schools, provide decent medical care, collect street misery, create honorably paid jobs or preserve their own young generation.
Why would refugees move to another country from which they are fleeing?
But what produces a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are struck first by the belligerent hypocrisy of the strong EU states, which show utmost generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably because he's afraid of stealing his nationality.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for their departure, do not accept a destination of exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be ridiculed.
Causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, demand peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even, from time to time, some foreign capital enters the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchored, divided and outdated construction.
I complained that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here is that the EU does not have any plans for the future.
Improvisations and threats don’t help.
What, then, does the EU still benefit if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be questioned because of the waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what is to come.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, practically, imposed
The auction for concessions shall be for a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the courtyard of the Museum of Romanian Literature is offered by the County Council for concession for a duration of 10 years.
The construction has a useful area of 134 sqm, on two rough levels.
CJ accepts only the literary cafe, library or other cultural activities as the building's destination.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting price of the auction is 6,830 euros per year, with a bidding step of 25 euros.
The dealer will have to continuously and permanently operate the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitation of the property, in accordance with the technical project to be prepared.
"The Pogor Club building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public catering unit operated in these spaces and even after its evacuation, no ongoing repair and maintenance work was carried out as is currently necessary during the operation of a building," the document said.
The club’s concession offers are expected until September 18.
Two brothers from Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-olds, 11-year-olds from Tomesti, brothers, swallowed several pills of Diazepam.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were rushed to the St. Mary's Hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
They are in stable condition, as the doctors say.
Exclusive: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20, he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the fog of the 1990s, when she was only two months old, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years in which adoption was vaguely regulated, a young outgoing, now a blonde and beautiful girl who was born again.
Crina will be 20 years old, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought about giving their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, to know her unclear past.
The "Journal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i", which witnessed the efforts to search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
Reporting of reporters, emotions of the moments, statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the outer town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home, there began to be misunderstandings between parents, and my mother was forced to leave the home.
He decided to keep the girl, and me to send me home.
He stopped the girl, and since then I didn't know anything.
“When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late,” Alina, the girl’s biological mother, recalls.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and even then the girl’s father, Costica Balkan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman county.
Their lives would be definitively separated.
They didn't find Lina at the hospital.
After internment, Crina’s father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, and her father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
“She thought she was abandoned,” says a family niece.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one has been interested in the fate of the child in all this time, it was taken over by the Directorate General of Social Assistance and Child Protection of Iasi, which then gave it to the Bucium Placement Center.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after a while she was going to move with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"It's as if my wife gave him life," he tells us smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while grasping the girl's fistful hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina’s parents, Alina and Costica, continued their searches separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then told them that she may have died, but in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I searched for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she's gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for it I had no more.
We prayed to God that he would be well.
I've been thinking about her all these years that have passed, but there's been no way we could walk, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in her eyes, Crin's biological mother.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was a kid when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," says Crina delighted.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling Antidrug Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore’s desire to find Crina’s biological family.
And the search started only with a name.
After a request from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I only got one name, the Coastal Balkans, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I was able to ask if there is through the locality the name received.
Then they gave me some indications, only that the person found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took us about a month to find the girl's biological father," Romica Ichim, the commissioner-in-chief, said in a statement.
In total, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costica and Alina, especially since each of them had their home in another locality.
We started the steps somewhere in March, and in the months of June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we arranged for a first meeting to take place in September," Ichim added.
Last weekend, Alina and Costica first saw their missing daughter in the halls of the hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, 20 years ago.
The father, thrilled, could barely handle his tears, and his hands trembled unceasingly.
He barely exchanges a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't sleep much.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," says a granddaughter, who also comes with Costica from Ruginoasa.
Lina's meeting with her biological mother and brother
In conversations with his daughter, who is about to study at a well-run university in Italy, Costa Balkan told him, among other things, that if she wants to return to him, in the village, come quietly: she can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and house her.
My mother is also excited, she cries, and she hardly believes that something like this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think anything like this could happen.
I’ve seen cases like this on TV, I’ve been thinking all these years, I’ve been hoping, but I didn’t think I could be that way.
They are very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit you in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," she tells us with tears on her cheeks Alina, Crina's mother, while holding a napkin tightly in her hand.
In it she hides her tears, fortunately, because soon she will see her face after so much bitter weather.
On the other hand, Crina, who will turn 20 in just a few days, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she has a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
After all, my parents were the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina tells us.
First family reunion in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i
In Unirii Square, under the skies of early autumn, the family of Ruginoasa reunites their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
I no longer separate borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, they passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind made, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It’s the first event of its kind organized by such an emotional load, and I’m glad it’s a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most often we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who consume, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we are trying to bring something good back to the companies.
“If I’m asked for such an event, I’ll do it with great pleasure,” says Romic<0xC4><0x83> Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling on Drugs in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walks away telling stories.
They have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns on the leg, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everyone is pulling their soul.
The camps in the outgoing branch of the PSD have concluded an armistice with a gun to the leg.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party’s executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for the party’s positions.
Far from being over, the party’s internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow the fighters to draw their souls.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
It has launched a very simple and very current message in the conditions of now: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of talks over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain has been established.
In the October elections, fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the county branch of the PSD.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main position in the outgoing branch of the party are the Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazár, county councillor Vasile Catea and interim president of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
To these could be added the mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the PSD county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer register in the race, sources within the party claiming that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on the day of the election, nominations can be submitted, and no one would be surprised if it happened.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain united after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all new leadership structures," Catea said.
Until the internal elections are organized, the leadership of the county branch of the PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29, with the preparation of the elections being virtually ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last few days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached to support a united team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions related to the candidacy for the presidency of the PSD Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, the list remains open," commented Stanciu.
An outgoing judge refused the file of violators in Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young people from Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
Vaslui prisoners sentenced to sentences between five and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments for their release today, after the Court of Appeals, the Vaslui Judiciary, has determined their imprisonment immediately after the sentence has been pronounced.
The file was filed with the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with Judge Dan Anton making an application for abstinence, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked that one of the defendants’ lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest penalty in this case.
How the judges motivated the sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate of the Vaslui Judiciary who convicted the seven young men motivated the sentence.
In motivation, the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public opinion.
"The court finds that after the time of placement under the preventive measure of judicial control, restrictive measure of liberty but not deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the accused, their families and their local supporters, it was felt at the level of the local and national community a strong feeling of indignation about the fact would be felt.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be a "church door".
"The court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the accused wanted to highlight in the defences they made, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the Future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades cannot continue the same in the years to come.
Until Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder how much it can affect our choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of the post-war Labour Party.
A Marxist declared, anti-NATO monarchist (at one point asked the EU's Tony Blair, then prime minister, to take the royal family out of Buckingham Palace), a ferocious anti-American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on the political events by the TV channel "Russian and Hambolist" and the terrorists.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is close to being preferred to the United States.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like the ones he said and promised and Tsipras in Greece until the moment he gave way to the real world and economic legitimacy.
The economic program of the new Labour leader includes, among other things, massive renationalisations and printing money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the solution with printing money is not unanimously adopted globally, we would then have global general prosperity!, but who can stop such details?
Of course, we can tax bankers to blood, become a kind of enemy of the left, but as many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Hollande.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by the generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher famously said, “The problem with socialism is that at some point the money of others ends.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance of ever becoming prime minister.
In the early 1980s, another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in belief as the party’s fresh leader, lamentably failed in the election.
And then there was still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant in the workforce as a whole, and extensive automations have led to a massive need for highly skilled workforce in the industry, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn’s election increases the chances of Brexit, i.e. the UK’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country’s membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that shakes the EU’s foundations, you come to an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which was to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and the deep bankruptcies created within it by the Euro crisis and now that of refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so as for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which anyway Berlin becomes more and more the dominant actor).
True, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of the country’s stay in the EU.
Today’s Europe is no longer the Europe of the past.
There are many resentments, which increase in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we had a sample even recently in Jean Clude Juncker's speech, increasingly tends to take major decisions over the head of the vast majority of Member States consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this is happening in a situation where electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time Eurosceptic is growing dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher rates than ever before.
Hence the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing the odds of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If the voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we see a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region to the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric from the accumulated frustrations in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both caused by pressing decisions that took into account only the integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the major tensions in the EU will affect the intensity and the internal tensions in the EU.
And it’s hard to exclude anything from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
He said, “Take the workshop and sweep it.”
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about him in the whole world.
But behind its fame lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That thing also has a name.
It's called "truth."
What to write about Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in an advertising video.
Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i produces and delivers money almost 60 years since it is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes out with the dobruja, he hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to Brâncu<0xC5><0x9F>i."
The country is adorned with its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s infiltration capacity is huge.
Even the Communists failed to eradicate it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes today thrive on the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And, then, again, what else would be said, to write about this man?
Viewed from the pile of books and articles trying to reconstitute his destiny, Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you weren’t lucky enough to be born in a big city and into a wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancusi’s life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe there's a key here.
Maybe this is where the following text should start.
With a sentence, no matter how detestable they are.
Look at the silly success stories that are delivered to you daily in the newspapers and on TV.
Look closely at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, he heard a whole mapworld?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobi<0xC8><0x9B>a, a small village in the municipality of Pe<0xC8><0x99>ti<0xC8><0x99>ani, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
She is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i led a modest life, but one of which was to reap the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist was to confess, in a meeting with Petre <0xC8><0x9A>u<0xC8><0x9B>ea, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious."
For millennia, people led, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went quietly from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has come to us.
But Brancusi’s childhood was far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in his hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when it was done "in the boiler", watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going well, Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with zucchini and drinks unbreathably.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people only notice after a few minutes.
Mother panics, then hysteria, thinking her son is dead.
Towards the evening, when his father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by the praisers, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with their souls in their mouths.
The party immediately turns into mourning.
The father is already thinking about the funeral.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brându<0xC5><0x9F>a, the scented and maids of Brâncu<0xC5><0x9F>i.
The owl checks the baby's breathing, then puts under his nose a horse's bale, gathered around him.
The strong sneezing baby.
The world applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep on his drunkenness, joyfully, the party with praise continues with even more strength.
The next day, father and son meet through the lawn.
Radu Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i asks Constantine to collect some nuts and bring them to him.
The father puts his child head down and, with the nuellas brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the sting of the blows, little Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i has the revelation that the world can be seen from a different perspective and that things around can appear twisted.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in old age, if not somehow the astral itself participates in his disorder.
Would the sun have been as disturbed as his father by what had happened to him?
At present, the city is not functioning.
A parliamentarian calls on politicians to remember those who voted for him.
Independent MP Viorel B<0xC5><0x82>aju<0xC5><0xA3> called on the PSD and the PNL to stop internal struggles and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political stage is a great division and that is all.
I haven’t seen anything from the 2012 USL projects that will continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you only see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's put politics aside, let's get together and talk.
At the moment, the city is not functioning.
“If you’re busy with internal warfare, you don’t have time for those who chose you,” B<0xC5><0x82>aju<0xC5><0xA3> said.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the outgoing electorate, with the consequence being a very low presence at the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing virtually the loyal electorate of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will continue to orient themselves towards traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break from the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties rely on civicly active people, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is shattered even more, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD," Blájuts said.
He said he was not interested in running for office in the upcoming local elections, denying rumors about his intention to run for mayor.
I said I don't want to run for any local office.
I am still wondering if I will continue to be a member of parliament in the future.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Ia<0xC8><0x99>i and in the discussions in the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make a picture of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
“If people voted for us, it doesn’t mean they’re stupid to vote for us anymore if they don’t see anything,” said Blajut, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A colleague from T<0xC4><0x83>t<0xC4><0x83>ra<0xC8><0x99>i said that his money is not enough and he has to go by bus.
Let us not be hypocrites.
It's not little money.
Sometimes I'm embarrassed to pick up cash from the cashier.
At the end of my term, I will report on everything I have spent, apart from the salaries of the employees of the cabinet and its maintenance.
It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and the rest.
"To say to a parliamentarian that money is not enough is pure hypocrisy," Blájut concluded.
