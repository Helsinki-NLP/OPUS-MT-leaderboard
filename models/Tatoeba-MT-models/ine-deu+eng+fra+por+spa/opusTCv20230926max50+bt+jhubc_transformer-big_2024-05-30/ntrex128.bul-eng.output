Members of the Welsh Assembly worry that they “look like muppets”
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the proposal to change their rank to "WCC" (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the “Parliament of Wales”.
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may be a cause for ridicule.
One of the Labour MPs said his group was concerned that the new name was being "remove with Tup and Vdlub."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party has indicated that his group is "not biased" to the change of name, but notes that the new name MWP has a certain verbal resemblance to "stupid".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the bill to change the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names with which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, establishing broad support for the Assembly to start calling itself the “Parliament of Wales”.
As for the posts of its members, the Commission prefers ‘Mrs. of Parliament of Wales, in short ‘MPP’, but the ‘MPP’ option has received the most support after a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternative options, but reaching a consensus will clearly be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to file the bill for change within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they arrive at a discussion of the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called “Macedonia”.
Athens has long insisted that her northern neighbor’s name is a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to her attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the name of the country, has said he will not hold the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the country’s name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut amid difficulties in Harlem's churches
“If we look from a historical perspective, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally at every corner,” Adams said.
"They're both gone today."
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People today socialize in different ways,” he adds.
“Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms, where everyone gathers regularly.”
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not be enough for as long as the leaders expected, “and sooner or later they will be in the same situation.”
The man adds that the churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments where people live that do not help the survival of the other shrines in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people buying homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is especially unlikely that most of the new settlers will visit them.”
Both churches were built by white shepherds before Harlem became a black neighborhood – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist herd was expelled in the years after 1930.
The building then became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin was taken over by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main market street, as they did not want to hire black workers.
In 1939, the building suffered severe damage in a fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners drafted a plan for its restoration, in which they ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them the “poor bells.”
The expert who used the bells in July has a different description: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Nguyen, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell system in the world to be used by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether mentions that St. Martin has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin’s in the last few weeks has been a complex tale woven by architects and performers, some brought by secular church leaders and others by the diocese.
From the vestibule - which is the governing body of the parish, consisting of secular leaders - they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concern that the diocese "would be willing to transfer the expenses of the vestibule", although the parish did not have a role in the hiring.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old child injured by shark while hunting lobster in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the first day of the hunting season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had snorkeled with friends around half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and joined a group to pull him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, then realized how he was yelling, “Bit me!
He bit me!"
Hamel says that when he got to the boy, he found out that the entire area of his jaw had been torn.
“I’ve called everyone out of the water because there’s a shark!” adds Hamel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was received in critical condition.
It is not yet known what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescue captain Larry Jills told a news briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but it has been judged not to be of a dangerous species.
Jils adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of her body.
Authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Suomi in Ensittinas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Jils notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them do not pose a threat to humans.
Sainsbury's planning an offensive on the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening beauty product stands at their facilities, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the beauty products market in the UK, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while at the same time sales of fashion and household products are declining, the largest so far open beauty products stands in the country will be located in 11 stores.
The investment turn in the beauty industry is taking place at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the shelves, previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury has said it will double the number of beauty products offered to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space, similar to offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also releasing its boutique range of makeups, so most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will try discount programs at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will be found in Cely Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shifting focus on buying smaller amounts of food daily at convenient times means that supermarkets need to put more effort into attracting buyers.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will look more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discounters by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury’s has run Argos stores in hundreds of stores, as well as opening Habitats stores since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has boosted grocery sales and made the gains even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to reshape its facilities for beauty and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experiment with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 sites to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury, said: “We have transformed the look and character of our beauty stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands we offer aims to cater to every taste and every need in a captivating environment with a convenient location, making us an attractive destination for beauty products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' over Holly Willoughby's rejection of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons star Den Peter Jones is "infuriated" after TV host Holly Willoughby dropped a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the Truly brand of home appliances and accessories.
The couple's business was compared to the Goop brand of Guinett Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of This Morning has announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones to “boil” after pulling out of their profitable lifestyle products business at the last minute – while focusing on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "infuriated" when the TV's "golden girl" admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant there would be no more time for his brand.
The business resembled Guinnett Poltrow's Goop brand, with rumors that it doubled Willoughby's fortune, which is projected to be <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willaby announced on Instagram her departure from Truly, Jones left the UK by plane to head to one of her vacation homes.
One of the sources said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave boiled absolutely all unprepared.
No one thought this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There’s a warehouse in Marlowe that’s full of products waiting to be sold.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leader of This Morning, which is one of the UK's most successful stars, could cost the company millions because of the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a slump in the market.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is a mother of three, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby herself founded Truly with Cap in 2016, with Jones, 52, joining as the company's chairman in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and will also replace Ann McParlin as the host of I Am a Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We are not going to comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult Negotiations Leading to “Heating Relationships”
He joked about the criticism he would have received from news channels for commenting, which someone would consider “unfit for the president” and too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his joking “journalistic” way.
“I have not given up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump to be a "great step towards the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons."
Negotiations to remove this weapon are stagnating.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yung Ho told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea "does not see reciprocal attitude" on the part of the United States towards its country's first steps on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at sustaining the tension.
In his speech, Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things.
“Our relations with North Korea are wonderful,” he said.
“We were on our way to war with this country.
Millions of people would die.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results: an end to missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the bodies of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to be a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there,” Trump said, pointing the crowd at him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroys Island and Kills Hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was forced to flee their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, there is an unequivocal view that international assistance is not required, which makes things slightly challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is forming a team to head to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country's territory.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not a common sight on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
A recently stationed in Lombok to service the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship has headed for Palu, but it will be at least three days before it can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s lagging infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign, investing large amounts of money in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, while Joko is again going to the ballot box the following year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturge brought a late tie for Liverpool vs Chelsea
Daniel Stirring saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stirring received a pass from Jordan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's gate, while his team lagged behind 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left leg, then made a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty area and pointed towards the upper right corner of the net.
She transferred the plunger Kepa Arisabalaga and weaves irresistibly into the net.
“I’ve tried to take a good position to control the ball because players like Shack are always looking for passes in the front positions, so I just tried to gain as much time as possible for a good shot at the door,” Stirring told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante asking, I pushed my ball and I just shot without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of Belgian star Eden Azar.
The striker of the "blue" passed with a heel to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> exchanged a quick double feed in the center.
Then he fired a quick pass, with which he took Azar to a clean position in the penalty area.
Azar ran over the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 this Wednesday at the Stadium "San Paolo" in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early on Sunday.
Many people have been trapped among the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and led to waves as high as 20 feet, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho spokesman told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is littered with ruins of ruined buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation is underway after this morning in Berkenhead, Merseyside, the body of a woman was discovered.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds to Grayson Meaves on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for assistance from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I beg anyone who has been close to John Street in Burkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something with the cameras on their dashboard, to contact us as it is possible that they have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Burkenhead and was found in a private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends who consider the woman to be their acquaintance arrived and questioned where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Meaves tried to get home to his apartment, but was notified by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man remained silent when he found out about what had happened.
Residents were told that it would take hours for them to be allowed to return home.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A weeping woman appeared on the spot.
She keeps saying, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans crossed the border while another van remained outside.
There are police officers on the border who are watching the apartment block.
All those with information are requested to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue Becomes the Newest Memorial Hit by "Rewriting History"
Her ban will be poetic justice for his almost Taliban destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's to Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent performance by Sir William Hamo Tornickroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of historiography of a figure that many still regard as worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than it is today, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, it is the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate presentation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the division that has occurred.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of commemoration and celebration.”
Pig killer wounds Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his surname as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a stall at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was preparing to inject its pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Sinin of Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also welded the door to the next door open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the lair with a bloody fang.
Forensic expertise has confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and disfigured,” said Cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so it could not attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence from the crime scene.
It was also reported that Yuan's family and market leadership were negotiating death compensation.
Although they are rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man was critically injured after the attack.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig tied a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to drive him out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of the blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not intended to hurt anyone.
But a man must also treat them with respect,” the man concludes.
Weakening Hurricane Rosa Will Lead to Frequent and Heavy Rains in Southwestern U.S.
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane starting at 5 a.m. Sunday morning Eastern time and located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
During this time, over the Pacific Ocean, a synclinal begins to form, moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha Peninsula of California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the tropical US moisture deep northward to the south.
On Monday, Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching synclinal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, debris-bearing streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over most of Arizona.
Lightning flooding may occur in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a handful in the desert when the threat of tropical rains is imminent.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to raised dust and thunderstorms.
The approaching synchlinal will lead to heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach rainfall of more than half an inch, which will lead to tolerated small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rainy season.
Late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain hits a larger area on late Mondays and Tuesdays.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October may bring major temperature fluctuations to the United States as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There is a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to parts of the northeast expected to prevail around 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the fascinating sight of the testimony of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political opposition continued, with the networks interrupting their regular turnaround programs in the last few minutes on Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI must conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotionally deprived testimony, is absolutely categorical that such a thing has not happened.
It’s likely even more than Nielsen’s reported 20.4 million viewers had seen the testimony on Friday.
The company has counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No data were directly available for the other networks which broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen has traditionally struggled to measure the number of people looking from their workplaces.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football match or the Hollywood Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras shot him on Friday as protesters whistled at him as he attempted to grab an elevator for a Judicial Commission meeting.
During all the harassment for a few minutes he never raised his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here, standing in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he is presenting the truth to the state?
“You have power, while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Flake responded that a statement had already been issued from his office and, before the doors of the elevator were closed, said he would make further statements during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks provided close live coverage a few hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh's nomination to the attention of the full Senate for a vote.
Flake said he would only do that if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which opposition Democrats are pushing for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the Democrat senator Chris Cowens.
After a conversation with Queens and several Senators, Fleck made a decision.
His election was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political toys' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political messing” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview previously published with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Lady's Play Plan" for Brexit, proposing that the EU's "recognition of customs duties from Great Britain" was a "recognition of the EU's customs duties".
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Deaton Simpson for LSU Player Death
Police have arrested a suspect for completing the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the LSU.
The 20-year-old has been arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials unveiled a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, with police reporting that Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson’s DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
Following Simpson's interrogation, police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shooting against Wade.
His bail is set at $350,000, Advocate said.
The Forensic Medical Service of East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday, citing a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police, the Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University police and local residents for the assistance provided in the investigation, which contributed to the arrest.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for “temporary justice”.
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6-foot and 6-inch tall player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 Ricochets per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "cracked" and "shocked" after Wade's death.
Wade said, “That’s something that worries a person all the time.”
Volcano scatters ash over Mexico City
The Popocatepetl ash ejected from the volcano reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center has observed a number of tremors and tremors.
Pictures posted on social media show a thin layer of dust that covers the windshields of cars in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Hokimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie as thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote to secede Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to bury peacekeepers with eggs and dust paint, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which are usually crowded by tourists.
Later in the day, other clashes with the police arose, as the police resorted to their sticks to control the situation.
For hours, independence support groups shouted, “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while those who declared themselves to preserve the integrity of the country replied, “Spain forever.”
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical care for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the region even a year after a referendum held on 1 October was deemed illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority voted to vote for independence, although activity was low as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the polling stations in the region with a series of violent clashes.
Independence-seeking groups spent Friday night on the streets to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narciso Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer hides hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
“Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in a state of stagnation.”
Despite the noted important victory, even with a small difference, of the regional elections last December, the independence supporters of Catalonia political parties are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their best-known leaders are either in self-imposed detention or have been arrested in anticipation of a process.
Johann Pyug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was provoked by politicians from both sides.
His comment is that “it’s getting more and more tense.”
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders arrested in anticipation of a preliminary trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of the democratic values and repressions we are witnessing on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Collided Into House
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car slammed into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings has announced that damage has been done to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot with an arbalète.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston's top-league rookie surprised the Rangers and only inflicted a second loss to Steven Gerard in his first 18 games as manager of the Aybrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team tied for second in the Hibernian standings.
Gerard's team went unwinnable in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday faced the Harts driver, who was eight points behind in the standings.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a six-game series without a loss in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a good opportunity against the bad guys.
Holt's team had to lead the score long before scoring a goal, and his direct playing style made Rangers extremely difficult.
Scott Robinson pierced the defense, but his blow went aside, then Alan Litgow shot past the beam after Craig Halkett returned the ball head-to-head to him.
The hosts left the Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously complicate the guests from static positions.
And that’s how we got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining each other and taking out Menga, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
By this point, the Rangers had mastered the ball more, but faced impenetrable defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued through the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a save.
Ranger's goalkeeper saved Scott Pittman's foot shot, and Little's head shot passed through the door after another static position for Livingston.
Livingston’s penalty area was filled with centre-backs, but they were easily cleared, and the referee twice disregarded the claims of the guests for the duel – first after a duel between Halkett and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then in case of doubts about playing by hand.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays just superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style and composition of the game hardly changed after the team returned to the Premier League, but Holt deserved a lot of praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga was constantly keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard’s guidance, they were demonstrating some great things, but in this case they were far below these standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, only once they were able to split the defense of the hosts – this loss must wake up the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship has cooled due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s admission into the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to discover a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but nonetheless many supporters crowded around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s own policy and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the fracture caused by one visitor, who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist rests after a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but nevertheless the cyclist died on the spot.
The crash comes a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by an escaped driver on Childers Street, nearly a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said its employees were working to identify the man and would then notify his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are diverted, and motorists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, the Prison Service reported.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at around 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to control it, special officers from the Tordano squad were summoned, who would have to deal with eight detainees, such as the uprising itself confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards sustained minor injuries on the faces and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prison Service made the following statement: “Specially trained staff will be called to deal with the incident in Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it extremely clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended.”
The Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack by a prisoner, the director of the prison had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the riot control units were summoned to the prison to seize a severe riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (although drought areas may benefit)
Arizona is rarely hit by a tropical storm, but there is a high probability that this will happen early next week, as weakening hurricane Rosa carries it through the southwestern desert, leading to the risk of flash flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already set up flash flooding posts on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, with the possibility of rain on late Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service tweeted: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!”
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of precipitation being possible in individual locations.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rose can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain is likely to be useful as the southwestern part is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Commission, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second heaviest category.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to land on the Baha Peninsula of California in Mexico.
The rose, which on Sunday morning still boasts a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach land near Mexico by the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall over part of Mexico can be severe and lead to a significant risk of overcrowding.
“Total rainfall is expected to be up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora, with possible up to 10 inches,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by Tuesday late in the evening.
"The main risk of Rose or its consequences is extremely heavy rainfall in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and carrying various waste streams in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrains.
Midsomer Northon Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Summerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Northon around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
He is admitted to a hospital where his condition remains “stable”.
During the night, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are asking anyone who may have taken a picture of what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh was "suffered by the vileness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“Any vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the insidious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffered by the vileness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically dismissing Christine Blaise Ford's allegation of sexual assault decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “today the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence, courage and qualities.”
“Any vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a great reputation in public service,” the president told a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections in our time.
“Although I’m not a candidate, I’m actually involved too,” Trump said.
“That’s why I’m running and fighting in support of good candidates.”
Trump said Democrats have set themselves a mission to “hinder and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican party aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis, death toll rises
At least 384 people have lost their lives after many were swept off the coast by giant waves when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at night the coast was swept by waves of up to six meters in height (18 feet), took many to their deaths and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami hit after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t flee immediately, which is why many became victims of the disaster,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BP’s disaster management agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The water had brought with it cars, trees, whole houses, struck everything in its path," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the shore.
“Some people climbed the trees and managed to escape the water,” he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Images from the air showed multiple buildings and shops destroyed, bridges demolished and twisted, as well as a water-enclosed mosque.
Secondary quakes continued to swing the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Appraisal and Implementation Agency (BPPT) issued a statement saying that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found beneath the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher on the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the coward's epicenter.
He also added that “communications are completely interrupted and there is no information from Donggala.”
The Red Cross said there were more than 300,000 people living there, adding that its teams and volunteers had already headed to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticized for failing to inform the affected Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived at the time of the announcement.
Shared on social media, amateur videos show a man on the top floor of a building shouting panic warnings to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall hits the shore and carries both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video in a timely manner.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage, which halted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated still desperately needed food and other essentials.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala managed to get safely to Palu, where they found shelter in tarpaulin shelters stretched out in the yard of their office, they passed through a series of scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba says.
“They told me they had seen countless houses destroyed.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the work started on rescue and recovery operations emergency groups, some complain that those with extensive experience in such situations foreign rescuers are prevented from reaching Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, dispatch of personnel and supplies from abroad can only begin if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“The crisis is still regional,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there they have not yet declared such a status.”
As Palu falls on the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days with her mother's body.
Gendondo Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendondo recalled how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa Hotel reached the community by paragliding, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue ticks, however, the only response to his messages was a single grey one.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he added.
Thieves raise $26,750 while charging an ATM in Newport on Levi
On Friday morning thieves picked up $26,750 from a Brink employee who loaded an ATM in Levi's Newport, a news release from the Newport police station said.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to charge it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “came running behind the back of Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses have noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the report continues, but police have not indicated the number of people involved in the theft.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the suspects should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has been using it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande in the show, who gave up "for emotional reasons", the creator of the show tells us.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously argued that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'he' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you'," West shared earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It passed from Kanye, which means only one person, just to Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence.”
The rapper is one of many known in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preferences for the pseudonyms Leo and Brother Leo.
One of West's former collaborators, Jay-Z, also presented himself in a variant with or without a hyphen and/or capital letters in his nickname.
Mexico's president vows not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised “never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with leftist political views gradually spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador swore an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI development
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the development front of artificial intelligence, the US needs to double its research budget in this area, said AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various departments of the U.S. government made statements on the topic of AI, although the U.S. as a whole does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: the country aims to become the number one for innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the AI development budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make further breakthroughs in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could also double the chances of the next big AI achievement coming from the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies – Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon Lee University, he worked on an AI system that defeated America’s most successful othello player, after which he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee paid tribute to the federal government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Agency’s Advanced Defense Research Projects Robotics Competition, and asked when the next one would be, which would help identify the new visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government funding,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university lights to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its AI program.
“I think that AI doctors should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI development from there.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonia’s citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia’s membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents claims against its territorial integrity, which is why it vetoes its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Georgi Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum himself, while a campaign to boycott him casts doubt on whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognize its validity.
The question in the bulletins is: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have said they will comply with the result to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the state, two-thirds of the parliamentary representatives must vote for it.
The State Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the polls.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gyose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will pave the way for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of the tents, stretched by the boycotting referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the gate for servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as the unemployment rate in the country is over 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his own vote.
The state also said that the positive result will lead to the “confirmation of the future of our people.”
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published the results of a survey, according to which between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian television Thelma, revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes through all of Brighton's defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's victory 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He raced three defenders from Brighton before sprinting with the ball into the empty space ahead.
Aguero was then surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped past one of the defenders, then left the others behind on the border of Brighton's penalty field.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguarero, who with a right leg punch overwhelmed Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
“Aguero is fighting some injuries in his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We planned for him to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal right now.”
But Sterling was the one who secured the initial lead of the "blinds" in this match of the High League of England.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In the naked situation, Aguero got a pass deep in Brighton's half.
He immediately dropped a leading pass on the left flank towards Leroy Sane.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the distant beam.
The striker of the "heavenly blues" managed to catch up close, shortly before the ball came out.
City will face Hofenheim in a group stage match of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhine Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Chercer wants to play to determine the fate of the Rockies
Since the Nationals didn’t qualify for the playoffs, it doesn’t make much sense for another match on a titular starting pitcher.
Still, the ever-ambitious Shercere hopes to be the headliner on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, if the match is relevant for the Rockies, who lead with one match against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies have secured at least a wild card after a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but it's not yet certain they'll win their first division title.
“While we are not fighting for anything ourselves, we want to finish the season with a great game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game for them this year.
“Why would I want to miss a game like that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are expected to allow Scherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Scherzer, this would be his 34th start-up game this year, with a practice on Thursday and a normal rest period until Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Recruits Supporters in West Virginia
President Kosso hinted at the situation with his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices in our lives.
“This is one of the greatest moments in current history – I also say that although I’m not a candidate, I’m actually involved, that’s why I’m fighting hard for the right candidates,” Trump said.
“You all see this terrible, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain their power in any way, you yourself are witnessing their relentlessness, their evil.
They don’t care when they can hurt, who they have to run over in order to hold on to power and governance, because they only care about power and governance, but we will not give them to them.”
The Democrats, in the words of the president, have set themselves the goal of “obstacle and hinder”.
"What we have all seen in the last four days," he continued, calling Democrats "angry, nasty, vicious and unfaithful."
The president recalled the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein in her name, which sparked loud mobs.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I waited — it was a really nasty gesture — maybe the worst I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer in full swing.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last Labour MP so far to be told he’s not welcome – just because I’m speaking frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar attitude because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed during the time of previous leaders.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings to include everyone and to be fruitful.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of a “lighter and more moderate” policy have long been forgotten, if ever they were on the agenda at all.
It became increasingly obvious that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion was judged on the basis of how much the leadership of the party liked it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues I previously worked for who I thought shared similar political views began to expect me to take a turn and take positions that I would never agree with – either on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I actually say – there follows a whole offensive tyranny on social media, where it calls for revocation, rejection of moderate politics, statements that I do not belong to the Labour Party.
That doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I have even had more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments for me are, at least, mostly political in nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist bribes every day without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults became the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is far from widespread, with any sign of distrust or change in the rules of choice becoming increasingly tightened.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice to tame myself, not to talk so much and then “everything will be okay”.
But that’s not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Thatcher government, which by its neglect led to the literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local counselor or as a miner.
I have never hid my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political stance and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the country rushes to Brexit, it will hurt households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of withdrawal or political exclusion will refuse me to act in the way that I consider your best interests to be in your defense.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air led the rankings
The two late rehearsals may have slightly changed the final result, but there’s no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent’s Premier League match.
The team already leads the rankings and the only one of the ten teams is without a loss to date.
Better defense and better use of opportunities proved crucial in the match, from which coach Peter Murci and his team can be very pleased.
"I'm happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the past games and we're still without a loss," Mercy said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their positions better than us.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional blow from Frasier Climax, led Air forward in the result, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to draw in the result, followed by a rematch.
Climate increased the lead for Air from a penalty kick just before halftime, marking an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the additional kick, making the score 17-5 for Air on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful extra shot at Bagot, reduced the lead to only five points.
There was a prolonged suspension of the game due to a severe injury to Ruarid Nott, who was carried on a stretcher, and after the resumption of the match Air increased their advance after an essay by Stafford McDowell and a successful additional blow to Clima.
Afterwards, Air Captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage, exerting strong pressure and performing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts regained their presence of spirit and when Stryan Hutchinson received a yellow card after defeating Climax without a ball, McPherson realized an essay from the ensuing penalty play with the help of the forward offensive line of Air.
Clima realized the extra blow, and not long after did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught the kicked-out ball from David Armstrong and pulled the wing Gregor Henry on the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to have headed for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems to have turned to a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, on which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedic partner Greg Hemfield.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last for the show, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning his life after Craigling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor abstained from commenting, although a source from Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan intended to join Glasgow's "blooming restaurant business."
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia hopes the vessel will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are constantly patrolling the docks with a naval headquarters in La Paz.
There is an ocean blue flag flying over public buildings.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right.
It is our duty to bring it back.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – and the call to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict by the international court on October 1, after five years in consideration.
"The strength is in Bolivia, there is a sense of serenity and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians will watch the big-screen international court judgement across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia’s demand and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to head for a contested re-election battle next year, has also staked much and much on the court’s verdict on Monday.
“We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean,” Morales said last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of a court ruling in favor of Bolivia is quite small. Even if it judges in her favor, it would not change things into reality.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to seize Chile and has decided it will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the last arguments indicates that the case is “not complicated,” replies Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have actually hurt her.
“The problem of access to the ocean has been inflated by the current government of Bolivia,” Zarate said.
He then suggested that Morales's warlike rhetoric had extinguished Chile's few remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct a normal dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
Bolivia will have the “incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile,” as well as the chance to “stop 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides.”
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – had used the problem of access to the ocean as a “political sledgehammer.”
“Bolivia will never give up its right to leave the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if it is not able to trust Washington.
Ree made his speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises it made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming a deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri called the idea of continuing with U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War “empty hope” that would cause the North to fall on its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture on the road to disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about refusing an arsenal that it sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest scream of massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun rays, there is no need to look for more.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that stunned the fashion stage during the Paris Fashion Week.
Pretty impractical hats sparked a wave on Instagram in the summer, with designers sending their eye-catching creations to stun the fashion community.
Valentino’s highlight was an extravagant beige hat with feathers resembling a wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-decorated melons, a wizard’s hat and even pineapple – but they aren’t meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and were not as much reminiscent of high fashion as they were of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a scuba gear in a full kit with a snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a molten funnel of ice cream.
If you fall for similar fashion trends, then you are in luck.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
Huge hats come quite soon after “La Bomba” – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on everyone’s heads – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat, which took over social networks, led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as the wearer wearing it in a bathing suit.
The raffia bag with a burnt orange color, with raffia lashes and a white leather handle, was the eye-catching item in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitide told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – once the designer has made such a big impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language Skills are Essential to Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, with this continuing in 2018 with another excellent presentation of exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, arts, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen careers and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can compose and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language you understand about him, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
The results of this year’s exams show that languages are among the most successful for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved the high grade A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72% of students achieved grade A in Chinese, with the same grade having 72% of German students, 69% of French schools and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for the future.
Languages as a subject of free choice by students are currently receiving the same treatment as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) in both independent school programs and beyond.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Labour Skills found that 17% indicated insufficient language skills due to employers having difficulty finding employees.
Therefore, it is becoming increasingly compulsory to speak foreign languages in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the proficiency of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill, which remains for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multilingual person one breast in front of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adult citizens in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, with French being the only language whose proficiency reaches a two-digit percentage with a rate of 15%.
That’s why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Mastering several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different from the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK in a future plan by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers being specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, there is no denying that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages should really be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are excited to see LeBron James’ first match with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in the team's first match of the pre-season preparation against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet clear how many minutes he will play in the match.
“He’ll be on the pitch in between one and 48 minutes,” Walton said via the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election rallyes tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies, which include stops at well-known locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the affirmative vote on his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when casting votes in November.
What time will Trump’s rally in West Virginia take place tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s visit to Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wilking, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in which tensions have surfaced over allegations of immoral sexual acts, which holds the Senate’s affirmative vote up to a week while an FBI investigation is underway.
The main goal of this series of rallies, however, is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
That’s why President Donald Trump’s campaign announced that these five rallies next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so essential to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season full of commitments,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally tonight, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will make his second visit this month to West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in sociological research.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before Sunday’s singles
After three consecutive sessions without the intrigue of a foursome, Sunday afternoon matches may have brought what the Rider Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sport is a rather subjective concept, however, in which players believe unreservedly, even more in competitions like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They led by six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we've gained some momentum," Jordan Speight said at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points, with only twelve remaining to be allocated.
However, as Speight says, the Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we are to judge by the sporting form of Speight and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them took three of four possible points.
Speed shows excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
Fans' encouraging cries grew louder as he progressed into the round, in which with a sharp punch he leveled the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas were behind by two punches after the first two holes.
His blow, which won the match in the 15th hole, was met with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that really not everything is lost for the American team.
“The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own game,” says Spit.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Speed and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Rider Cup so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe has won four out of four and they seem to be getting everything.
Mollywood were the only couple who didn’t make “gods” on Sunday afternoons, but they also didn’t have “gods” either on Saturday mornings or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These successive successes, as well as the way energy seemed to pass between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the opinion that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari who will bring the potential victory to Europe.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the tales of European fame turned out to be a little premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's "football" matches, while he partnered with Alex Norren.
"Bogi" and two "doubles" of the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in trouble they were unable to cope with.
On Sundays, however, no one else can solve your problems.
"Football" and "foursome" matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any time.
The Europeans played better as a team and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of “fours” matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight to the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe lead 10-6 in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup after leading the United States 10-6 after playing the four-match formats on Saturday.
Inspiring duo Tommy Flittlewood and Francesco Molinari started with two wins against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, raising their asset at Le Golf National by four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Björn dominated the morning football matches over the Americans who made mistake after mistake, and eventually Europe won the series with 3–1 wins.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the four-match games, where they won two wins, but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points out of 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first newcomer from Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as "Mollywood", after this sensational weekend became just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After relentlessly defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they were extremely motivated to defeat broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambo with an even more categorical 5&4 score.
Woods, who barely made it through both of his games on Saturday, has only occasionally shown off his genius, but so far there have been 19 losses out of 29 games in the four-match and four-match matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who was given a break for the morning "fourball" matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the "foursome" clashes in the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coppa - number one and number three respectively in the world.
However, the European team failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They scored a difficult 2<0xC2><0xA7>1 win against the Spaniards John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" matches, and later returned to defeat Paulter and Rory McKilroy by 4&3 in the "foursome" matches, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team hit a four-point deficit ahead of the singles, and according to the rules, Furick's team will retain the trophy even if they are on an equal footing.
However, after being beaten in two consecutive days, their chances of turning on Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says there is "no way" to disarm unilaterally, without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the U.N. on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepened mistrust of the United States and there is no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organization, Ri Yong-hoo said that "significant measures of goodwill have been taken in the last year", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances will we be able to disarm unilaterally first."
While Ri expressed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stage-by-step" approach to nuclear weapons elimination, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking step-by-step measures, his statement appeared significant because it did not reject the unilateral nuclear deal.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump gave assurances of security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for easing tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States is insisting on ‘removing nuclear weapons first’ and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposing the ‘end-of-war declaration,’” Ri said.
“The realization that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream for those who don’t know us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the U.S. leader underlined at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the country on the nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea, not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have been possible.
However, Ri’s tone of speech was significantly different from last year’s when he told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korean missiles targeting the U.S. mainland were unavoidable after “evil president” Trump called Kim a “suicide man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with “complete destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no deadline for this and said, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "implementation of the Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to halt funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to destroy a missile facility and nuclear complex if the U.S. takes “appropriate action.”
According to him, Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he is pursuing are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning “all night” using caffeine.
A professor found that students at the number one university in the world often don’t even think about the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, designed the course, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“Finally, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me this only now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the most essential about how good sleep habits help academic and sporting achievements, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Bareira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of a room in a dorm where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleep routine.
Another part of the participants was told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” added Prof. Kiesler.
The culture of the pride of “learning all night long” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Providing enough and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even to avoid filling up, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a mode of hunger that keeps them hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Keysler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says his course “opened his eyes” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Keysler recommends that students consider whether to set a sleep and wake alarm and know the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga goal crushes Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Steven Gerard's hopeless squad and brought a 1–0 win for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as a guest of the triumph in February with 4–1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only inflicted Gerard's second defeat in his 18th game as manager, which left his team in the squad with eight points less than the scoring.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the constructively deprived Rangers team at no point seemed close to a tie-up.
After the game, the Rangers slipped into sixth place, and Livingston is now third, lagging behind the second Hibernian only by a goal difference.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems, as side judge Callum Spence was wounded in the head after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, which defeated Air in the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livingston 11 that scored against Harts last week, and he should have been pleased with the way his aggressive team pared all the opponent's actions.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarer cases when they owned it.
They should have scored in the second minute, when Menga pulled out with one touch Scott Pitman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed the good opportunity.
Later centering Keegan Jacobs by foul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Litgow diverted the ball away from the rear beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything substantive in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought he should have a duo in the 15th minute when he clashed with Stephen Lawles, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers scored only two precise shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly handled the headshot easily with Lasana Kulibali's head and Oviedo's weak shot.
Although Livy's 34-minute hit was surprising given the possession of the ball, it was completely deserved.
The Rangers were once again unable to cope with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed it to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by replacing Culibali with Ryan Kent and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the strike.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a host-friendly style of play, with Litgow and Halket constantly repulsing forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to cope with Jacobs's blow, and at the subsequent corner Litgow shot his head across the beam.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton asked for a duel at the end of the match after a duel with Jacobs, but Thompson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and NUMBER... the day on which the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science since then, the Geiger counter also became a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, which apparently featured the amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What, for God’s sake, is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “It certainly matters right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery, which bears his name, continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Train Immune System to ‘See’ Foreign Cells
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and are re-injected into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then injecting them again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofski explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West delivered a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription “Let’s Make America Great Again” during his participation in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was cast in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a pointless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let's make America great again," he declared himself against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual abuse complaints made by Christine Blazey Ford.
Although not aired, the recording of West's performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear why Rock tried to make fun of West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“I was caught behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go out with that hat."
They harassed me!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that he will wear the Superman suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
The comments caused at least two whistles from the audience and the SNL team members looked embarrassed, Variety reported, one of whom said: "The whole studio shut down."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of "Perie".
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR DOING WITH THE PRESIDENT."
The show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was "just himself and that's wonderful."
“But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I think he welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "officially known as Kenny West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy, and Puff Daddy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Accused of attempted murder after being stabbed in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor.
"Game of Thrones" star Keith Harrington opposes toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for the role of the swinging sword John Snow in the violently medieval fantasy series of the NGO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the macho character’s stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think they have to be “crude” to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his partner from Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admits he feels "strongly convinced" that this problem needs to be solved.
“At the moment, I’m personally firmly convinced – what have we gotten wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach teenage men about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the many masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that makes boys feel like they need to become this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how to change it?
Because obviously something is wrong with the young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be in the prehistoric or sequel to "Game of Thrones" after the series ended next summer, claiming he had "finished the battlefields and the horses."
From November, Keith will play a role in Sam Shepherd’s True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that acquaintance with his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this show, so that’s how he gave me my future family and set my life forward,” he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl in whom Keith Snow's character falls in love, in the fantasy series, winner of the Emmy Award.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a jump of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and spine.
According to the health services in the country, more than 820,000 people were affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of an infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China’s health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and spine in China increases by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in KGBT communities is widespread.
According to studies, because of conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies there was a leak of data from Republican senators, denouncing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, U.S. House Speaker Maxine Waters condemned allegations that a member of her team had published personal information of three U.S. senators by Republicans on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and sites on the “ultra-right wing.”
“Lies, lies and more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of state senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on allegations of immoral sexual behavior against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was carried out after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts is linked to Waters' office, and released information about a member of her team, Hill said.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Flaisher.
“There is anger in this denial,” Flüscher wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to fit a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He shouldn't behave like a challenger.
I don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced.”
Flysher compared Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of also appearing angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“Essentially, if that’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had sued the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies for these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be held legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team.”
Johnny English Explodes Again – A Weak Spying Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in any new British feature film, and it seems to be the case for the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with a comedy-drama.
Will self-absurdity and the mimicry that speak of how obvious we are become become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with round eyes and a “rubber” face, is allowed to repeat things a second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a great comic creation intended for film fans who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a silly secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering brilliance, owns a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr. Bean, and a lot of the man who contributed a note on the musical theme of Chariots of Fire to the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
In addition, it was originally based on the chaos left behind by a traveler and international man played by Atkinson in the already forgotten TV commercials on Barclaycard.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and for a short time the wings crawled into his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but humor is rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" movie brands like "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and Johnny English’s crazy accidents are, in my opinion, not innovative and focused, as Actinson’s lack of play is reminiscent of Mr. Bean.
It is always a prerequisite that the UK is facing serious problems.
The cyber-hacker has hacked the British super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operational agents to the duty agent’s horror – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is inflated and aware of the figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Theresa May role, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she should call a retired agent, as all acting agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher in a chic center, but who illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good hits when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English is summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to the commander of a submarine, a cheerful role in which the talent of Vicky Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beautiful Ophelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farces: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of the Walt; and English creates real anarchy when he tries to use a helmet for virtual reality to discover the inside.
All the laughs are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so cute and lush, here is a lot more content intended for children.
Pretty average production.
As with all the other Johnny English films, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work four weeks, but get paid five.
The party says it wants the company’s bosses to provide the savings made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would “pass” the party’s economic agenda and plans to shake the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen right away, but the four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as into the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not in the party’s politics, it is not considered by it.”
The shadow chancellor, John MacDonald, used last week’s Labour conference to unveil his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from “personally impersonal directors” and “speculators” in utility companies.
The Chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not receive their full share, as the Labour government could impose “retentions” on the basis of the breaches identified.
In addition, he confirmed plans to bring workers to the company’s boards and to create privatization funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private companies to employees who can accumulate annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy Speak to ‘60 Minutes’ on whether the FBI’s investigation of Cavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could cause some of the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Peley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after this statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, definite and unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
“I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and to change that, we need a shaking charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has categorically denied it,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive cast of performers and performs an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the large lawn in Central Park who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also get acquainted with the real purpose of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending no email to a world leader, making a phone call or otherwise connecting to help raise awareness.
But how successful is a “Global Citizen” 12 years before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” – people think they’re doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, “Global Citizen” has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who insist on many different purposes.
It says these actions have helped global leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, from which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group believes that the funds insured have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include Twitter's "Food Force", a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors, committing to "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition simply into a historical note,” Food Power Ambassador Tracy Ulman told audiences at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken that call on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, “The Power of Nutrition”, that will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Global Citizen” replied: “It will be a long and difficult journey – sometimes we will fail and again we will fail.
But just as with the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers at this year’s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Fernandes and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use naval forces to “block” and hinder energy exports, Interior Minister
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zink said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinc argues that Russia’s involvement in Syria – in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market,” he said.
Zink addressed attendees at the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace fuels," he said, while describing Russia as a "one-number pony," with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes at a time when the Trump administration has the task of boosting liquefied gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turns Berlin into a “hostage”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion pipeline on Nord Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Elizabeth Warren will look seriously" at the 2020 presidential nomination, the Massachusetts senator says.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "look seriously" at the presidential nomination after the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office.
“It’s time for women to come into Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will look seriously at the presidential nomination.”
Warren expressed his judgment regarding President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he is “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said “of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a sociological survey conducted on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters do not think she should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a study by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this proposal.
The sociological survey showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other top Democratic Party representatives discussed in regards to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed out PTSD to Trak Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through after he returns is known to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with,” she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other veterans of the war that "they come back a little changed, stiffened, come back and wonder if they will receive the respect that they and their brothers in arms have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a sober state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasila's police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the county filed a goodwill petition in Washington in support of asylum seekers and challenging policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claims that her partner “and the sons of his brutal gang members” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected the asylum application on July 20.
She's been detained in Texas.
U.S. attorneys who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy brought back the 2014 Immigrant Appeals Board decision, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney for the District of Columbia Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered according to the specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates this principle,” the report said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that policies that deny immigration harm the U.S. economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political beliefs," Sessions said in his July 11 statement on policy.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double during search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting more and more difficult.
“I feel very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, reassuring her sick boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents are spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwayne Harris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, was lodged outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated outdoors due to ongoing secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears as he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed into the broken wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official newspaper in China posted a four-page ad in a U.S. daily on the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump cited a paid China Daily publication in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa — after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections noted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to run ads to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they equate tariffs on imports between countries.
According to experts from the US and China, at the beginning of the trade war, tariffs in China were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstead in a comment in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “is doubling this harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, China’s government is taking advantage of America’s respected tradition of freedom of speech and press by publishing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited speeches and you will not see a real reflection of the misdirected opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubling economic trajectory," he said.
He added that "one of China's best-known newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although he did not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh's pogrom, Republicans are pushing women voters away from midterm elections, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the pan are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be reversed,” Grant Raher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Racher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s insistence at the last minute on an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is Coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor as the Republicans who control the judiciary committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasius Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded,” Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst, told the news.
“People say the problem is already serious; it’s true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested there might be a backlash if Republicans insisted on confirming the candidacy.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican Party’s National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was put on the bench, it’s about how Republicans deal with it and how they treat it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on who to trust as a result of Ford and Cavanaugh’s testimony, a little more leaning towards the latter.
A new sociological survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say they believe Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh attacked her in a sober state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals while they were at a party following her in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Burners-Lee, is starting a venture that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Burners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said regarding the initiative.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “online storage of personal data” or POD.
It contains lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It resembles Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through any browser, and at the same time is all of them at the same time.
The unique thing about the online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “entitlement to personal data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is the company to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who signed a contract to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change when all their business models were completely renewed overnight.
“We don’t want permission from them.”
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy for trading and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has had a strong influence in the debate over net neutrality.
Despite launching Inrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this new era of the internet," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest, awarded with the Cross of Victoria during the First World War
The 100th anniversary is celebrated in the hometown of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Cross of Victoria for his participation in hostilities during the First World War.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he had been awarded the highest military honors in Britain.
A memorial was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's medal-winning work.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy artillery and machine gun fire."
He later attacked the line of fire and with "incredible courage" led the building forward before attacking an artillery gun with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, placed a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was a “great honor to participate in the parade” and added “the virtue of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be provided to many people.”
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can’t witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 duels, including six from the main map, and was to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Moussasey and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they had stayed up until the early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fan described the switching of the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke."
“The government regulates that at 6 a.m. this content is inappropriate, so the program was replaced with a children’s broadcast,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig," yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Cocker said they would work on planning the meetings to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem,” Cocker said.
“It’s six in the morning on Sunday and we can’t plan things so that the event will take place on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
It was not a government, but a government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We’re going to stick to involving five fights instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to provide more to the fans, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Lower’ Because of His Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality — but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he talked about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long-standing host of the show, Kirsty Young, is in hospital for a few months.
Laverne Daley said he felt “less” than everyone else as he grew up because “it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys.”
He said, “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an active participant in LGBT campaigns and is using his participation in this year’s British Community Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he is doing this because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequences, and wants to inspire “hope” in others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - he was "surprised."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but claims the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young,” he said, attending the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs.”
The two became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley himself says that "his whole worldview" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be with me, Dad, not even on the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand until I stopped breathing and at that moment, when I realized he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that my whole life I had dreamed of it – to jump at the Olympics in front of the audience at home. There was no more awesome feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song, "Proud" by Heather Small, which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still makes him cringe.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
Lost form Michelson remains on the bench for the Rider Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to his old form if he does not want his record to be tied to failure.
Michelson, who took part in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furick for the four-match matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the U.S. squad again, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and training his kicks from a distance in the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the top of his career has never been among the most straightforward players, is not in optimal shape for the tough course of Le Golf National, where long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong shot.
And if the pitch alone is not troubling enough, in Sunday’s ninth match, Michelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is in the team with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood and are aiming to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind before the 12 singles games, make a strong start, it may turn out that Michelson's game is absolutely decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his team-mate, though he could hardly have said anything much different.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and this week.
I don’t think I could have imagined him playing only two games.
“I expected him to play more, but that’s just how it turned out and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else.”
Mikelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most games in the Rider Cup played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in the Rider Cup, which has never approached his impressive individual achievements.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furick said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, smart, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for every team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Thomas Björn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great advance can soon be melted.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Björn, knows from personal experience that the great advantage accumulated before the singles matches since the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be erased.
The Dutchman made his debut in the Valderrama game in 1997, when the team with captain Seve Balisteros led by five points ahead of the Americans, but it was precisely the final right that was almost reached and barely managed to hold the victory with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead on National at Valderrama; we had a big lead on Brookline where we lost, and on Valderrama we won, but very difficult,” said Björn, who won 10–5 in 2018.
So history has to show both me and everyone on the team that it's not all over.
Get ready for the attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing is done until you see the final score on the dashboard.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy and that is exactly what we need to stay focused on.
All the time I’ve been saying that I only think about the 12 players in our team, but we’re also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the players’ performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come out in the foreground, and that is different.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you go out alone, then you put your full capacity as a golfer to the test.
This is the message that should reach the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your partner’s back, as he too has to give up to the end.”
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furick will want his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions being only Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas, who took three of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these great reverses on the last day – he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the Miracle of Medinah.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but it would be good to make the same good start you saw on Brookline and Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under enormous pressure.
That’s why we’ve formed our team and distributed our boys the way we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McKilroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the top half of the arrangement.
"I chose these players in this line-up because I think that gives us the greatest chance of success," Björn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany postpones launch of new warship
The newest frigate of the German fleet was due to be put into operation in 2014 to replace outdated warships from the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and drastically rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand’s flagship of new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer periods of maintenance – the newest frigates should be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the docking ports.
The continued delays mean, however, that the vanguard warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power across the ocean – will be old when they go into service.
The ill-fated frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if it is sent on a combat mission.
Software shortcomings are particularly important, as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was significantly overloaded, reducing its efficiency and limiting the ability of the naval forces to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – also becomes a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), out of the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence commission, admitted that the fleet was “depleted from ships capable of carrying out missions.”
The official said the problem has become bigger over time as the old ships have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the fleet.
The National Trust tracks the secret life of bats
A new study conducted at a mansion in the Scottish Mountains aims to establish how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats, as well as the brown arrowhead water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places in the mansion to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of call sounds of bats, as well as what species they emit.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duarte, NTS’s Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. creating meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Flea populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly over the past century.
They are endangered by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
Populations may be at risk from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, inspections of asylums and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only special bat reserve at the Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Mansion manager David Thompson says it's the perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have great terrain for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of mature trees and a completed suitable habitat.
But there’s a lot more about bats that’s not known, so the work we’re doing here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed that it is important to check for the presence of bats before carrying out property maintenance activities, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a shelter could kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish employee at the Flea Trust, encouraged society to help.
She said, “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s happening to their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and his lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to become famous” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes these allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video on Instagram, addressing his 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the post as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner.
“They want to be famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to build popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they call “an inadmissible publication of privacy suspects,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's room where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the County Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that he was a "good boy" of "99 percent", but in the case he simply yielded to "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims she went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she felt "terrified of revenge" and worried about "not being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal as she continues to live with the trauma from the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'would regret forever' losing car makers
Britain will "regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He said it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the border delay in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The plant in Burnaston – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and about how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says it will close its plant for the Mini model in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in cases of no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the "on-time" principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both from the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border problems, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to complete its inventory at the plant in Darbisher, the company said, and therefore production will stop.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May’s “chess” plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio’s 4’s Today program.
“Following the claims not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to ensure successful supply chains.”
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term, they warn that additional costs will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Zuvalaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly worried: “I judge from experience that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: “We have put out an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s crucial meeting with deputy chief prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred for another week” as the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy chief prosecutor and thus threaten Mueller’s independence has fueled rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was witnessed by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "There is not yet a date set for this, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for the next week.
But we’ll see, and I always try to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters would have disputed this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference from the White House on September 10.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked the reason.
Sanders replied that the rare press conferences were not due to dislike of the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although she said: "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him,” she said, adding, without citing evidence: “We checked these statistics.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but “if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often and you have witnessed it quite often in recent weeks, and this will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and sometimes strange behavior in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Minister Addresses EU Workers at Scotland’s National Health Service on Brexit-Related Fears
The health minister addressed in writing to EU staff working at Scotland’s National Health Service to express the state’s gratitude and desire to remain in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the UK-EU exit negotiations continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to recall how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the meeting on Saturday when his team lost to Vanderbilt Comodoro 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State's senior coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He went to the sideline and somehow just fainted there,” Reid said.
Coaches and medical practitioners supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sidelines before he was placed on a stretcher and taken to the changing rooms for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had exited surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/severity of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student with a college scholarship, is in Tennessee State for the first season since his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK
Under the new plans of the Conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK, with the additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of more than <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year, which will help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today the decision for foreign buyers to pay a higher coat of arms tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and is aimed at high-income people.
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenues to support the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is a supplement to the current coat of arms tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for lending purposes – could amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects revenues to rise by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13 percent of London’s newly built buildings are bought by people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to price hikes and making it harder for first-time buyers to interfere in the property market.
Many of the wealthy areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the coat of arms tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of maintaining high property prices by looting land but not using it, and asked May to abandon affordable housing quotas in order to correct Britain’s “disgrace over housing.”
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive set of proposals for housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to “no blame” evictions.
He also wants to give the councils greater authority to build new homes.
Ms May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be with open doors for those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not fair for non-UK residents, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as the hard-working residents of the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said the "greatest ambition" of his career was to be a senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge to revive the club from north-east England, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, three points from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a game for the B-team and that’s it,” Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportssound.
“But I grew up with the games of Scotland at Hampden, which as a child we watched together with my father, so the national team has always attracted me.
“But this opportunity would only open up if I succeeded at the club level.”
Among Ross's predecessors as Sanderland's managers are names such as Dick Advocaat, David Moses, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paolo DiCanio.
The former coach of Aloa Athletic said he did not feel anxious as the successor of such established names in such a famous club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success right now will be measured by a positive answer to the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Because in terms of structure, base and conditions, he is undoubtedly at the level of the Higher League,” he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I’ll assume that I’ve achieved success here only if I can get the team back there.”
Ross has been a manager for just three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloe not fall out of the Third Division and turned Saint Mirren from a falling team into a winner in the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folklore, St. Myron and Hamilton Academic.
“I was really at the crossroads,” he recalls the time when he took Aloe.
“I really believed that being a manager is the best thing for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making good money, and I had some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I’m still facing the same levels of stress and strain at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m really doing it, I’ve never felt more comfortable in my own skin in my entire conscious life.”

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals research
The summer heat has increased the incomes of British pubs struggling to survive, but it has created more tension for chain restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the prolonged sunny weather and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July followed a similar pattern as in June, when pubs reported a growth of more than 2.8 per cent, but restaurants.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and beverage bars reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Meal bars also suffered from sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped 6.6 percent per month, while in food there was a 3 percent drop.
Paul Newman, RSM Recreation and Entertainment Analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we noticed at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home service sector.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent per annum may be particularly painful in addition to ongoing expenses.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food managers, and only weather will show whether the more temperate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the much-desired break.”
Total sales growth at pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand deployment.

One in five children hides a secret social media profile from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have a secret social network profile that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study reveals.
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
News has heightened fears that sexually explicit material may be published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “basic” profile that they show their parents.
One in five children – some one in 11 – creates a profile on a social network that is kept secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed growth in fake Insta accounts – a link to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears that material with sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean “basic” profile that they showed to their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage child who encouraged others to “rape her.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Aileed Doyle to be the "Voice of Athletes" at Scotland's Athletics Board
Eileed Doyle was elected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as the non-executive director of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most accomplished athlete, and Chairman Ian Beaty described this move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to take advantage of her rich international experience over the past decade.
“Eilid enjoys tremendous respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are convinced that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from attracting her,” said Beethoven.
Doyle said: “I have a desire to be the voice of the athletes and I really hope to be able to contribute and help promote sport in Scotland.”
The American who won the 200m and 400m finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, lost the ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved a full recovery, learned to walk again and today I am doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
An advertisement for a breast pump that compares mothers with cows, divides online opinions
A company that produces breast pumps split the online posts with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with breastfeeding cows.
To mark the launch of the expected “world’s first wearable silent breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a humorous music-video commercial to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives breastfeeding women to express themselves.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cowboy’s hedge, full of hay, against the backdrop of a song that reads, “Yes, I’m breastfeeding, but you don’t see any tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not you, it’s my breasts.”
The song goes on: “Pump, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, breastfeed my girlfriends.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it demeaned the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth.”

Another comment: “It is perfectly understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: “So inadequate advertising.”
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she thought the song was “extremely fun.”
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel just like a cow.
Advertisement is a bit crazy, but I accept it for what it is.
This product is genius,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a ridiculous ad aimed at mothers who bark (often at their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their sutures.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many lactating women feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and is discreetly assembled in a nursing bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go outside while they are squeezing.
Ana Ballarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves to be boldly and provocatively marketed.
By drawing a parallel between nursing and breastfeeding cows, we wanted to focus on the drainage of breast milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has come into the mainstream.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium for designer Martha Jakubovski, using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved Secretly to Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policy has made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Typically, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other seniors in the family should provide fingerprints, with this data to be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of persons who are either guardians or members of the guardian’s family reside illegally in the country, the majority of whom are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these people,” Albens said.
In an effort to speed up the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conference call, not in person, to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed inappropriate for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become oppressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to flee, according to shelter officials and reports that came out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said this concern is growing at large facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored due to the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to the “tent city” without giving them enough time to prepare on an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the civil war that has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign troops are illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "relevant action will be taken against them".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Muallem insisted that "the war on terror is nearing its end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands are cleared” of both terrorist organizations and “any illegal presence of foreigners.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrians, the opposition of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the lands of the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Muallem said the conditions were tolerable and could return, accusing "some Western states of "inflating groundless fears" that prompted refugees to stay away."
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns,” he said.
“They’re turning something into a political issue that’s a completely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be provided for Syria’s reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Muallem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra front, who will be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft Syria’s post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why will Trump win a second term?
According to this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless – as many liberals hope – his presidency is terminated prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the Primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is at the top of the cable ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news dinners.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC’s “The Last Candidate,” where he talks about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, who is a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Mrs. Scowl told me that he replied, “Because she makes me laugh.”
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that is shown on television, coming out of Washington stories can determine the future of Row vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the good condition of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to that in six hours of watching a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who used "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's pilot's jacket of ostrich leather for $15,000.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does to make you feel like part of a reality show is to give you a little bit every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer at Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of Pawn Stars.

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny on the north bank of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he had locked himself up at home watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Kavanaugh had to face the legal committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
“I remember a time when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” he told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Investments are pouring into the most contested race in the early election for a seat in Congress
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th county receives a stream of money thanks to the reorganization of Congressional counties and hence two holders of the same seat.
The recently redistributed county in the Pittsburgh suburbs named conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another county in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faces another incumbent, Republican Keith Rotfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is significantly advocating the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely debated partial election in March for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The position has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts believe that Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador because of its support for China, then withdrew.
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with some pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions no longer to recognize Taiwan,” Department of State spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
Sanctions were only envisaged against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. anti-drug aid for development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts to financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American state with its unemployment and homicide rate.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity, which serves as a continuation of a similar gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent an influx of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials said they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will attend the conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new harsh announcements or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who wished to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, which is currently a significant piece of evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body just as he prepares to face the electorate, and perhaps also to the jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I am not suggesting that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable – not even that of those like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make those choices that will affect how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, as long as the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the ensuing years of slaughter.
The course of history depends on such nodal moments, and the relentless march of democracy is either speeding up or slowing down.
At the moment, Americans are facing several similar hurdles.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported last year that he had secretly proposed to enroll the president and had speculated that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story in the Times was inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh, demanded by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false witnessing?
And most importantly, will we vote in early congressional elections if that forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail at these trials, democracy has a long winter ahead of it.
But I believe that we will not fail because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Shabbat candles on that table wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorans of the Rangers is optimistic about the collision with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a win over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to continue ahead of Group D in the Europa League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorans to play his first game of the season before the 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believed that for the Rangers this result could become a springboard to greater achievements.
“We won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent,” said the 31-year-old.
“We entered the game with the hope that we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall, equality seems like a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second.
We have a look at Thursday, another big night of our games in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can give our best and achieve a good result.
“Last year was definitely tough after everything that happened besides my injuries and changes at the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team is good and the guys really have fun, the training is beneficial.
I hope that we will be able to make every effort to forget last season and achieve the desired success.”
Women Are Worried About Their Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the respondents in the Nationwide survey said they had discussed with their spouses the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven’t taken steps to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you unless you make your wishes known in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a crucial factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions when choosing a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover these costs, or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the monetary resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles right from the start.
Appoint a health care representative so that you have a designated trustee to oversee your medical care provided and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the idea of an attorney on financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is traveling to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Put these details in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, it’s also about who the doctors will be,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the death toll to rise.
Due to interrupted communications, relief organizations are unable to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a regency that extends for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, has an approximate population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of the Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been overwhelmed several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami struck the western part of the Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic “Pacific Ring of Fire” and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26 on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatra triggered a wave of tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the entire coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude quake hit Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake strikes near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentaway Islands and triggered a 10-metre wave of tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Paddy Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation from the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy quakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them from the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in a deadlock.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, a 29-year-old man from Wasila, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a domestic violence report and resistance to arrest, according to a report by state police in Alaska published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and under an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "innocent, certainly" when asked to plead, the media reported.
Palin is threatened with a penalty for three Class A offenses, which means he can be detained for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal charge has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social networks there are videos that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when a wave of tsunamis swept across the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Want Rare Death Penalty for Suspect in New York Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October attack on a bike lane near the West Side highway in lower Manhattan, walking pedestrians and cyclists along his way.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent in connection with the death penalty request filed in Southern District, New York.
According to the court document, both charges may result in the death penalty.
Weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal judicial panel filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, including eight racket-related murder charges commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of the ICC.
The attack required “serious planning and intent,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s manner as “terrible, cruel and perverted.”
“Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Lauri Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Earley, Hernan Feliuci and Alejandro Damian Panuko.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last South District of New York sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was executed in New York City was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek by nationality, showed no feeling of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“In our view, the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a sentence of guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all those affected,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously requested the prosecutor's office not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative MP Says Nail Farah Should Lead Brexit Negotiations <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the people's army" today, during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "feel pressure" - as one of the party's own members suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have left by now" if Farage had been secretary of Brexit affairs.
But the challenge faced by Ms May to reconcile with the deeply divided ranks of the party was underlined by conservatives supporting the stay, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his “Chequers” compromise plan despite the attacks from Brexit supporters, EU supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions, and urge Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr Bon told protesters in Solihull with the slogan “Going out means going out” that he wanted to “discard the Chequers”.
He pointed out that Mr Farage had to participate on an equal footing with the others and that he had to be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would have left by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be slaves.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Bonn rejected the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The notion that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.”
Conservative spokeswoman Andrea Jenkins also attended the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually took to the streets and actually helped us get elected.
Please leave "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians should “feel pressure” if they intend to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about the trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to change Brexit and we’re here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had raised flags with inscriptions “Conservatives Against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the security issues of the party’s application when it opened at the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can deploy Canada’s IT systems and all of Canada’s technology and more, and more, for unhindered border crossing, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren says he will "reconsider seriously" his presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider seriously the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a city council meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Deale, who was the co-chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she could take the post of Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall after Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women at the top.”
Arrested for the death of Simms from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect in the shooting on Friday when LSU basketball player Wade Simms was killed.
Button Rose Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University area early Friday morning.
"Wayde Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was seamlessly arrested and detained in the East Baton Rouge Municipal Police Department arrest.
A 6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims participated in 32 games with 10 starts as a starter last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 fights per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team’s instructions helped him defeat Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that directions from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two laps, allowing Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the race's exit.
The Mercedes also made a pit-stop on the next lap and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton managed to outrun him after a bold maneuver and driving "rubber to tire", which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly release the inner part of the track to avoid overtime.
On top of his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
He then even led the race for a fairly long period of time, as he had decided to change his tires later than the rest, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually outpace Kimi Rykonen in the battle for fourth place.
He finally entered for a pit-stop in the 44th lap, but failed to make enough progress in the next eight laps and eventually Rykonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day as Walter did a great job all weekend and proved to be a real gentleman when he let me out.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first two places on the podium," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her allegation that she had not distributed the letter from Christine Blaise Ford, accusing the Supreme Court suitor Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “bad and disgusting and dishonest.”
“What can happen to the good things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil and disgusting and insincere,” he said.
“When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You know what I mean?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread it?
Do you remember her response... Did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t spread it.”
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we have distributed ... No, we have not distributed,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Cavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September – but Feinstein denies that it occurred from her office.
"I did not cover up Ford's allegations, I did not spread her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it private, and I kept it private as she wished.”
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the claimant to the Supreme Court accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president pointed out that Democrats are using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
"Look at the dishonor, shame, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to have to run over to regain power and control," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants, defeating the Dundee rematch 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants led early in the game with two goals after hitting Patrick Dwyer and Frances Bouvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney leveled for the hosts before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals confirmed their victory.
This is the third Elite League win for Adam Keefe's boys, who pulled out of the bottom to defeat Dundy in Belfast by 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The hit with which Dwyer found the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the assistance of Kendall McFaul, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance, assisting the Bouvier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped set up with the help of Cooney at 15:16.
Dwyer tried to lead the Giants before the first break, scoring a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar again equalized the odds with a powerful knock on the door at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time this match at the end of the second half, giving his best and consolidating the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who lost the last four games out of a total of five games, are hosting Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight attendant died to make sure that hundreds of people aboard a plane could escape from an earthquake.
A flight attendant in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers on board was able to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a wave of tsunamis.
Strong secondary quakes continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung has refused to step down from his post at the heavily shaken control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jaffrey Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, would be able to fly out safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he decided it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian Air Control spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong was limited.
"We expect that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people cannot be reached," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Waves that reached six meters devastated Palu, where a mass burial took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There's bullshit everywhere in the mini-markets."
Ian Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Now Announces One Man Is Unknown After Airplane Crash in Lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been declared missing after earlier declaring that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said they could not contact a male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane went down very low.
“That’s very nice,” Janes says.
Janes tells us that he and the others managed to walk through the deep water to the cross to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy says seafarers repairing the nearby harbour also helped with the rescue operation by using an inflatable boat to take people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Safety Aviation Network indicates that over the past two decades, 111 people have died on flights with airlines registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulet of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone tapes to assemble the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Roulet said she had received location data from several mobile phones indicating that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was outside the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked him if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said, “That’s a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is that Telis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks before her death.
Records from mobile phones indicate that they had only known each other for a week.
Roulet said that shortly after Chambers' death, she had deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscientious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke negative opinions about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip-hop has deviated from its origins of political statements and engagement with social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and re-promote conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York babysitter sues a couple after being fired for a "racist" message
A New York babysitter is suing a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving an erroneous message from a mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist by equating the desire to “extort”.
Lensy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was surprised to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEE, BEFORE BLACK”, wrote in a text message Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was an African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipina.
Mrs. Morris was rewarded for a working day then sent home by taxi.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, demanding the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was originally hired, although she did not have a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you shouldn’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “You’re sure that’s discrimination.”
In response to the request, the couple claimed they were not racists, adding that terminating Maurice's employment was a reasonable act, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco, his husband, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Similar to the demand for "extortion", Plasco claims that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
That’s not particularly nice,” added the investment banker.
While the case is still under consideration, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks, denouncing them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not feel a connection with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, tells of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It’s a lot of fun now that we’re aware of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little bear toy, would feel optimistic about a possible rejection of the book, adding that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the book's publication.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family,” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
“He was a fairly modest man and he wasn’t self-pleasing,” she said.
“But since you felt Paddington was so real, it’s like having a child who’s accomplished something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your business.
I think you kind of accepted Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“He was constantly calling to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn’t expect to survive,” said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to say she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicines given to her by doctors to sustain her heart slowly cease to work and leave her system.
She's gone some time before, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this is happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to tighten up.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is still grieving for the loss of her daughter, boards the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the trial she is going through.
“Nobody knows,” she said.
“I had my head up and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this all-encompassing sense of empathy with Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Saddened women put cards in order to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women, who have lost their loved ones to suicide, try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries put on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis’s son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Leeds, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminates every room.
However, he gave up his job before leaving, and was in a “really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences.”
Ms. Davis creates the cards, “to let people know that there’s someone to go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, loses Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t share that he felt depressed or depressed, or anything else,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas—when the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t look at them or anything.”
She said it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “It opens a gap in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in question after the FBI begins an investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wants — an investigation of limited duration and scope — maybe we could join forces," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would "disintegrate" despite a firm over-party blockade.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to investigate?
Their unwillingness is due to the moment.
The early elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 – if Republicans are not expected to perform well, their attempts to elect their representative to the highest court in the state will be seriously affected.
George W. Bush called senators inviting them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees is "decreasing" under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Beeong Sug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706.
According to Park, tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher amounts demanded from human smugglers, are key factors.
There is no official comment from Pyongyang.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually granted citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and crosses more easily than the tightly guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalemate in nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to generally work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and in these circumstances there is no way we can first unilaterally disarm ourselves," Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit for the Supreme Court.
Congressional minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost shouted and felt sorry when discussing his family and his pupil years.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on the personality” organized by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it has become clear that he is biased towards the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and the way he persecutes the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and if Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he’s unfit not only to go to the Supreme Court, but to the court where he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings regarding the Affordable Health Care Act or the Row v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’”
And women need to be mastered.
This is a reasonable criticism, after months and years of spreading anger, and she cannot accept it without weeping.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinam told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere who shared that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her own technique, thanks to which when she was angry and crying, she said to her interlocutor, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm mad."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed when expressing anger, in part because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job, in an office mostly with men, was how once, as I blinked in an inexpressible rage, a woman older than me grabbed my neck – a chilling leader I’ve always been a little afraid of – and she dragged me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you crying,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a yacht called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was to have another one.
Someone called the situation “The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As she joins the campaign late, she lags behind in raising funds and decides that she will not stay in the race if she fails to raise $2 million.
The battle is prematurely doomed to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would give only $250 to her.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was filled with so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and to be able to turn to the voters, not to the delegates, as well as anger against sex.
“You might think I’ve had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted.
“Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my grave plate?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Serve Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were daunting, and while the battle is just gaining momentum, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched his first warning leap this year by taxing key elements of China’s exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions came this week with new tariffs affecting US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) production with effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time, Beijing retaliated with new counter-attacks of five to ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to retaliate against any U.S. strike, and it is not expected that the world’s second-largest economy will soon ignore this.
To get Washington to give up is to give in to the demands, but to lower your head publicly in front of Washington would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run to reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in either of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a U.S. security scientist for the new Asia-related expert group.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asked for assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by the war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muhammad said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by the terrorists in order to restore them to their normal state.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Mulayam said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional support or assistance will not be accepted from countries that have financed the rebels.
Europe wins the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider's Cup, beating the U.S. team with a 16.5 to 10.5 finish at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won a Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its championship crown in the tournament after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn reached the necessary 14.5 points, which ensured victory over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickleson, who performed poorly for most of the tournament, delayed his first blow to the 16th hole (with a "pair" 3) in the water, losing his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari performed excellently in all rounds, becoming one of four players in the history of the tournament to reach a 5-0-0 balance since the race was held in the current format since 1979.
U.S. striker Jordan Speed lost 5&4 to Europe's lowest-ranked player, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
World leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, for whom this is probably the last ride of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight runs in the Rider Cup, became the European with the most points in the tournament of all time, this year increasing his asset to 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stand it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
The most important thing is the team and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said after Europe’s victory.
He handed over the staff to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play," Ram said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and his overall Ryder Cup balance is now 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 major titles – an indicator that only Jack Niklaus gave up.
The U.S. team experienced difficulties throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-end golf on all days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning we pressed the team of Europe.
There was a battle.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players performed very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Association of Professional Golfers and our Rider Cup Committee, and look only forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just overjoyed.”
