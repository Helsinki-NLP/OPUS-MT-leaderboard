Black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of money to improve the collapsing highway system, many people are looking at its solution in a small black box, which fits neatly on your car’s dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor-driver and transmits that information to the authorities, is nowadays obsolete to finance major roads in the United States. The system is designed to revive the state of Washington and the state planning offices of Vijayawada.
Generally, boring work such as highway planning has also suddenly become a subject of intense debate and lively alliances.
Keeping details of the miles you drive, and possibly the location you drive—and then using this information to prepare a tax bill—has met with libertarian environmental groups to gather support in favour of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The tea party is amazing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether further action should be taken, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how in the next decade they can go into a system in which the driver pays for each mile set on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for test drives, some of which are GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether or not we choose," said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, who plans to start tracking every mile set by motorists in California by 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country’s highway trust fund has almost gone bankrupt, which is funded by paying taxes on gas pumps by U.S. citizens.
Americans don't buy the same amount of gas as they used to.
The car is now running more than a mile in a gallon of gas.
There has been no increase in federal taxes in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians also avoid raising a dollar in taxes.
Transportation policy expert Lee Munikh at the University of Minnesota says, "Gas tax is not at all conducive."
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run, this will work as the most rational option."
Wonx calls it the mileage-based user fee.
It’s not surprising that this idea looks good to urban liberals, as it can lead to changes in taxes to change the way people drive, for example, which can help reduce traffic jams and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
California’s planners are eager for this system as they are developing strategies to meet the goals set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transportation Committee, Rip. Bill Shuster (APA) also considers the black box to be the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors in the Region Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
"It's not just doing what's going into the blind pit,"" said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the regime."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries, who in their report in 2011 granted the Congress the grace to move in the direction of per-mile payments.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing individuals who had to walk too many miles to go to work or to the city every day, the leadership of the House ended that proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
It has the most desirable Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of taxing the state.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test, he said.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along with the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was recently installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers, the drivers were very eager to think that the government could monitor every step of it.
Alauddin Khan, who directs Strategic and Action-Performance Management in the Nevada Transport Department, says, "The Big Brother and other similar things were a major concern."
This is not what people wanted.
As the test progressed, the ACLU of Nevada had warned on its website: "It will be quite easy to convert this device into a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop a huge, unmanageable technology structure-structure, which would necessarily have to be spread to keep records of every person's day-to-day visits.
Nevada is among the many states that are making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details of how many miles a car is running per day, but not where and when it is running.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device it is testing appealed to highway planners, as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a fixed time interval.
"If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more willing to adopt this way,"" Tru Mileage's chief executive Ryan Morrison said."
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are also very low-cost and low-interference ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are using to give drivers different choices.
They can choose the device of GPS containing or without GPS.
Or again no one can choose not to take the device, but can choose to pay the fee fixed on the basis of the average miles determined by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to concerned citizens by providing less rather than more convenience in the device.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop such a taxing device, which will also have the facility to pay the parking meter fee, provide insurance of "Payment according to your drive", and generate real-time speed recovery data from other drivers that will be collected
The city planning document mentions, "Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation due to the benefits derived from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps the whole discussion of pay per mile is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Gulf region has said that by increasing the Congress gas tax, the bankruptcy highway trust fund can be dealt with very easily.
Hybrid or other car drivers may also be charged an additional one-time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their fair share.
The Commission's Legislation and Public Affairs Director, Randy Rentsheller, said, "What is the need for mulch surgery when aspirin can work?"
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
According to the police, his death was due to drowning.
However, his friend has been detained by the police on suspicion of hiding the belongings of the deceased.
The police have handed over the final report of the death investigation to the court.
On August 26, police recovered the body of Zaid Iqbal, who lives in the Padshahi Garden in Jhelam Dariya.
Her family had accused her of murdering her friends because her mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
The woman said in an interview that she was given the phone by a relative of hers, Rohal Gauhar.
Spirit also lives in the royal garden and he was a friend of the deceased Zaid.
Spirit was bathed in Jhelum with Zaid after prayer-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zaid uncovered his clothes and put all his belongings on the side, while Rohal went to the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he returned, Zaid was not there, only his clothes.
The Spirit searched for Zaid, but he did not find him.
He then picked up his cell phone, watch and other belongings and kept them for his own use.
He didn't tell anyone that Jade was drowned.
The police told the court that Jahid's death was due to drowning and his death has been confirmed in the post-mortem.
However, the Spirit has been detained under Section 404 to conceal the facts and belongings of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, has married a 28-year-old girl in a highly intelligent manner.
The announcement was made by his family friend Marthel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in her private chapel three times as prime minister.
Francesca met Balusconi when she was a tennis activist at the Forza Italia party.
It is there that Francesca, about whose relationship was being told that her relationship with Balrusconi is merely a show.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl Marthel Polanco has revealed that she was also invited to this intelligence wedding.
The ceremony took place three weeks ago.
When asked what would happen if the two got married on Italian Radio2, Polanco said that they were both already married and that they would be married.
It was not a public function.
The wedding took place in a private chapel in the former Prime Minister's house.
Apart from that, no one can say anything.
However, she did not attend this wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to the new couple.
The two got married about three weeks ago, i.e. on 8 or 9 October.
Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman, was engaged to her husband about 8 months ago.
Berlusconi had laid the groundwork for loneliness behind this decision to avoid Kirkuri.
Even in the lower regions, the rains continued to stop between the eyes of the sun.
With this, the chill has started in the entire plaintiff.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, in Gulmarg -0.2 degrees below zero and in Leh -1.8 degrees Celsius.
Leah was the coldest in the entire state.
The Srinagar-Leh National Highway has been closed to traffic due to the rain and snowfall.
There has been heavy snowfall on the Jojila Ridge.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activation of the Western upheaval, it was only in the high-altitude areas of the plaintiffs that the snowfall and rainfall in the lower areas began, which continued until late evening.
Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People stayed in their homes to avoid cold weather.
In the meantime, power supply in many areas has also stalled.
The maximum temperature of the day in Srinagar was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius below four degrees below normal.
Even in Jammu, the night has been colder due to heavy rains and strong winds.
The minimum temperature in Jammu was 16.6 and the maximum was 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of the Western eruption has been decreasing and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lots, director of the Srinagar-based Meteorological Department, the weather is likely to remain dry in the plaintiff from November 1st to November 7th.
Asaram, who was imprisoned on charges of sexual harassment, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued on behalf of Asaram, he is being presented as a dracula drinking children's blood, but the court dismissed his demand to ban media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P Satshivam has refused to order the media to stop running news about Asaram saying he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere with it.
How can we stop them when they are receiving information from the police and other people?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer alleged to the media that he was showing up the news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They filed a case against whom, but the bench was not affected by these arguments and denied interfering in the case, saying they have more options.
Earlier, the court had rejected the demand for a ban on media coverage.
Department officials have claimed that this is the largest TDS theft case to date.
The mall's group director paid to the relevant financial institutions by cutting the TDS, but did not pay it in government treasury.
In doing so, he kept depositing the rupee of the TDS with himself.
On October 17, the Jaipur Investigation Team, who arrived from Mumbai, took action on the group.
The same investigation revealed that the trader had cut the TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team had launched an Income Tax Survey on this group on Thursday.
The group of the mall manager was raided and surveyed about 15 days before the threat of account seal.
Annoyed by the action, the trader has made it clear to Income Tax Department officials that they are not ready to pay the Income Tax Department the rupee of TDS at this time.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them.
The investigating authorities have made it clear that recovery action will be taken by sealing the account in case of non-payment.
Due to Diwali, the demand for sweets increases.
With this, sales of mints and fakes are on the rise.
Sweets are used to make more luminous, colorful and sweet chemicals, which are dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a campaign against counterfeit mava and chemical sweets.
The department seized 5,000 light bulbs from Madhya Pradesh, 70,000 from the Mawa and 5,000 from the Quetta colonies.
The demand for sweets in the market as well as the demand for minuscule maize from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The Madhya Pradesh-based Nagpur Information Department has been informed that the mavericks have been brought to Nagpur from Madhya Pradesh.
Nagpur is being transported from the transport garage to Nagpur.
The department took possession of the mower, which was priced at Rs 70,000.
Fear of action did not entitle anyone to Maeve.
The department destroyed it by declaring it an unclaimed property.
The department recovered about 5,000 lights from the Jitendra Catters in Quetta Colony.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulphite was used to glow and last for a long time.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S.S. Deshmukh, Co-Commissioner of the Department, said that the campaign for seizure of chemical sweets and minced and counterfeit maws will continue.
In the next few days, this information has been provided by the Department of Campaign and Acceleration.
The consumption of these sweets can also cause poisoning.
The department urged sweeteners to make good milk, sweets from Mave.
People have been urged by the Department to be wary of fake sweets and poppy seeds.
The 42 senior leaders of the BJP, who were elected from the state, welcomed him at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come on a visit to Bihar for a consolation trip organised by the BJP.
The condolences will be given to the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is noteworthy that a total of seven blasts occurred in Patna on October 27 during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally.
The intention of the terrorists of Indian Mujahideen involved in the blasts was to incite riots during the rally, so that more people were killed and the atmosphere of terror in the state was created.
The intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people died in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The leaders of the party have been on their way from their villages since Thursday.
On November 5, all of these bones will be transported together to the Ganga in Patna.
As part of this journey, a consolation journey is organized.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
He will visit the villages of those killed in the blasts from 7 a.m. on Saturday.
During the meeting, they will also provide a check of Rs five to five to the families of the deceased.
This financial aid has already been announced by the BJP.
Excited by the explosive win in the last match, the Indian team on Saturday will have to capture the series with a win when it lands in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at M Chinnaswamy Stadium.
India had to win the Nagpur ODIs at any given time to stay in the series after two consecutive ODIs were washed away due to rain and its batsmen gave it a record win, equalling the team 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has scored twice the goal of more than 350 runs and once again the responsibility for crossing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and the big goal is also proving to be damp in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great shape, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also remain strong hopes for the team.
As far as the opening is concerned, Rohit and the top team have found a salute pair that is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat the opportunity to play without any pressure.
In the third place, Kohli is considered Sachin Tendulkar of the future by the Virat that he has performed so far.
Rather, many cricket pandits have made them even better than Sachin.
Virat Kohli has scored 17 ODIs next week, of which India has won 16.
His average is above 80.00 while pursuing the goal and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but the high dependency on these three could also be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were badly flopped in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened an account in two matches in the series.
A good innings 'Lifeline' could work for him in the Bengaluru ODI.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with his performance.
He is also being asked to join the Test team for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen to the ninth position.
Besides Beli, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voggs and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch did not leave any impact in the opening.
The shortage of Michelle Johnson in bowling can be huge for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home for Ashes series preparations.
BJP National Executive member and chief spokesman Dr Jitendra Singh said Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists in the face of this apparent peace.
Referring to a report by intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing for a heel peak to infiltrate nearly 2000 terrorists ready to enter its training camps.
For this, he will never let there be peace on the border.
Pakistan has become even more unhappy after the separatists have failed to incite the people of Kashmir to aggravate the situation on a large scale.
Referring to last year's visit of the separatists to Pakistan, the BJP leader said that ISI chief lieutenant general Zahir ul Islam, Lashkar, Sargana Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahudin of Hizb had given confidence that terrorism had come to hawa in 2014.
"Pakistan is committed to fulfilling this pledge.
The killings of soldiers at the border, suicide bombings in Samba, Hiranagar are part of the same strategy.
Calling the demand to abolish the privileges of the army in the state as deadly, the BJP leader said it is also anti-people to do such things until there is a lasting peace in the state.
These are the anti-national elements.
He stressed that statements of the army of the leaders, the moral defeat of the security forces should be stopped.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. curiosity
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence official, has announced that he is ready to visit Berlin to testify to parliament in Germany if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, fail to respond about their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stroh Belle, met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has been given asylum to speak about testifying in Germany.
In a letter presented by Mr. Snowden to the media in Berlin on Friday, MEPs said: "Although the results of my efforts are verifiably positive, my government party considers disagreement - as a change, and no defences that are made against the accusations of misunderstandings."
Truth be told, however, is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dan said that he believes that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
The allegations filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include spying and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Online Zeit: "If Mr. Snow Dane is preparing to speak to German authorities, we will have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA claims it has buged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, MP who is chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees intelligence information. He said that even if the opportunity to testify to Mr. Snow Dan Kosunne were to be "without completely destroying relations with the United States and putting them at risk," it should be taken.
Mrs. Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of herself with Mr. Snow Dan on Twitter feed.
He was on a trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mrs. Bellen said, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left Russia.
If Snowden testified in the Netherlands, he would be "safe" there with the assurances needed, the MP said.
In his letter, Mr. Snow Dan said that he had to leave the house because he had to face a "bhayankar and sustained campaign."
However, he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by wide-ranging responses "to his work of political expression."
The United States, including - the world's citizens as well as senior officials - is targeting the unveiling of an irresponsible system of comprehensive surveillance of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the human situation have been solved."
Airline carriers will be charged for baggage.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for carry-on baggage for passengers on board its aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for $100 for a carry-on bag and this, will charge a $2 fee for coffee or soda, though its announcement on Wednesday indicated that passengers can hold the entire box.
The new carry-on is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, the small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 would have to wait if passengers waited to pay until they were at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be earned to take care of the charge in advance of the passengers.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger charges are filling up as much as they can carry-on baggage that is stashed in the overhead compartment, which means this compartment often has less space.
There is a way to bring less for passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It has become increasingly difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find the place of the overhead bin.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website do not have to give it.
This means that the next person in the line may have to give $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a frontier gate, can receive a bag for free.
O'Malley said the Frontier's website and check-in processes are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fees before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new carrier - on fees, will not start until summer although a date has not been set.
Passengers often reveal dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but air services like them.
They argue that it costs money to handle the baggage, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them don't even have a carry-on bag fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. launched Carry-on-Charge for the first time three years ago, and partner discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with such a fee is Wizz Air of another airline, which is the airline's advisor, J Sorensen, and who tracks the add-on fee.
Spirit's Carry-On brings in $50 million a year as estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines officer, recently flew into Spirit and surprised passengers had to face a carry-on baggage fee at the gate.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and he climbed it lickety-split."
Frontier is also following the $2 fee of Spirit's for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier says that those who take soda, or juice, can keep the whole box, and will give this free coffee only once.
It will still give off water.
U.S. Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but seven months after the passengers complained they withdrew and followed suit after no other major airlines were there.
Frontier's Passengers is its fresh effort to drive customers towards its own website if they don't purchase directly from the airline to charge on-carry-on charges.
The airline pays the online travel seller Orbitz for such a $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
That’s why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those instead of going through an online travel agency.
The frontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September, many frequent flights began to give half a mile away to customers who had purchased from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It is also that they allow the sole passengers to choose their seat in advance on purchase directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier's Denver has a loyal customer base in its home town, but its business is shrinking and it's losing money.
Revenue declined 9% and its flying capacity decreased nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to determine the finances of Frontier as part of the sale of the airline.
The NSA accused the hackers of "internal error" rather than the website crashing.
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website had been shut down for a few hours due to some technical deficiencies, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
"Tonight, NSA.gov was not available for several hours, which was due to an internal error occurring during the predetermined update," the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved tonight.
It is not true that the claim came as a result of the obstruction, distributed denial of service [DDOS] attack.
On the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA's website was shut down for at least six hours, and the site is still not accessible to some users.
A spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that there was "absolutely no" agreement with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one activist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NOS website by attacking the D.D.O.S.
The D.D.O.S. attack is designed in such a way that so much traffic is sent to the target website until the site is shut down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and the aim of the attacks is not to differentiate the internal network of the target system.
Formerly highly mysterious NSA, which was once dubbed "Such No Agency" by S.S.A.S.A., has become the subject of widespread discussion and harsh criticism by S.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A. who collectively became the subject of S.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A. in recent months
Due to the thus growing controversy over the agency, speculations were made following the incident tonight that the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the narrative 'One more Dronacharya' showing harmony in the times of the Dwapar and the circumstances of today.
It is shown in today's relation which chains a guru is forced to walk in the wrong way.
The play was launched jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhupadayal Walmiki, Vice President of the Camp Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh.
The drama depicted the Dronacharya of the Davapar era and the commonality of the circumstances of Professor Arvind at present.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goyal, Sama Samar, Wanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc.
The play was created by young painter Jitendra C. Raj and set designer Hemant Kumar.
In addition, various awards were awarded to the literary, culturally contributing innovators on behalf of OPTA at the function.
Dr. Asalam Jamsheedpuri, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and Jitendra C. Raj, Urdu department president, were present at the event.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi and others contributed to the success of the event.
Bombardier's profits decline as aircraft delivery, orders decline
Canada's aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter in its rail unit and under pressure from aircraft orders and deliveries on contract issues.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not introduced an update on issues that will complete its ambitious program to release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or to go into commercial service from next September.
Almost another half a month after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has only been blasted three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell below forecast and the stock has been sent for more than 8 percent slide in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst stock with the National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating for "field performance" from "matt" to "field performance."
"We were mostly expecting weaker aircraft deliveries, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Doorsen said in a customer note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as the progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, the market program will be suspicious.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut it off at the lower end of the dominant market of Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after a month of delay.
Potential buyers await the results of the flight test to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as for CSeries sure orders up to 177.
403 full orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Boudoin was confident that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time it first put the jet into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was running as scheduled.
"The test aircraft remained on the ground longer than predicted," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that it was also determined during the intervals of ground testing and software updates.
Each manufacturer creates the schedule in a different way.
We have decided to make a first flight and an update period and said what we have done.
That's why everything will be through the flight program.
The other remaining parts of the five test planes are expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are suspecting that customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said that it has evaluated the service entry (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our idea that the service will be pushed into Q1/15 at the entrance," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion were expected.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said 45 aircraft were delivered below 57 a year ago, during the quarter
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
Backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, no change from December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the lower order of intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
Aerospace revenues fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said the world's largest train manufacturer, the division had increased revenues by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The orders in the transport unit were backloged to about $32.6 billion on September 30, up from a modest 31 December.
Some major contracts in the margins of the Transport Division were also affected by execution issues.
Executive officials said the new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
In Bombardier's shares, in which the chief financial officer of Google Inc, Patrick Pichett, announced joining the board, mid-noon trading on Thursday also fell by 8.5 percent to C$ 4.83.
Brazil's Umbrella SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest rival to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
You don't lie to anyone and you don't think about stealing or cheating.
But in the evening our minds change and we begin to walk against the rule of setting aside the ideal.
Researchers at Harvard University and the David Eccles School of Business in Utah have given a number of interesting facts.
According to the researchers, without the stress of morning work, we prefer moral values, but in the evening the honesty decreases due to fatigue or more pressure.
For this, the researchers used two methods.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell them whether the point is more to the left or to the right.
The participants were told that if they responded incorrectly instead of the correct answer, they would be given money.
In this experiment, it was observed that those who were tested between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistakes and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, while using people between 12 noon and 6 p.m., it was found that they deliberately misrepresented their motives.
As a result, researchers have succeeded in proving that the greed for money in the morning does not matter to our honesty, but in the evening we stop giving in to ethics.
This research has been published in the recent issue of Psychological Science.

Cocaine addiction lawyer arrested for giving secret information about police investigation to Mr. Bigg
42-year-old Bashrat Ditta had informed the notorious criminal Neil Scarboro
The lawyer thought that people might find out about his confidential drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The top lawyer of the defence, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he feared people would find out about his secret drug addiction, has been jailed for three years.
42-year-old Barshat Ditta, after making a compromise due to his cocaine addiction, provided the notorious criminal Neil Scarboro with sensitive information about his investigation into drug smuggling activities.
This lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash", and who was praised as "Top Brief" by the criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous Narcotics Trial.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarborough holding three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he had gone out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
After finding cocaine particles in Detta's hair, wallets, and credit cards, the investigation revealed that Detta was a "regular user" of drugs of category A.
During the eight-month period from January to August 2011, she illegally sought information on behalf of Scarboro and his associates about the arrest of two people.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at the time as part of the main investigation of heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other people who were sent to jail after the police seized 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash, during several raids.
The 42-year-old Detta provided information to the criminals, fearing that people would not know about her cocaine addiction.
Detta, a law firm working at Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty in two cases of obstructing the way of justice after a trial lasted three weeks in Liverpool Crown Court. Failure to face in Liverpool Crown Court today
He had admitted to holding cocaine in the previous hearing.
The bad time for the lawyer started when police found out while investigating Scarboro that he had been in regular contact with Detta on the phone since February 2011.
Two spies chased the suspect and saw him coming to Detta's house and holding more than 60 per cent of the purity of the drug under the lawyer's dock in Black Golf Glove.
Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta after the drug was placed, who had gone out for dinner at Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer arrived at the house, he found out that the drug had been placed there and that there had been nine conversations between them.
The court heard that he was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the test when a drug of category A was found on Ditta's hair, wallets and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but was denied cocaine use and said she was talking to the suspected dealer because he was her client and said his discussion was a subject of "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta pulled out his wallet and tried to remove a lot of credit cards, but he was seized, and his hair was sampled.
In the police interview, she said she ran the office from her workplace as well as from her home, and her clients called her home for legal matters.
After telling the main arrested persons what the spies knew about them, it was stated in the court hearing that Detta was calling the chiefs of the drug supply chain, some of whom had filed the case earlier.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said: "Criminal lawyers should know best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, too much to associate with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a general drug dealer, but rather of a dealer who is providing the drug to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly have been legal, without a doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his own boundary of lawyer-client relationship.
He interrupted the police investigation as far as possible so that they would be able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but insulting.
He made too much contact with certain clients, especially with Scarborough, and he allowed an agreement of his own free will.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Hallstead said: "At the same time that Mr. Ditta started receiving drug from organized criminals, he turned himself from criminal lawyer to criminal."
Due to his cocaine addiction, he made excessive compromises and became much weaker towards the objectives of leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of loyalty, and have confidence and confidence in the people.
Shri Ditta has cheated with this belief and has tried to avoid in his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lankashir investigated Mr. Ditta, who was also found guilty of three incidents of holding cocaine and now obstructing the path of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing the criminals to court.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no person is far from the reach of the law.
We will search for you and present you to the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of plotting to supply heroin, cocaine and hemp.
Fifty other members of the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On her website, Ditta gave a question-and-answer session about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for a client with the death penalty in the United States, to be a dinner guest of Muhammad Ali and to inspire inequality for his work.
Kenya's press is outraged by the controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying, "This is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is it to prevent Parliament from taking away the freedom of the judiciary tomorrow?"
Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group - which is Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM - said, "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it."
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is a part of the government itself" and that banning subject-matter and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"""I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send the MPs back,"" he said."
According to The Star News-Letter, the new bill will provide the government with "strict control over the media," while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have been "striked" and called the bill cruel.
The bill is being passed in September as one of the measures to strengthen national security after an attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenya's media had broadcast security camera footage of the gunmen sent to the site of the attack, showing them deliberately looting the mall, causing officials to get angry with Kenya's media.
Police chief David Kimyo had summoned two journalists and media workers for questioning, though the summons was withdrawn after the media rioted.
Under the new bill, 2 crore Kenyan shillings and 10 lakh Kenyan shillings could be fined to individual journalists on media companies and, in addition, "removal from the list" or additional risk of not being officially recognized by the press.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "A single metric is enough to shake the foundation of most F.M. stations."
It also said that these measures could have the destructive effects described as Kenya's "living blogosphere."
By shutting the mouth of the media, politicians know that they can do their bidding.
The nation's journalist Mutuma Matthew writes, describing Kenyan media as the main source of control and balance in public life, "no one will ever know."
"""When left to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the era of hunting and gathering,"" he wrote."
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced the anger of the people.
In May, he had voted in favour of rejecting the cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and had restored the nearly 532,000 shillings per month, tax-free bodybuilders' wages, which are considered to be among the highest in the world.
The birth day of Mukesh Ambani's wife, the richest Indian in the world, is just one November, but as soon as the clocks on the night of October 30 struck twelve o'clock, the entire Jodhpur Nita Ambani's birthday began to ring.
Earlier, the atmosphere of the celebration was completely created by the performance of the AR Rahman team.
At 8:00 p.m. on this musical night, Rahman presented his signatures.
Priyanka Chopra was on the stage to dissolve the beautiful colours of the dance.
Nearly 32 charters arrived in Jodhpur for guests attending the Birth Day of Nita Ambani.
Due to reduced parking space at Jodhpur airport, charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars including BMW L and Jugar were requested.
Sood said the city's cleanliness, street lights have completely failed.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and Hooda to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He has demanded that Panchkula be completely dismantled.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said that after the municipal corporation elections, the city has got new MPs and mayors, but they do not have the power to do the work.
As a result, the city councillors have become a dummy and the officials are working on their own.
Sood said the Municipal Corporation has millions of rupees, but all the money is being recovered by depositing FDs in banks.
But no steps are being taken to invest money in the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of doping ground is the most serious.
Due to the creation of doping ground in Sector 23, people living in Ghaggar cross-sectors have been forced to live narcissistic lives for the past several years.
Municipal Corporation officials have been talking about shifting the doping ground in the village of Zhuriwala for the past several years, but people in the Barwala area are already suffering from a serious problem of flies.
Health services and education systems in the villages have deteriorated utterly, he said.
To date, no work has been undertaken to provide facilities to people in rural areas.
The U.N. sets new targets for tackling poverty
The United Nations will immediately begin work on the new set of goals, which will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
To replace the M.D.D. ending in 2015, the Australian diplomat played an important role in advancing the "Sustainable Development Goals" just before the overnight Transportation Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Gilgard during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night's summit that it was time to "raise above national interests."
"I am delighted that the member countries have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process to establish the universal transportable development goal,"" he said."
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my best to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to meet our far-reaching objectives of the transportable development goals based on the success of the MDG.
Mozambique's Security Concerns Rise as Powerful Persons Clash
With a statue of Mozambique's founder President Samora staring down at them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo for the slogan of peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of an investment company.
Fearing about his country's future, he changed his corporate outfit from a "We Demand Security" print t-shirt in Portuguese and he joined the crowds of the capital's Freedom Square on Thursday.
The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo has been reported almost daily for two weeks, more than 20 years after a peace deal.
Ray Namo was initially a notorious rebel of the white-ruled Rhodesia and the dissident South African government-backed movement as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely to return to the country's full developed conflict, but recent events have discouraged foreign investors and local people.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy of the West's vast offshore gas reserves and the discovery of coal reserves, some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Eni could bring in investments of more than $50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the main political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tension.
On October 17, the government launched the latest clash by launching an attack on its members in Sofa La Province, a traditional one of the Rae Namo Fortress.
Former insurgents were attacked and then increased by government forces at Renmo sites and told the Financial Times that the group's leader, Fernando Mashang, tried to kill the spokesman for Renmo.
The government has accused Ray Namo of attacking the soldiers and blamed the clash for the trigger.
President Armando Jebujan has called for disregarding concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibuzhan told AFP, the French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "loser" "whatever his armies continue to try to prove that he can enforce his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Mazhang was quoted as saying that the 1992 peace agreement was cancelled but later became a matter of concern.
He told FT that the agreement is not being honored by Free Limo
Our vision is to come back for the compromise negotiation, but seriously," Mr. Mashangne said.
Last talks between the two sides did nothing special to alleviate the strain of a series of conflicts this year.
"This is about two great men (Jibuzhan and Dhakama) fighting together," said Joseph Han, a lecturer and Mozambican expert at the Open University of London.
Neither of them are good negotiators, nor are they required to make any kind of concessions.
Ray Namo, who is pushing for election reforms, had already called for the exclusion of the municipal corporation elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force from the government as an effort of a patient movement to win concessions and economic looting.
Ray Namo's share in the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, a former Ray Namo member, is expected to improve its performance in the elections, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM).
Mr. Mazhang says Mr. Jebuzhanko - who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to quit the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Mr Mazhang said.
What kind of capability is Ray Namo's has not been clarified, but it has made visits of disturbing hits and runs on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the sofas of the clashes are located in the province of Meiji, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, with the host port of Bira relying on miners, coal exports including Rio Tinto and the valley.
In June, after threatening to attack the Rey Namo line, the railway suspended its operation for nearly a week.
When asked whether or not Ray Namo would be able to duplicate this danger, Mr. Mazhangvineet was almost there.
"Things were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to alert the international community," said Mr. Mazhang.
The government of instability has further exacerbated the delusions, says Fernando Lima, media cop, who is the head of an independent media company, many are also concerned about the recent flood of corruption, slow growth and kidnappings.
"People are the people responsible for the country's future, the government and the president, and they think he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar Sultanat, an exhibitor, people still need sustainability.
"No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught "as a model for a way of life's author",myths and legends.
Thor's stories could show "there is no match for all the subtle moves in the crude force," while the importance of having a dream in the Eonurian legends reveals.
Even to teach many of the myths would not be appropriate to teach it even in the wild and in some cases even in porn and schools, "Cross Lee Holland advocated one of the age-appropriate actions of "cautious selection."
"I find it surprising, in the United States, myth and folk music are already a part of the field of education," he said.
I've been practicing this as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers "more enthralling" and it's "a new twist" for children, along with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon along with writing a penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said: "Your intentions can be many but it will be better to keep it out of sight."
Probably for a offspring, an adult writer's writing and an adult writer's writing require some meanings of the big difference of hope between an adult.
Everything has to come to a simplified or a happy ending, because it is an intuition of good and evil.
And that said should be submitted, rather revealed through a story than said.
The old base is not showing.

Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People may argue that New York City is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: about a century ago, humorous playwright Frank Fae, who served as the master of the function at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, introduced people sitting in the crowd to the way of direct conversation.
The discovery of Fae has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Designed and operated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Standup Institute called Carolines, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners appeared in Carolinas, and became very successful, to the point where they became too big to be played at the club," says Hirsch.
We built this celebration as a way to continue to work with them.
This year's event includes the presence of Vanda Sizes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, including "Stand Up for Heroes" featuring Bruce Springsteen, Bruce Springsteen, John
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional media, such as Comedy Central, FX, and small shows coming on networks like Spike.
Nick Krol, a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's eagerly-awaited Ronnie Fantasy-Football theme "The League") has reached the top spot, and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Satterday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marsel the Shell With Shoes On."
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crawl and Slate, are the products of the decentralized world of American comedy by Anthony Jesselnick, who is completely disillusioned with the sounds of different, eccentric, ethnicity-focused W. Kamau Bell.
One of the main attractions of the festival will be an interview: Speaking to Larry David of David Steinberg:
Steinberg had started working as a stand-up comedian, but he has become a prominent television and film director, as well as an illegitimate comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy With David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will be held at the City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
Steinberg said, "The city is certainly in the comedy DNA of all Larry's works."
They were telling me that, when they are here, sometimes they go down the street between two buildings and think to themselves that if I ever lose all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall to $96 per barrel.
A report showing a worrying offset of higher supplies like Friday's downward trend towards oil prices is where China's power-hungry construction sector is gaining strength.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents on the US crude New York Mercantile Exchange in electronic trading in Europe by late morning at $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell 5.8 per cent for the month of October, down 39 cents on Thursday.
The supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supply grew by 4.1 million barrels last week.
For more than five weeks, supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand in activity has revealed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing have come out on Friday.
This suggests that Kiwi growth could continue to strengthen China's economic reform after falling by 7.8 per cent in the previous quarter from one to two decades in the third quarter.
Brent Crude also fell from $108.58 per barrel to 26 cents on the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refiners.
The court has blocked action on the New York Police Department's suspension and sports policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case, requiring an order from a judge for the New York Police Department's pause and sports program.
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 2nd Judge Shira Schindler has said the judges will pend the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in Nagar had pronounced a verdict in August on violation of the Constitution in order to prevent people and exclude them from their program of interrogation.
The City Police Department has also appealed the decision to allocate a surveillance to assist in its policy and related training program change, its findings and its curative order.
The appellate court heard the pleadings on the request travel on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal has stated that because he should have compromised the requirement for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in a series of media interviews and deviated from the Code of Conduct for US Judges by the public, he should have done wrong deeds in the case of Aadhaar.
The judge had ruled that police officers had wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pause and sports program.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes in policies, training and supervision, including major reforms, and has ordered a pilot program for testing body-wearing cameras in certain campuses where she closes most.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police arrest.
An oral argument on the appeal of Nagar is scheduled for some time after 14th March 2014.
The pause and sporting device has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
Pausing and sports policy has been around for decades in some form, but from mostly black and Hispanic men, 684330 to an all-time high in 2011 have been recorded to prevent growth dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg.
One lawsuit was filed by four men from all minorities in 2004 and became the case of a class action.
Proponents of the NYPD's pause and change in the sports program have said that the unreasonable behavior will end by forming a more reliable and effective police force and may affect the use of other police department policies.
Opponents say the change will reduce the mood of the police, but it will solve a widespread problem of a police force under pressure after the shrinkage by thousands of officers over the past decade, crime, money wasted and not.
The judge has noted that the pause and termination for the sport had not been placed, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD's stop.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamsheedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribag and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all participants were briefed on various sciences including tent pitching, flag pole.
The training obligation is being fulfilled with the cooperation of Dr Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are spreading a sense of unity by joining in prayer.
Camp chief Vipin Kumar is providing special assistance to the State Training Commissioner.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm classified information. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Former editor of News of the World, Andy Colson, has been accused of attempting to confirm a so-called secret information about his relationship while he was Charles Clarke's secretary-at-home.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Paulby.
The court said the newspaper had hired private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Paulby's voicemail and "keep an eye on" the man, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Addis said that "the suggestion of the implementation side is that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of the N.O.T.W., is not known to stand outside people's homes and watch them, but to keep articles in front of people, to see what people react to it."
He said the N.O.T.W. used three methods to investigate the cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third one included the editor himself.
Of course, he knew the other way, that is to say, he certainly knew.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says, no, we have to say, "Yes, he knew exactly."
Rumors about Clark's love affairs were first introduced by A.O.T.W.'s Feature Desk at the time, when a sexually aroused source at Ms. Paulby said: "Don't waste your time, he's with Charles."
In August 2006, from Mulcair's home, a tape of Ms. Paulby's phone was seized at least three times.
The investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer on which Ms. Paulby and her sister were named "Project".
During the period in which he was being investigated, information was sought about him by calling anonymously to the grandfather of Ms. Paulby.
Former chief reporter Neville Thurlebek and former reporter James Vaderup watched the arrival and departure of Ms. Paulby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him via a voicemail: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I would definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Addis said Colson's involvement in the case is in the same parton as other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blanchett.
The court heard on Thursday that, Colson had been talking to Mr. Blanchett about marital relations with a married woman, while at the time he was looking at the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to interact with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Thurlebeck and Vederup have accepted phone hacking.

On the instructions of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of the US post, which is located less than 5 km away from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media asked the BfV to express hope to identify the presence of the leasing antenna and indicated an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, stressed that the U.S. did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and increase or lower the international competitiveness of U.S. companies." Then in September, it was used to "steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and increase or lower the international competitiveness of U.S. companies."
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made whistleblowers, began telling American surveillance of his secret treasures, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director will keep his promises.
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) spied on Brazil's Petrobras oil company and our cloud providers Google and Yahoo and Yahoo expressed fears about the government's surveillance.
The last thing that came to light was when it was discovered that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be targeted, then certainly the leaders of the business world are also targeting potential targets.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible for these data to be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German small and medium-sized IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the German Companies Council, the U.S. has almost now become a major risk like China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
All the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, however, there is still no evidence that the US has known the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed disregard for the European Union's lack of internet capabilities. And it should try to reduce its reliance on the US.
The leaders of the business world are doubting this.
Someone in the German parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Hasso Platoner, president of the German business software company SAP, said: "This is no way.
If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then he should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is discounted in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations exposed by Snowden about U.S. technical sophistication and espionage access have proven to be a trauma for some companies whose biggest surveillance threat was previously believed to be China.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing field where European officials are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, some 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure about the data prism mining program.
“We saw a new question that customers didn’t come up with a year ago – that is – is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?” says Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP.
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and therefore should be guarded at all costs.
That there is an economic spy is not surprising.
It has always happened.
"This has been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do so, because it is in the national interest to protect our business.
Corporate leaders are generally unwilling about the defense system and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, it’s unwise to leave a message in the home business, whether it’s unwise to leave a laptop in a hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of car manufacturer Audi, says that this is a year-old system for collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they can't be used as remote hearing aids.
Germany's BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when the smartphone is compromised due to risks on overseas tours.
The prepaid mobile phone was later discarded.
However, small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, many companies are at the forefront of the global market in particular place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrecy against unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The U.S. has warned of the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to the France The Washington Post, in February, the name of the U.S. national intelligence behind China, along with Russia and Israel, was named in a second tier of the criminals involved in the hacking.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: "Services know well that all countries, even if they join in non-terrorist combat, spy on their allies."
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do so, because it is in the national interest to protect our business.
No one is making a fool.
The parents of Georgia's teenage son who was killed in a "unique accident" believe that his son was killed
A Georgia teenager whose dead body was found wrapped in a wrestling mat in his high school gym believes his son was murdered, family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson was found trapped in a mat directly behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on Jan. 11 in Valdosta, GA.
Investigators at the London County Sheriff's Office found that Johnson died in a "unique accident," but the 17-year-old's family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Crump, presenting Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News Dotcom that "he fully believes that his son has been murdered."
He does not trust the sheriff's death in the way he was told.
"He believes that this is beyond the rationale of physical rule and common sense,"" Krump said."
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person responsible for their son's death or the safety of the people.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag."
U.S. Attorney General Michael Muller said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, given that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Murray made the remarks at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, they will take us wherever we go.
My goal is to bring out the truth.
"I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation,"" he said."
Murray told reporters that the anambic body tests found signs that Johnson's death was a result of "local respiratory arrest."
According to Murray, by the way, a different cause of death was found in a second body test."
"There are a lot of questions that should be answered or confirmed,"" he said."
Murray also said that if he finds enough evidence to summon a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or to investigate civil rights, he would ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the office of the Landes County Sheriff.
On Wednesday, a South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some indications of how he died.
The CDC has issued guidelines on allergies of children for schools.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for controlling food allergies of children in the school.
Such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government for the first time, as the number of children suffering from food allergies going to school is increasing.
One in every 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, there was an 18 per cent increase in cases of food allergies in children.
This guideline provides information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies, and how to handle them in the event of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been advised to keep stock of apinephrine to cope with potentially deadly anaphylaxis - which is the auto-injector of the apine brand that is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily keep stocks of more apneaphrine.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms to be transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children may say, "It feels like something is biting in my tongue," "It feels like my tongue has hair," or "My tongue is getting tingling."
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Choose Their Children’s ‘Gender Indeterminate’
Germany has become the first country of the European Union to recognise the third sex for children born with confusing genitals.
Newborns will no longer be specified as male or female in a systematic way.
According to the new law, parents are not required to declare gender for such children, the law allows them to declare gender ‘unspecified’ or ‘unspecified’ on the child’s birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce the pressure on parents who can make gender-specific decisions related to surgical treatment for newborns in a hurry, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex man had said years later, "Not I'm a man, not a woman."
I will continue to be a wounded, damaging pawn made by doctors.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year has a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the scrutiny of sexual development disorders, this is the collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovaries or ovaries), or abnormally developed sex.
It is possible that Valis Simpson was having intercourse.
Gender identity is still not understood correctly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best available information to specify gender when gender-determination may not be possible and to develop and perform surgical-therapeutic procedures, if such a novice comes to mind, before the child.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who is an expert on gender-identity issues, said Germany's new law "seems to be a good thing."
Intersex children create moral inconsistencies.
"Some people are in a life-crisis-like situation that requires surgery, but most children don't."
You can specify the gender without surgery, and then see how the identities develop afterwards.
The science of knowing how a sex will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a reasonable answer about why this happens.
It's kind of a puzzle as to why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people are described as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to gender, but is either apparently related to the form of the ego or to its biological composition rather than to the form of the ego, which is neither explicitly masculine nor feminine.
These characteristics may exhibit secondary sexual characteristics themselves, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of employment, as well as about harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-compliant genders.
Australia and Nepal have already given adults permission to mark men, women or the "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nori May-Valby became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to maintain "unspecified" sex status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passport will also have a third specification as X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, gender-related issues in neighbouring countries are still controversial in France.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition to take back "gender theory" from school books.
U.S. website Catholic Online has also objected to Germany's law saying, "While the world is going into a state where gender is a self-chosen option, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction."
The mother of the newborn baby in Maryland also told Baby Jones that she would like to see the babies be gendered at birth.
On the website, he said, "Praise itself is very stressful without additional limitations, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites (bisexuals), who were named after the beautiful Greek god who was bilingual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world thought of penis as a slate that could be erased and rewritten.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgical treatment, they are understanding that gender identification is a complex task, and sometimes even doctors can make a mistake, who do not know what children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
Drescher says "in the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a "maniac emergency."
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
Existing theory about the treatment of children with vague genitals was presented by John Hapkins University Dr. John Money, who considered the sex to be constructive.
He formulated the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues—how parents raise a child—determine whether a child is identified as male or female by interacting with the child's genes and hormones.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", their theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex had been accidentally sexualized during a lingering ulceration (circumcision) to remove the child's ovaries and make him look like a red-haired girl.
Drasher said, "Money presented the case as a successful case of stagnation, but that did not happen."
At the age of 15, the child changed himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are still "following that pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the later years of the year 1990, these individuals undergoing sex surgery began to emerge "not happy with the result."
A similar case was with 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce of Montana, who was born with an XY male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
Physicians clearly did not understand that his penis was short, or his genitals were large, but they were sure that he could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
So some time after she was born in 1976, Bruce's outer organs and testicles were removed by surgery and she was treated like an adult girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was hard to ask.
At the age of 18, she was going to have a vasectomy.
But depressed and feeling somewhat upset, he demanded medical records.
This led him to find out the terrible truth.
When I was born I was poisoned - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented his body from making enough testosterone due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, took testosterone supplements and removed his breasts.
He became infertile due to surgery.
Today, he explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to normalize their perception.
But, the California-based legal group Advocates for Information Choice's executive director, Anne Tamer-Mattis, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites shyness and disgrace."
"Many activists believe that German law will prompt parents to make swift decisions and define the child as 'undecided'," she says.
We are afraid that this will encourage interference.
We think that it is a better process to specify the gender of a man or a woman than to wait.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Mattis said his organization supports Australian law because it "allows adults to be identified in the third sex."
"About the legal sex, adults should be able to make their own decisions,"" he said."
German law is concerned with specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a fight to be fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist Dr. Arlene Baratz, whose daughter has a sexual developmental disorder, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law would "give power to both parents and children."
Baratzi's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a D.D. called full androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since her androgen grade was defective, female characteristics developed in the cat.
He has a vagina in his body, but no uterus or oesophagus.
Katy, 29, is now married and a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents not to make decisions on their own in a hurry."
It provides them with time to understand and properly write ‘male’ or ‘female’ by some tests before writing.
This way, you stay okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely baby and have fun with it.
We don't need to do surgery in a hurry that can't be returned.
"It brings children into the decision-making process and frees them from the ambiguity that inspires parents because they don't believe they are recovering,"" he said."
Eventually, the child will determine which sex he is more comfortable with -- and that would be a very good thing.
It allows children to make decisions for themselves.
The Legal Awareness Camp was held at the Ramnagar Middle School Dalheer, Ramnagar, under the chairmanship of the Committee and the chairman of the Tehsil Legal Services Committee, Sandeep Kaur.
In which students and others were informed of the law for the right to education and the economically disadvantaged.
At the camp, lawyers ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj, and Sarpanch informed the people on the matter.
A large number of villagers were present at the event.
Report: Biden's Dumping Obama Campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton in place of Biden for the 2012 ticket.
The most notable blast in the revelation is the highly anticipated 2012 campaign by Mark Alperin and John Helmann, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and said Thursday evening that the president's top advisers could help with Obama's re-election hopes of finding out what dumping bidden could help.
According to the Times National Political Reporter Jonathan Martin, the book gives full information of the efforts made in the campaign of the chief officers and the White House, the head of the former White House staff bill for the name, to find out what the former Secretary of State is what the vice president of Clinton has changed.
The potential switch was a very secure secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago Campaign and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s close advisers – including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and former White House senior advisers David Axlrod and David Paluffe – were known to be under consideration.
The "double down" claims Dale tried to change Biden despite his personal alignment eventually before deciding when his information was telling him that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I said looking at the whole scene, and one of them, it was," Dale told the newspaper.
You remember, at that time the presidency was in danger, so we were in such a position, "Holy Christ, what more shall we do?"
While Dale called the research a "caution," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign had again made a significant investment in finding out how much dividend this claim would give if polled.
"Campaigns like Money don't spend on polling and focused groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It is unclear, halaki, what Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dole if his boss was aware of the potential change.
While Dale said he didn't think the president was aware of the potential change, the former chief of staff considered it "possible" that it was known to Obama.
"Double Down" sure: Will not answer whether political inquiry reached Obama's desk? Martin said more.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought he was unaware of Obama Biden's dumping ticket research.
"Maybe," Martin said.
Do you like glo-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first glo-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the marine animal to develop the best breakfasts.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to use chemical glow to re-polish the protein.
Ice cream, eaters who react with the tongue will increase the pH level of the protein and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says the ice cream is glowing with the heat of the mouth reacting, i.e. the more you lick the win, the more it will glow.
"It's an incredible thing, but the early days production will get me from <0xC2><0xA3>200 to about 2 grams of stuff," said Charlie, founder of the IMC Delicious Ice Cream Company.
The proteins we use in ice creams will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth warms, the protein pH level will increase and the ice cream will glow.
We've been testing for the last few months and it looks perfect to share on Halloween because it gives amazing glow effect.
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I've made since jellyfish glow is four times more expensive than gold
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
However, the taste is very good.
Apnea is famous for its unusual taste, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf, an experimental company based in Bristol.
But his next creation is going to be even more ambitious, he said.
"I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream," he said.
It's naturally impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the repression above the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of the reflective properties of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The whole market was in a hurry from customers in the Rani Bagh market.
Recently, people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy the pot.
It was recently held in Vajirpur, Advantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Prashant Vihar Central Market.
Some similar sightings were also seen at the surf shops of Patampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
Here, too, people bought gold and silver jewelry and coins.
Due to this, there has also been congestion in other markets, including the outer ring road.
However, people who left the office for home had to spend hours in jam to get home.
Halloween 2013: by Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play to play for the dress up neighborhood.
Nowadays, I've become more of a greedy
I haven't even signed in to give out candy from my apartment for the last two years and probably won't this year.
But the statistics show that there is a black sheep when Halloween comes in.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating $158 million this time around, spending $6.9 billion on candy and costumes and decorations.
One of the things I've always seen in my life is the beauty of Halloween.
According to the NRF, the total cost of clothing is estimated at $6.9 billion.
This year, everyone is angry at the inanimate objects.
Women don't have to eat veggies because they're sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
Many zombies are hopeful for Murdo, and thanks to Murdo's space turmoil, our Instagram feeds for men will be created this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after outfits will be zombies, Batman, robbers and thieves.
I think there is nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dog and surprisingly we were not alone.
According to NRF, Americans will literally spend $330 million on pet costumes.
That's why there are so many doggies with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to the Nielsen company, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Hayrish Bars, Lollipops, Milk Duds, Twins and Clark Bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it's good news that 41 million tricks are taking place in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we, and the ones who are joking, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we will not use during Halloween is candycorn, but it will also sell around 35 million pounds.
That's about 9 billion of the maize's personal gluttony.
This is a mystery. To solve yet
There's nothing more important than the halloween ghost house.
They have the best name, "terror behind the wall (which,in fact, is a prison), "scream-o-scream" and were like "House of Shock."
In fact, according to the U.S. government, there are 1,200 officially-approved ghost houses in the U.S. that generate 500 million revenues. And that terrible good picture that your friend puts on Facebook and that guy that likes you and doesn't comment on you.
In the end, let's talk about cucumbers.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
By chance, for us, the "Baby in a Pumpkin Trend" was the legacy of Pintarest, which began last year, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not staying with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. will spend around $106 million on pumpkin this year.
A jack-o-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
If you're looking for extra debt, try engraving the phone Tim and Susan's quotes in Napa, Calif., and above their 2,032 pound pumpkin.
"""It was decided to issue a postcard with a photo of Sachin during the pre-match presentation prior to the start of the match,"" the MCA said in a statement."

In addition, a special coin will be used for the toss, which will be held by the MCA.
The MCA will also release a 64-page leaflet, which will include articles related to Tendulkar and statements from business, sports and journalists.
The limited-numbered leaflet and coins will be distributed to MCA and BCCI members.
He said that 10,000 masks, 10,000 scorecards and 10,000 caps will be distributed each day with photos of Sachin.

The dream of the traders to do business in the Patakha market in the Transport Area did not come true.
Patakha merchants have been trapped in Mazdar after the order of the High Court.
Neither can they now do business in the temporary Patakha market made at Ranjit Avenue nor have they been issued licenses for business in the Transport Area.
A commission formed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during its visit declared the temporary Patakha market on Ranjit Avenue unsafe.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar was also fined Rs 10 lakh due to lack of proper management there.
The High Court, in its order, has strongly condemned the administrative authorities of Amritsar for the work of which the administration has not been able to solve even one of the difficulties of the tyrannical traders for nine years.
They could not be found in the city.
Thereafter, proper security management tax was asked to issue licenses for business only in the Jajgarh-based market.
Even after the order, the shopkeepers were happy, but on their happiness, the police returned water on Friday.
The actual licensing team of the police branch reached the Patakha market and set up counters there and sold the farm.
It was impossible to fulfill the conditions that were given to them afterwards in one day.
Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma Patakha, ACP East Gaurav Garg, is currently in charge of the licensing branch.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the managements made by the Patakha traders.
Therefore, the licenses were not issued to the Patakha merchants.
Diwali has one day left.
Due to this, the retailers are troubled.
They are facing a loss of Rs 1 crore.
Patakha trader Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni said they would sue the district administration if they lost Rs 1 crore.
Angry Patakha traders marched from Jahazgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
The police and the district administration were protesting.
Thereafter, the business was also closed in the temporary Patakha market running at Ranjit Avenue.
A fire brigade was called to rescue a missing pope at the mouth of a distressing mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby fled after coming into a small road collision
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker stranded in the mine.
Firefighters lowered the front of the rock from the rope to save the dog from the mouth of death
After being somehow trapped at the tip of a distressing mountain 50 feet above the ground by P.P., he got a happy life after being summoned to firefighters.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby had fled after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, Denham, Ruby, were in the flappite mine at Pashmichy Yorkshire to meet again, and he has thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After a small accident, after he escaped, he had searched like a madman for his lost dog, and appeals were posted on social networking sites.
On Wednesday at 2.15 p.m., a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby on the mountain in the mine at an altitude of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station reached the scene and took Ruby down by rope to rescue him and used a stomach tube to bring him down from the rock.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: "He was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet up and down.
He did not take any action during the rescue, he remained the stone.
But now he is good.
Then she ate the biscuits.
It was a call for an extraordinary help.
It's unbelievable to see a dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has survived fortunately."
He was likely to be seriously injured or even in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where he was found to be good in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
Ms Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work."
I had no idea how he got there.
It's amazing to get him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if she gets too tired and falls, she would definitely fall down.
The firefighters did a very good job.
What he has done is a very courageous work.
We are proud of them, and they were all the best.
Mr. Elderson also said of Kigley: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The firefighters did a great job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says when Katy Perry was 18, she didn't beat him
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, Pon Starr said he sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."

He said, "This thing got old, and he treats me well."
The 70-year-old Jagger's representative said in a statement Thursday that he "clearly denies about ever hitting Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Perry is probably talking about him in the misunderstanding of another person."

George Kerrvan: The dissolution of the Euro has given the Scottish
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that a free Scotland will be required to join as a free travel area throughout Europe as a condition of EU membership.
Passport control on the barewire and the tangled wire on the walls of Hadrian indicate stories about the boundary of the wire.
The truth is that the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although – predictably – it did not describe it in the headlines.
Neither did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as per their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen area, Brussels will have an affordable discount for non-compliance Brussels in return for getting what it really wants from Scotland.
Therefore, again, non-history.
And the thing that’s been stuck for so long, it’s frozen. First I heard the “freedom means passport control” unfounded news about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should you expect to bid on Europe from independent Scotland anyway?
Why buy and sell London's yoke for Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Dedicated teams across the EU are gaining strength to oppose the EU or to close the euro as an equivalent currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - which was founded this year - suddenly came and received nearly fifty million votes in the September federal election, and thus made the equivalent of the free Democrats (our influential Lib Dems).
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be a major change.
As well as the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, due to the barriers imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency, many people have to think that the project Europe has gone a long way.
Excessive budget deficits of national governments did not play much role in the euro crisis - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized its members' currency exchange rates in favour of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a domestic currency depreciation, southern Europe finds itself in a position of inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public spending - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Deeper European productivity suffers far beyond the current budget and currency problems.
To provide discounts to French and German energy firms at the expense of consumers - as a result of the "harsh" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
This is the cost-bending loss that we people have already seen in the Grandmaugh.
Even if all wages in the world are frozen, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be saved from being impacted by affordable U.S. shell gas.
As a result, there has been a sense of rebellion among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, France's top politicians saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany, and Paris as a means of providing Washington with the same billing in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, causing France's economy to collapse.
Result: Marine Lee Pen's far-right, anti-EU National Front has won by pushing the ruling socialist into third place in the recent by-elections.
The front is the most popular party in France at the moment with 24 percent of the vote - this is a timely warning to the British Labour that they can't go on assuming that disintegration for the left, would automatically benefit the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his newfound fame in the middle of the French white working class?
The party wants to make use of the next year's EU elections to form an anti-EU, all-powerful anti-currency group in the European Parliament.
If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, such a group could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: Soon the union of anti-EU and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will end the euro.
The euro will not be completely over, but it will reappear in a form such as the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that will be backed by General Di Gaulle.
Germany and some of its more prosperous economies may maintain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the U.K. to keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing closer ties with the U.S.
However, the growing interest of Wansington in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland in the aftermath?
We can choose to stay in the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better work-outs in a loose European system, as long as we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-federal nations to work together with other countries with similar thinking in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic freedom while on the road to Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - notably - has been the most successful anti-consumerist political campaign in Europe, opposing the (so-implemented) Bhagavad-g<0xC4><0xAB>t<0xC4><0x81> cuts in 2011 and afterwards proposed by Labour Chancellor Elistair Darling on the basis of (so-implemented) Bhagavad-g<0xC4><0xAB>t<0xC4><0x81>
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as in that case it would have to accept the rules of mitigation imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Childhood: Growing up early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls achieve adolescence at a younger age than blonde girls of their own age.
Physical change does not mean that the youth is close.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals can be blamed.
Experts believe that obesity flare-ups can be a cause of adolescence at a young age
Premature adolescence is not as effective in boys
Former CNN journalist Pat etheriz is an expert in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter begins to develop breasts and produce hair from the genitals at the age of 7 or 8?
This week at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz clarified that these are the initial physical changes that go on in American girls, the new thing is common.
Kaplowitz says, "I spend a lot of time giving parents this confidence - that it doesn't usually reflect rapid progress towards full adolescence."
Direct signs of development such as germination of breasts, hair and body odors of the genitals and elbows are seen early in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of rhodosharsan (first menstrual-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years in the first rhetoric," explains Kaplovitz, who is also the author of "Time-pre-adolescence in girls: the necessary guides to deal with this common problem."
The most accurate test of youth development is time.
There is debate about what the onset of adolescence is, but when breast growth increases before the age of 8 years, the two call it "child-adult."
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop - which the pediatrician can inspect closely.
In the event of more rapid progress, an examination by an endocrinologist may be necessary to eliminate the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments for delaying premenstrual periods and other consequences: premenstrual ageing of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and nata as adults.
Drugs or hormones for treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Cappellovitz is aware of drugs but admits, "Suppressing young people can increase behavioral issues, and girls can start to feel different from their peers."
The second big problem can be understood: parents just don’t want their younger daughter to have menstruation.
"They worry about the risk of conceiving, or how they will maintain hygiene," Kaplovitz said.
A woman, whose daughter began menstruation at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this and we had also talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was frightened of her school and returned annoyed that she had started menstruation among her classmates.
There are many up-to-date theories about the causes of asexual youth.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media can be blamed.
Boys, like girls, are also getting premature adolescence.
The Capellovitz rules that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
She helped conduct the study on girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001, which combines body fat with adolescence.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it as well.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get puberty before their age.
There are many explanations for this.
At the global level, the model of pre-teen years, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be influenced by all things.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at a young age, but the behavior of fully adolescence in them is as unclear as in girls.
Other physicians attending the A.A.P. conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see mumps and genital hair.
The pediatrician and endocrinologist at the Goreybe Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, Dr. Lawrence Silverman says, "We need to be careful about what we do when we're really young."
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician on how to talk to their children.
Kaplovitz advised, "It may mean negotiating in advance of the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond correctly.
Premature girls need to be assured that even if it is premature, it is part of normal life.
The temperature fell by 3.1 degrees Celsius on Friday.
The rain and cold weather on Wednesday night caused people to feel very cold.
On Friday, people wore sweaters and went to the markets and their destination.
When the first winter rains came, people also took out the rainbow.
In the morning, people were enjoying the sunshine.
As the weather changes, there will also be a lot of relief from the disease, but after that, the sunshade continued to flow with clouds throughout the day.
The children also went to school wearing sweaters.
According to the Air Force Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
While 7.8 mm of rain was recorded.
According to the weather department, clouds will remain in the sky.
Large orders of jet manufacturers bet from controversy to seat width.
This month's Dubai Arsenal has seen a tide between the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
The controversy focuses on the width of the economy-class seats on long-haul aircraft, not as always as provided by airlines but whose allotted space efficiency has been claimed by Latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company to be key.
Airbus is expecting such an industry standard to give at least 18-inch (46 cm) wide seats in the economy cabin this week, but it should be decided by airlines, its main rival Boeing said.
The controversy arises between aircraft makers when a large version of the twin engines of the long-haul aircraft began to be sold from the possible order entered after the incident of 17-21.
How has the previous department of the aircraft been built--especially whether the seating is 9 or 10 is equal to the claim of greater capacity, while designs of mini jumbo jets are being developed?
Boeing says it has built a "777 X" that will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in the unicorn department.
Airbus said it would take 350 people on board with the A350 in an equivalent of 9 seats left 18 inches away.
Airplane giants often strike business on technical issues through advertising in the business press.
Now, with the Airbus 777 X, it is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Arsenal, appealing to the public further.
Recently, it has been seen that whatever the beginning of the Civil War has been, will you accept this, showing Fincero three together in a restaurant together?
Airbus chief sales officer John Lehi said "Boeing is also offering long-haul flights in combination with regional turbochargers."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way the plane sits hasn't changed.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 Jumbo did not define modern long-term ki travel as tha, and the average 40-49-year-old U.S. male ke weight increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average male waistline in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a 1950s seat concept when the new name "Jet Set" had an average perimeter string.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission that suggests an additional inch in the width of the seat to improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputed Airbus' seat measurement figures, saying it was not up to the manufacturers to decide how the airline strikes a balance between charter and facilities.
It also says, research shows that more than a seat width depends on the experience of the cabin.
Kent Crowwer, a Boeing cabin expert, said: "It really explains what it takes to give airlines flexibility and what they believe they need to do to be successful."
"They don't want to tell us what benefits they have."
They know their business better than anyone else.
It's about the elbow room for flyers, but for suppliers it's increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
The controversy has led to a trade of at least $700 billion, which is estimated to be enough in the coming decades to tip the scale of U.S. and European exports.
For the first time in July, Reuters reported that whether the seat layout is really a matter of battle between new jet planes.
Airbus and Boeing claimed a 20 per cent workflow per seat in their new twin-engine design led by that segment, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Air.
Boeing's performance claim depends on the design of the 777 X One 10 compared to the 777 original 9.
A comparison of 10 with profit in unit cost has now been used.
Kevin Keniston, head of Europe's Airbus Passenger Facility, says "Boeing is doing this to make their aircraft more competitive with our products, to occupy more seats."
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-line cabin suggests for the existing 777 S that many passengers are in favour of a denser layout, which can also go with cheap rentals..
Cabin Interior Expert My Karbi, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network, said: "Eighteen-inch seat width will be great for passengers, but the reality is that this Airbus business point is driven by the threat of the 777."
Airbus and Boeing are not supplying seats but are providing a list of suppliers to choose from for airlines.
Jet vendors around the world should also take precautions to check on this layouts competition.
While more relaxing, all builders are also providing low-cost jet aircraft services and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is delivering a 10-equivalent A350 but says it hasn't sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus focused on the wider cabin seats on some of its jet planes for the need for more cabin facilities.
It is not likely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers of modern jet aircraft, but it could distract from the 777 X sales wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may end the enjoyment of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can end the fun encountered by smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine, the rats were able to keep nicotine addiction safe for life.
Further testing on humans is needed before it starts, which can take many years, but Professor Ronald Crystal, of Will Cornell Medical College in New York, said the clinical signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy may ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking more often than not using all the methods available in the market today, but he found that
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which is designed to deliver genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to make a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevent the rise of nicotine deposits inside the smoker by making them ineffective before they reach the brain.
In the test, rats given vaccines that were later given nicotine continued their normal activity.
The researchers say that but the rat who wasn't given the vaccine felt "good", it was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a journal called Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they contained antibodies.
It had to be dosed at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as it will make the liver cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before attempting to cigarettes, thus saving them from nicotine addiction.
But it is likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help relieve their habits," he said.
British scientists called the result interesting, but warned of the need for too much research to be done.
Even after the postmortem, the veil could not be lifted due to the actual death of Baghin.
The Department of Forestry is at first glance saying that the death of Baghin is natural.
On Thursday night, the Ramnagar Forest Division forest staff found the body of a tadpole near the Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichri Nale.
With all the organs of the body of Baghin safe, there were no wounds or injuries, etc.
Veterinary surgeon Bharat of CTR, veterinary surgeon Hema Rathore of Kotabag, veterinary surgeon Kai Bharat of CTR, veterinary surgeon Kai Bharat of DFO Kakasha Nasim, veterinary surgeon Kai Bharat of SDO GS Karki, veterinary surgeon Kai Bharat of Kotabag
According to sources, the internal organs of the tiger are reported to have deteriorated during the postmortem.
It did not reveal the true cause of the death of the Tiger.
Departmental officials were responding to Baghin's death.
However, the internal organs of the bladder have been sent to the IVRI Bareilly for topsychologic examination to confirm the poisoning.
Wildlife conservationist Western Circle Vivek Pandey said that the death of the tiger can only be said to be natural.
No signs of poisoning, etc. have been found from the body of Baghin.
However, a probe has been sent to the surrounding area to confirm the poison as well as to search for it.
Tripods deny us being influenced by Obi-Wan.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripod will be examined by State Corpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has denied sea leases that denial of the policy at the request of his political guru Eddie Obide, former New South Wales patron Eddie Obide, whose government-controlled land was hidden in three lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) detailed the investigation on Friday that,What did Mr. Obide do to many State Ministers for violating the circulars of the leases of footwear policy? Where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obide are located in Agatha in 2005.
After the evidence given on Thursday by Lynn Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff, this accused Mr. Tripodi knew the hidden interest of Mr. Obide? is now under investigation.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had put pressure to launch a public tender for leases.
The tenants were against it and they wanted more time.
Circular Enterprises for leases in 2009, which Obid earned $2.5 crore annually, were renewed from tenders without leases.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change at the request of Mr. Obid, Mr. Tripodi had urged for a change in government lease policy
A transcript of a phone call introduced in ICAC in August and September 2007 Mr. Obide and Mr. Tripod and Steve Dunn, a senior officer who came to the Fisheries Department of Mr. Obide after the Ministry of Ports worked
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. " Was the development of commercial leasing policy discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can’t remember what I was talking about, but it certainly wasn’t.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obi-Wan.
Officials say Israeli fighter jets have been rushing in Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted Syria's port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative officer confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not say what the purpose was, but there was necessarily at least one purpose.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian missile SA-125.
Israel has failed to carry out air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can pass the "authenticity" test
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign employees on the 457 visa, as it aims to extend a rigorous procedure.
If adopted, this test will be applied through a standard designed to prevent 457 being used to fill unskilled positions in Australia or to be delivered to family and friends in a disguised manner.
A government discussion letter was issued today, denouncing the government's vocabulary about foreign workers, former Labour MP Maxine McQueen said today that it could anger Australia's neighbors.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that "foreign people are reaching the end of the queue" and "Australian people get jobs first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have demanded a safe labour market.
Historically, it meant that white workers should be provided with protection - and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the area saw the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures, which were first considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about the people who smuggled, has implemented five substantive changes while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined as to "whether the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominated person, the owner of the person sponsoring the visa is a relative or personal companion of the corresponding person."
Businesses may need to keep counting the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor fewer employees hired hundreds of people.
During this, 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of suspicious heart attack after arriving in a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's awkward nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and on Wednesday, after his father's death, one of his adult cousins, who was on the same boat, has been tied up.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died on the same day.
A study has been announced by the British government to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project in Scotland.
Works by HS2 indicate high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kremer said that the project will "become one with the UK."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very "encouraged" by working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second stage is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, instructed HS2 Ltd. to consider further improvements in rail capacity and travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2, as its benefits will be very high.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities in the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be connected due to HS2 and well.
According to Scottish Secretary Elistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
"Scotland is likely to have huge economic benefits from high-speed rail, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland as a whole in the case of high-speed rail across the UK," Brown said.
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government, so that we can explore options for bringing high-speed rail to Scotland, creating benefits for all and completing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British government ministers next year and deciding jointly on further action.
Aircraft Electrical Equipment Rules Will Be Effective In Australia Right Now
Despite the steps being taken to soften equipment regulations in the US, Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones while flying and when the plane lands.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left options open for U.S. aviation service companies to change their processes so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical stages of flight, provided they remain in the equipment "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can still do this during many flights, but many people do not feel it is good to be unable to access their e-books while flying and landing the plane.
Australian aviation service companies are considering this decision, according to which U.S. aviation service companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have an immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment at important stages of flight in Australia are still effective.
"Currently, CASA has no specific regulation regulating the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the Authority said, "This issue falls under the regulations, according to which it is up to the aircraft service operating companies to ensure that the safety arrangements of the aircraft have always been fully maintained, or
Virgin, who is already negotiating with CASA about extending the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she asked to proceed on the regulator's instructions.
"We will welcome the review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, because we really think it will provide a better experience to customers, because now we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes."
Quantas said it will abide by the current rules now.
"According to our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during take-off and landing of aircraft, and we do not have an immediate plan to change it,"" he said."
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind them.
The impact of this decision will be different for each U.S. airline and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can withstand radio frequencies from mobile devices, as well as they will have to revise their rules booklets, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and provide brief details to passengers.
The FAA said that "after verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by airlines, it will allow passengers to use lightweight, hand-held electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all heights."
In virtual cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment while landing the aircraft.
The group has also suggested placing heavy equipment safely under the seat or in upper compartments during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Silver of Ponbrokers due to the difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirathlinga is taking cash at the Panshop at the Bendemire Shopping Centre in Singapore to pay her daughter's school fees by giving her gold bullion, rings and bracelets.
"""My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it,"" she said."
She says that although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars ($2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of South-East Asia - where domestic debt is rising - for the volumemax where they are making their transactions, listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Keeping jewelry tied is not the only way to get cash - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, Ponbrokers in Singapore take 17 per cent interest per year, which is just over 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary, and they can make loans available faster than the bank.
Thousands of people in the region are turning to Ponshop due to rising living expenses by families and rising domestic and consumer debts.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial disaster, and after cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families have been able to meet their needs due to the slowdown of their economy.
This week, the ratings agency, Standards Angel Resources, cited rising domestic profits, mainly due to rising mortgages (mortgages), as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said that Asia has the highest ratio of domestic debt to gross domestic product in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged slightly from the tech slowdown this week.
On Thursday, data showed a steady decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"The crucial point is that with rising prices, [income scale] people from the middle class to the lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way,"" said Sung Sung Won, economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB."
Historically high values in gold values over the past two years have prompted people to hold back personal assets, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to reap the value of their family jewelry.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items that are stored in the city-state's 200-pon outlet are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold looks good, let's put the grandmother's gold chain on hold, and we'll take it back next month."
Thailand's largest Ponshop operator, Ejimani, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
There is such a growth in the holding business that the operator of the outlet in Bendimir, Valuemax, and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand to Malaysia, not only in their neighborhood, where it has four stores, but also to expand out of Asia.
The company will use 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week to fund the project.
While some discounted lenders (lenders) have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says holding a mortgage not only gets an affordable rate compared to other lenders, but it does not directly increase the loan either.
"Customers hold back items they already have, and personal assets don't increase the amount of home debt they owe," she says.
The social acceptability of Ponbroking is increasing in order to obtain short-term and secure financial support.
It's not that Ponbrokers are used only by financially weak individuals.
Rich people in Singapore also use the Valuemax outlets, they hold down gold bars or Rolex watches so that up to 60 percent of their purchase price can be paid in cash.
We have clients from all walks of life.
Ms. Yah says, "This includes wealthy people who need loans for a short period of time for business ventures or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements."
Sometimes they just need money in a very short time.
India's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani is celebrating his 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a big party on the occasion.
Many big stars of Bollywood arrived in Jodhpur to celebrate the party. Late in the evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching Jodhpur's flight at Mumbai airport.
These stars include Karishma Kapoor, Gita Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Obviously, you can guess how big the water will be when such big names join the party.
A $325 million bailout package for Taggie's health
The federal government has insisted that strict conditions are also attached with a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ill health system that will ensure that the state government cannot waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plimbersek has announced that the Commonwealth, the island state is taking "urgent action" to resolve the current crisis due to the ageing population, high rates of contagious diseases, and systemic limitations.
The decision of funding to be made during the four years, was made after consultation of the government with the independent MP of Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the particular challenges facing the state,"" she said."
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million alternative surgical plan.
2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will assist in solving the past collected cases.
It also includes funds for the introduction of walk-in clinics, improved post-hospital care, training of medical specialists, mental health services and personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the best methods I have been told by leading physicians to improve Tasmania's health system,"" she said."
The Minister stressed that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive the Commonwealth funds, and report each month on where the additional funds are being spent.
A Commission of three members shall be constituted to ensure that the service is rendered by the State as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said that $325 million would not mean too much, "unless real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more conducive level."
Nevertheless, he commended the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he had first brought before the Prime Minister in early May."
"""I hope that the federal aid package will prove very helpful in separating the state-run public health system from the crisis-affected list,"" Wilkie said."
According to the State Government, these additional alternative procedures will largely undo the cuts made recently.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-ad solution."
"We are here for the reason that the Labour State government has taken $430 million into its health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't see the state government taking nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth giving 300 million dollars as a day of good news.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plimbersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the defence package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to make chemical weapons.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria had destroyed important equipment to make chemical weapons and poisonous gas war materials, while fierce fighting erupted in the northern part of Syria, which is too close to the place where poisonous agents are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group said that nearly 120,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's civil war, which began nearly three years ago.
This announcement by the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organization has taken place a day before the final date of November 1.
The Hague-based organization assigned Dumskes to destroy or "ineffectively" all the machinery used to mix chemicals in chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and fill war material.
Mainly to complete the initial stage of destruction, this ambitious development is a significant milestone with the aim of destroying all chemical weapons of Dumskes by mid-2014.
Destruction means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Dumskes still has to destroy the existing weapons and collection.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mastered gas and nerve agent sarin.
Britain's position The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that the announcement came at a time when fighting in the Safira city on Thursday escalated, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage center.
The movement, which details the number of dead through a network of movements in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
Of these, 6,365 children, including 61,067 ordinary citizens, he said.
The government has said 29,954 members of President Bashar Assad's military, 18,678 fighters in favour of the government and 187 Lebanese are Hizbullah militants.
It also said that the dead include 2,202 army foes and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. estimated that nearly 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Nearly 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Assad's military continued to fight rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said that people on both sides were injured but clearly said nothing.
This war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to end toxic weapons in Syria in a very short period of time during the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team "is now satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen - destroyed all of Syria's declared significant production and mixing/filling equipment."
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said they had completed the first phase of verification work by going to 21 of the 23 centres declared by Dumskes.
The inspectors said they were not able to go to the two centres for security reasons.
The OPCW said on Friday that the two centers have been "abandoned and... chemical weapons products placed there have been delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira, is one of those two centres, where the OPCW was not able to go to the inspector.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the OPCW's Executive Committee next month.
"I congratulate the perseverance and encouragement shown by you in completing the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,"" said Ahmet Ujumku, Director General of the group, who oversees the comment issued by the OPCW."
The three-year civil war is mainly a struggle between the Assad government and its security forces, including members of Shia Islam, the Al-White cult, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the observatory, said that there was a blast at the air defence centre in the coastal area of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known, he said.
The police have recovered photocopies of fake registers, fake seals, laptops and fake registers from the possession of the accused.
The Moti Nagar police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said the arrested accused include Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar in Habowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohra and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has fled the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with the clerk and record keeper of the office, Balbir Singh, took out papers from the records of empty and old lands and then bought new stamp paper and prepared forged registers on them.
It was not until then that the real register was disappeared and the forged register was raised in the record.
Thereafter, the accused sold the land in crores of rupees on fake papers.
At the same time, these loans were taken on fake paper.
After that, the real owner of the land was pushed by the police and administration.
The accused who prepared the forged registers were paying particular attention to the lands of the NRI.
Because there is no one to look after the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare a fake register of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused said in the interrogation that they have prepared nearly 150 forged registers so far.
According to the police, there have been cases of fraud and theft against Sargana Rajiv.
Angry over the conviction of the conspirator of the bomb explosion in Bali
The relatives and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 bomb blast, outraged by the sentence given to the conspirator of the bomb blast, said Umar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who ran as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted individuals for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb blast yesterday.
He can be released in 15 years if he is given his parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the Kuta's famous tourist area, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many.
He has also been convicted of numerous other terrorism-related charges, including a chain bomb blast in a church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, though they could also have demanded the death penalty of this person, known as the infamous "destructive person" who made the bomb.
The decision refreshed the painful memories of June Cortine, a woman living in Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his grievances, he said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should have received the same punishment as other fierce terrorists.
Ms. Courten told A.A.P., "He should be put in front of the firing squad."
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, just after 11 p.m., the namelessness of the club disappeared after the explosion of a bomb loaded in a van outside the entire club.
Peter Hugues, a suicide bomber, was in the paddies bar at the time of the blast just 20 seconds before the bag was packed with explosives.
He went into a long coma for a month as a result of the bomb blast and was "dead" three times while living on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hugues says that Patek should have received the same sentence as the three other members of the Jammah Islamiyah terrorist group responsible for this massacre - Amroji, Mukhalas and Imam Mara - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given the death penalty before anyone else.
There's no reason to keep him alive, there's no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless people, it is not enough to get a 20-year sentence.
Patek, Bali is the last person to be convicted of one of the bomb explosions.
He survived being captured for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military had shot down former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an effort to re-establish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
Ms. Courten says, "He did not surrender."
Even today, so many people do not really suffer from mental distress.
The decision came ahead of this year's 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year,"" Ms. Courten said."
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
F.A.A.: Air passengers can now use gadgets in aircraft (but can't call from cell phone)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music, from entering the gate to landing from the gate. But they will not be able to talk to their cell phones - such as Diwani Nawaz Shah - by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers shouldn’t expect these changes to happen immediately.
At a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Huarta said how quickly these changes are implemented, it will be different for each airline, according to the company.
The airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA how their aircraft are complying with the new guidelines, and how the training manuals of their crew members and the rules for collecting devices are being updated to show the guidelines.
The FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on board the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among those airlines that have already submitted plans.
The FAA said in a statement, "Based on the status of the scheme, we can very quickly approve the extended use of the electronic device."
Currently, passengers need to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane's door is closed.
They are expected not to turn them on until they reach a height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and are allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their device again when the plane lands, and not to start it until the plane lands completely.
According to the FAA, under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic interference can allow their passengers to fly by plane, land the aircraft and use the device during taxiing, the statement said.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified in a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Inspectors, has welcomed these changes as well.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy is implemented in a safe way - and we will work together with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we are bored with feeling like "hall monitors."
But surfing, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting to the Internet at altitudes below 10,000 feet will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, games like online scrape, which is associated with the famous event that when the actor Alec Baldwin, played on his smartphone while staying at the aircraft park in 2011, in the year 2011, and he was forbidden to turn off the device.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected as their jump will worry about hurting another person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be restricted during the flight.
The regulatory powers related to the phone call are with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the FAA.
The FAA may remove restrictions on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rozenkan of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is the national transport safety expert at CBS News, said the cell phone is still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really serious issues, not only because they can potentially cause interference in navigation-related devices, but also because they can cause interference in cell phone towers when in the air," Rosenkar said.
The Industry Jagat Consulting Committee, formed by the FAA to examine the issue, last month wrote that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The F.A.A. has been on the rise in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Clare McCaskill, D-Mo, have said there is no legitimate reason for the ban.
Enforcement of these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the use of the device is omnipresent.
Some studies also get this indication that nearly a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996, when reports of disruption in navigation and communication devices were received due to the passengers carrying F.M. radio and high-tech gadgets at the time.
New airlines are more reliant on electric systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitude from passengers for many years.
The modified planes for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to disruption.
Huarta said that most airlines should comply with eligibility criteria for more use of electronic devices under the new directives, the company said.
Today's electronic devices, emitting radio transmissions of much less power than the previous generation of electronic devices.
For example, e-readers, there is a transmission of exactly the nominal while reversing the page.
Transmissions, however, prevail when the device downloads or transmits data.
Amazon.com has also been among those in favour of reducing restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers on the airline and flew them to test for problems, but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed sentiments about the risks posed by the use of the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Air Passenger Association said he believes the disruption to the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device being disrupted in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee agreed that the FAA pilot should be allowed to order passengers to turn off the device when the aircraft is landed in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and said it is a common knowledge facility for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
The C.E.O. of the U.S. Travel Association, Roger Doe, said: "We are delighted that the FAA has acknowledged that travelling with pleasure is not incompatible with safety, rescue and safety.
Taking lessons from the silliness bombings in Patna, the UT police have taken up room for a quick response during Diwali celebrations and during the emergency.
A total of 1,800 soldiers will be deployed in all the main places of the city, crowded markets, and other places, including vehicles, to apprehend the perpetrators for seizure of traffic systems, preventing hurricane events, teaching lessons to the pilgrims, etc.
Female policemen, including PCR, traffic unit, will be included in these jawans.
Police personnel and commandos will also check duty records at other places, including hotels, guest houses and PGs.
The SHO has been directed to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the cases.
The DSP has also been entrusted with investigating markets, malls and other places, including VIP sectors in the city.
Due to the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the high authorities have also set the duty of additional police personnel in police control in view of the convenience of the people.
The police have asked the fire department and the PGI director, the Principal Director and the DHS to maintain high alert in the emergency time from the staff of other dispensers other than Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCH management.
Department officials have now assigned others, including women police personnel, under the leadership of the NGO, to the task of teaching the Manchals a lesson.
Anti-Gunda staff will be detained in crowded places, including markets, in plain clothes.
All the SHOs on Diwali have been ordered to place 44 nails in the inner areas of the city.
Police personnel will also be stationed at 38 Naka points on the city's borders.
The bird was left back in the forest by air for protection from the North Sea rig
The bird found on the North Sea Oil rig has been left in the forest by air transport back from the coast.
The bird, called the Water Rail, was sent by the Scottish SPCA to Aberdeen by helicopter before recovering back to their rescue center located in Aloe.
"This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, which came under the sweeping winds above the North Sea," said Centre Manager Colin Seden.
It seems that the bird was tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
He further stated: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help."
The waterways were clean and tidy before leaving.
Is Europe's upper class ready to do business with the UK?
Business for the UK was launched in April and a commitment was made to bring business together and determine what changes we want to see in our relationship with the UK's Employment and Prosperity Manufacturers E.U.
For him, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they think about the UK’s business with the EU.
U-Gov took on the idea of 1,000 business leaders, who are representatives of the UK's business size, regions and locations.
The findings of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large proportion of businesspeople now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming motionless.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than engage in the long-term and drastic process of reforming the EU's mysterious institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these crucial qualifications should come back to Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of Brussels’ regulation is far more than the benefits of becoming a part of Europe’s business sector – even huge businessmen who were traditionally in favour of European companies. 40 percent of the respondents said this
Finally and most obviously, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part clearly wants the UK to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This finding, which was seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are pushing for a "significant change" that would give the UK back its lost power.
Its price is very high - the issue of treaty change for Britain and getting a better deal changed 16 percent in favour of staying in the EU in the vote-collection.
The prime minister should not be in any doubt: it is the survey diary that British businessmen, the EU, support their plan to negotiate the terms of the UK's membership.
It also showed that businessmen, expect to renegotiate making a significant change in favour of the UK to the current power balance.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming compulsory very quickly, as the eurozone, the allied economy and the fiscal union are moving forward.
Priority must be given to jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that for businesspeople this means a new focus on business and fundamental changes in Brussels’ regulatory working method.
Gazprom's Alexi Miller has announced the start of a new pipeline in Bulgaria.
The construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today is a historic event: construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom president Alexey Miller said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream, will provide diversity in Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said that a dispute over the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is for Europe, poses a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, eliminating "forever" the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries.
After the entire project is launched in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at exempt rates from the South Stream after the start of the project.
Gajprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Earlier, the Royal Commission heard allegations of sexual offences against two YMCA employees before the allegations against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA N.S.W. employees have been charged with child sexual offenses before charges were filed against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But it said in a statement before the commission that it "never encountered a case of child sexual harassment within its organization," the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which YMCA Caringbah was accused of taking care of YMCA Jim Instructor Bhadra in the year 1991
Advocate Gail Farnese, who assisted the Commission, said he knew about the first case but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the statement of the YMCA before the Commission that "the YMCA has been externally investigated and they have found the YMCA at the forefront in the matter of child safety" is also not accurate.
The evidence before the Commission is that the YMCA was notified, and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Greene, who is 21 years of age affiliated with YMCA, admitted that the Lord's appointment resulted in the failure of the management of "yourself including me" and failed to ensure that the employees were notified of the violations of the Child Protection Policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year term in YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that the YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which employees did not report child safety violations by the Lord.
The staff gave evidence of what they saw about the violation, including spending time alone with the children by Lord, making them privately babysitting, sitting them in foster care, telling them that he loves them and letting them play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell who was under Lord's supervision, and she had asked for child safety training, because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the YMCA who oversaw Lord's "Caringbah Child Service Manager" in Mehdi Mehdi Mehdi Jaqqi Barnat "
The C.E.O. said that it did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above their manager.
Rather, his friendship with the Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had provided the YMCA N.S.W. Board with his view that the text to the organization from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "about not giving information".
Mr. Hare said the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees immediately after the allegations were made, was made by YMCA's child welfare manager Liam Whiteley.
He said the purpose of this was to avoid mixing the evidence, but it was not executed "excessively" and correctly.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, Specialist on Child Sexual Exploitation at Griffith University, said that YMCA NASW was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's tenure between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, supervision, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been adjourned until December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to Britain
Tony Blair said he would like a chance to be Britain's prime minister again - but he believes there is no chance of a return.
In an interview taken overnight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007, after a decade as a leader, Mr. Blair largely refrained from discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and Middle East Group peacemakers.
Asked if they would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair was presented by London's Ewing Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but that is unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When the crowd of experts demonstrating horses for the best horse of the year gathered in Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even going to school yet and a few months away from taking his first step, this young child and his palut Shetland Taft took three stages with great ease and got the top prize - he left behind his 30 adult competitors.
In the annual competition held by the Sunnyback Equatorial Centre near Cardiff, the inseparable pair - which is Sk itself of length - was highly praised for its appearance, behavior and style.
In front of the men and women wearing beautiful baller hats, she tilted her flat hat to a rough angle and twisted her two-year-old toffee into a ring.
The decision makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control that is far ahead of his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for her appearance and personality.
Fenton was given Toffee as a gift on her third birthday last March, and she has since practiced with this tattoo from Shetland every day.
Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a fantastic couple."
They had to face a challenge from all the candidates, but they both won the Gold Cup and the Rosette.
It was only his second chance when he took part in a competition with Toffee, and we are all very happy about his victory.
The most different in this color scheme, he felt so amazing that they wanted to shoot photos with him.
This little boy from Nantigolo village near Ab Well, South Wales is walking in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells who has been demonstrating horses for more than 10 years.
Smt. Howells said: "The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everyone was cheering and laughing."
He was running on the sand throughout the background, and even though he looked so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is a madman of animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two breeding chickens that he cares for.
The kind of start he's made will be at the best horse show of the year long ago - and I'm confident he'll perform very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he comes to control his tatoo."
They are a very good couple.
The decision makers gave scores based on the performance of Fenton and Toffee and the way they were presented in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between Tutu and his rider - in this case, Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm absolutely confident that Fenton's lovely clothes have helped him, he was actually looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper will be "renewing" the argument.
A Chinese newspaper that had made an appeal on the front page to leave a reporter convicted of defamation would be reinstated, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou newspaper New Express had given a viral public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write detailed news about the state-owned company.
The regulator said that now the new express has to undergo "complete reform."
The "reform" came from the Guangdong Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Ewing News Group's New Express had printed a lot of fake news about the listed company Joomla in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of New Express was disorderly."
It said it had decided to impose an administrative penalty by "cancelling the license of a Chen Yongzhou reporter."
It had "directed the Yangcheng Ewing News Group to complete a complete reform of the New Express, to examine the people responsible for it in the New Express and to immediately modify the leadership team of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in the New Express that blamed financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Joomla.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published a two-page appeal for his release, saying he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came on state television, admitting to writing and publishing false stories for money.
"""In this case, I have damaged Joomla as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win people's trust,"" he told state broadcaster CCCTV."
I did it mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I am aware of my mistakes.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front page apology stating that it had failed to properly examine his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have made television broadcast fault-acceptance.
Experts say that from time to time, forcible acknowledgment is made, despite the fact that a law in the latter half of this year prohibited the authorities from forcing a person to convict himself.

U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel finds its own railroad
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot-multiple three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes to be discovered so far.
The tunnel is about the same length as the crooked-tailed six-foot pitch, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being filled with drugs.
Officials said it was stopped before a drug was passed through the tunnel.
According to court records, the authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel search.
Three persons, about whom officials said they were acting as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of huge underground water drainage canals.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the marijuana crop in central Mexico in October, which poses the challenge of drug mafia groups able to quickly reach consumers of the product.
In 2010, officials found a route of about 700 yards equipped with rail tracks, stretching from the kitchen of a home in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.

The British police sent a notice of extradition to Assange.
British police sent an extradition notice today to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "surrender notice" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to be present at the police station, as well as saying that if he failed to do so, he would be responsible for being arrested himself.
Asanje is facing extradition in Sweden due to allegations of sexual offences, as well as his option under British law expired at the time while the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm would hand them over to the U.S., fearing they had asked the South American country for political asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London on June 19.
A spokesperson said that Scotland Yard has sent "a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, for which he needed to be present at the police station on the date and time we chose."
He is in breach of his bail terms.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-privacy website called WikiLeaks, the United States will be extradited from Sweden to face potential espionage charges.
A fine of <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph with a hot drink between the legs
On the driver, he has been fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving at a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) by putting hot drinks between his legs.
Tiptry, a 35-year-old from Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Brentrich on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a tech-ave drink on their feet.
In the Colchester Magistrate Court, Howie has admitted the charge of negligent driving.
Seven points were added to his license, which resulted in him being banned from driving for six months.
Hovey was also ordered to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
A tax on foreign property owners will end London's artificial status.
The Department of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who gave the houses priced at over 2 million pounds in the 2012 budget, and the person who is an isolated person, a company, to a house worth 7 per cent
The stamp duty received from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kentucky and Chelsea in the tax year 2012/13 was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, which is already Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire.
"""After the rise in stamp duty of high-value homes and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance Legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a reasonable lesser tax on high-value property than there is an effect of an outdated system of taxation,"" Cook said."
"But this move could make some foreign investors silent in buying assets in London and reluctant to sell them to current owners," he added.
The top 5 to 10 percent share of the housing market, spread from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8 percent last year as per the price in the wealthy south-west London.
According to Saville's research, Central London's values continued to grow 5.6 percent regularly each year, but growing was slightly less likely than the "domestic market", as the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) were seeing a surge.
Scientists have further highlighted the relationship between the actions of the dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tails too far to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while restless dogs move their tails mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and express their reaction to it.
The study has been published in the Journal of Biology.
Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Trento Georgia Vallertigra said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in different ways in that stimulus that excites positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
Like humans, the right part of the brain in dogs was responsible for left arm movements and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to one-sided dummy shaking by other dogs, the researchers looked at the animals watching other dogs' films.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won’t take us much longer to understand why their dummy sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
"We introduced the dogs with dog films - in the shadow-picture to deal with the realistic version or other confusing issues, and we could see the action of the tail and the tail was more left-handed or right-handed."
When the animals saw a non-sensitive dog moving their tails to the right (from the dog's point of view), they were completely rested.
But when they saw the tail turning mainly to the left (from the dog's point of view), their heartbeat increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Wellertigra, they do not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these actions.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what action they should be concerned about and not about.
"If you've met with other dogs many times, and if they constantly shake their tails to one side, it's related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience."
The researchers say these findings can provide better information about animal feelings to owners, veterinarians and trainers.
John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol’s School of Veterinary Sciences, said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right part is important to dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another research from the University of Victoria in Canada, he noted: "Unlike Italian studies - when the robot dog's tail was pushed to the left, dogs were more likely to get closer to him than to be restless."
He said the difference was because in various studies, dogs did not fully understand animals or robot dogs in movies.
He clarified that studying how dogs react to real dogs can help in this.
"While there has been considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be obtained - and dogs are no exception in this case," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we probably won’t take much longer to understand why their dummies sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic monkeys postponed Glassgo Gig due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock Bank, an arctic monk, has postponed the gig in Glasgow after suffering from the stiffness of its lead singer.
The Sheffield Group's program was scheduled to perform at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But his major singer Alex Turner's illness forced him to redefine the show's date.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were forced to postpone the gig in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic manikin said: After taking medical advice tonight after the decision to postpone the show at the Birmingham LG Arena, the Arctic manikin will also show in Glasgow Hydro on November 1, on Friday.
"Alex Turner was found strangled in the investigation, and they are sadly unable to perform."
The LG Arena in Birmingham will now be showcased on November 20, while the Glasgow Hydro will be showcased on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for this show.

Pope Francis to announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will form the new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term of office on February 22.
The cardinals, the Catholic Church have high-ranking pastors, their posts are only below the pope, and these are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his individuals, who will eventually help choose their successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - it comes in the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of promotion of the new cardinals, a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held, which is called the Pope's Assembly.
"Pope Francis has decided to inform in advance of his decision to hold the February pope's council, so that it is easier to plan other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different countries of the world,"" Lombardi said."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline by February.
He said that in general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, as many cardinals, and as they wish, the names of cardinals over 80 years of age.
Valero said, next year's pope's assembly will be important, as it will be the first pope's assembly after France's election in March this year.
There is currently a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new popes, also nominated by the cardinals from the rest of the world, will restore balance," he said.
In South America there are forty percent Roman Catholics, but their numbers in the Cardinals are very few.
The Council of Cardinals by Francis - which is a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose work is to look for ways to reform the Church, will also be the first cardinals to be elected after being formed.
Before that, the Pope made all the decisions on his own.
"Now, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,"" Valero said."
He said it is "possible" that Francis seeks advice from the Cardinals.
But we're not in this situation before - it's completely new.
Valero said that the popes usually give the bishop of large places the post of cardinal, but Francis "would be completely surprised - so we don't know who they will announce the name of."
GM calls back pickup trucks in U.S. to correct seatback
General Motors Company, its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sera pickup trucks, has backed up about 19,000 trucks to correct a shortage in hand-held seatbacks, according to a report by U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday
Some trucks may have a deficiency in the front seat rotating system.
As a result, the union failed to comply with auto safety standards regarding seatback, head restraint.
According to a statement posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle is trapped from behind, it is possible that the head restraint, the driver, could not adequately protect, which would increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
The GM's trucks began shipping in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, it represents the most important vehicle launch for the top U.S. automakers.
The GM had informed the truck owners about the fault in the latter part of October.
Due to the N.S.T.M.A. 16-day government detention, which had disrupted the increase in sales of the car in October, Swami could not review the notification letter.
G.M. said Friday, in sales of Silverado and Sera trucks that were redesigned for the 2014 model year, there was a 20 per cent increase in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM had sold 42,660 silverado and 16,503 serum pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the New York Stock Exchange saw a 1.4 per cent jump in GM's shares.
Obama's voters are disillusioned.
I voted for Obama twice in anticipation of change.
He says Obama's great efforts have been halted due to the GOP's blockade policy
Blockade policy Obamacare website's inconveniences, can't justify drone attacks
The Obama campaign's 2008 memoir of the year reminds us of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading very sad books.
This is a book that I think will inspire me during the second year of medical school poisoning and awaken the rays of hope in me.
It is called "The Courage to Win" and is a commemoration of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get sick of my patients' bedsheets at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time when politics has inspired millions of people and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers had paused to show the historical significance of the time.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents saved every newspaper they received.
A team of young visionary individuals was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had 82 percent approval ratings when he became President of the United States in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh truth, like returning from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
It really changed after I got the first vote by myself.
Simply put, I couldn’t have imagined any of this.
I credit Obama with many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our army from Iraq, from the end of "Don't Ask" to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the policy of partisan opposition has hindered many efforts of our country to move forward: including immigrant reform, public choices for health care, shutting down ports on Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the countless times I have taken the side of the Obama administration in front of colleagues and colleagues, I have the answer that I can give them.
I have reached a point of political disappointment.
The Republican's opposition policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency storing data about the privacy of ordinary American citizens nor can it respond to prosecutions against people who expose the wrong actions of the government.
This cannot explain the reason for the murder of U.S. citizen Anwar El Avalaki without a trial, nor the low public funds and spending limits during the Presidential Campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says the White House's attempts to silence the media "have been the most aggressive ever since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, even after three years of being signed into law the Affordable Care Act can’t justify the failure to design a simple website.
I don’t know what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of governance, could overturn the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is clear that the elected office is not a predictable path, as the anti-political parties and random events such as the Newtown assassination will shape our public discussion.
Yet the examples I have given above seem to be mostly self-chosen by the administration.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his nomination.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain choice, which did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to the year 2008 through that book.
When I see him, I remember the promises he made.
A portion of the book was being read this week, describing how Clinton suffered a huge loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate employees that they need to return to work, and stay true to their goals.
He said, "I want to get my money back."
We need to remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Moris.
Clive Palmer claims P.M. Tony Abbott's interest in paternity leave scheme is conflicting
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbotts interest in the paternity leave scheme is a struggle because his daughters may be pregnant, and can benefit from it.
The mining sector's Maharathi, who is in controversy over the $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed while trying to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be important in determining whether to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only the interests of ministers can be conflicted, and said Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
"He may have an important interest in the matter of paternity leave, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they get leave,"" said Mr. Palmer."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for the recounting of elections to accelerate the process.
Tony Aut's daughters are Francis and Bridget.
Should the result of the election come two months after we are voting?
"""We need to have a better system."
Why can't we have a system in which we fill our distribution on the computer, vote immediately and have results at 6:30 in the evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencil to mark ballots.
That's because if a person doesn't like him, can the wax erase him?
The use of pencil in today's time seems ridiculous.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint interview letter with New Zealand.
The 59-year-old said his policies would include building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he would take his new task "very seriously."
The public office is for public service.
"We need no award other than the history award that we can serve the community at this critical time,"" he said."
As a result, the protesters had to be troubled.
Speaking at the meeting on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his fierce anger at the deteriorating law and order in the state.
The increasing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that the perpetrators have been fearless, he said.
There is no fear of police and administrative arrangements.
Referring to recent incidents in different places, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily estimated.
RBS has suspended two forex traders.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange exchange department, this information was obtained from two experts in the case, another indication that there is a suspicious manipulation of the currency market by the regulators. The global investigation-discovery conducted by the regulators
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the investigation-basement at the world's largest financial market, which exchanges $5.3 trillion each day.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS to be suspended with further probe into the case that appears to be a recurrence of interbank loan manipulation candy.
The bank has declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "Our investigation in this case is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators."
Last month, experts from the case had said that RBS had sent it to the former trader and had sent the records of emails and instant messages received from him to the UK Regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader named Richard Usher had left RBS in the year 2010, and it is believed that it has been removed from his current position as the European head of forex spot trading in J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot trading in the city, went on vacation last week, while former senior karensi trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by the standard charter this week.
Neither of these traders has been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts from the case said that the quick message group of Mr. Usher includes bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said that, after being told by the Swiss regulator, Finma, that it is investigating suspicious manipulation of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss backs, this week it has taken action against some of its employees.
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, the Competition Authority of Switzerland (VCO), the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are reluctant to impose their favorable fluctuations in the currency market on the bankers.
Those familiar with the case said, HSBC, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted an internal investigation, or have received requests for information from regulators.
Banks are investigating instant messaging and emails for years to come in search of clues to a wrong activity.
News about the probe-wrapping, has sparked turmoil in traders of such sectors, which have been among the most profitable individuals in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing a challenge this year, as there is less fluctuation in the trends in the Karnataka.
Some bankers have tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to manipulate a very large and highly liquid forex exchange market, but senior traders say that this is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the extremely large volume of forex buy-sale, liquidity between different trading platforms and the growing use of their own platforms by banks can be disrupted. Influencing the "you're a little less priced" market means that
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that the trader would be serviced this week from its Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London, which lost nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We believe that the trader acted alone, and he has been controlled,"" Credit Suisse said."

The Supreme Court backed the Obama Health Service Act.
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Health Services Act constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
With 5-4 votes, the judges decided in favour of the Separate Order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act - under which citizens would be required to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty before the year 2014 - that it is under the power of the Government to impose tax.
Chief Justice John Roberts supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges, Scalia, Thos, Elito and Kennedy, disagreed.
The court has also backed the remaining articles of the law, which are 2,700 pages long, and said that the condition of the Health Services Act that the state increases Medicare eligibility or they will give away all federal Medicare funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was brought by 26 states, and the National Independent Business Federation, to prevent this law.
During the initial session of 2012, this law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including the projected nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that our work cannot work without money.
Wealth is one of the greatest needs for life, but it is not in our best interest to accept it all.
We celebrate Krishna Triodashi of Kartik Mass as Dhanteras.
Dhanteras is worshipped by Kuber, the god of wealth, and Yamraj, the god of death.
Wealth has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
We have a good feeling about our money.
No other thing can be more valuable than the wealth that has worked for the welfare of mankind, but the wealth that has caused egoism has no meaning.
We make money for a holy purpose and spend it for a holy purpose.
It is the duty of every individual to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some of it should also have a sense of spending on society, but inadvertent collection or the tendency to earn yen-can-like money destroys our discretion, personality.
The spirit of charity should always be kept in mind.
A portion of the money you give can also be the basis of someone's life or life.
We all need to think for them that many people in society are living in terrible deprivation.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the men's stones of life.
All men desire wealth and success, and according to their selfishness they also receive wealth and success.
It is the same wealth that is sustained with respect.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he can neither consume it properly nor do any other work.
If you have money, don't give it to anyone else.
The true rich is the one who makes the way flow in the hands of the innumerable wealth.
There can be no more misuse of money than the creation of employment for others.
Another thing is that money is not just a currency.
It would also be like your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of the money.

Ejaz Jan, MLA of the Poonch Assembly constituency, inaugurated the water cooler at Gurdwara campus.
The MLA said a large number of people are coming and going in Gurdwara, but water coolers have been installed due to the lack of proper drinking water system.

Other members of the Gurudwara Committee were also present on the occasion.
After the general election, the new government would not get kerosene at these stores in half a dozen states if it continued its policy of stopping sales of kerosene through rations.
The states in which kerosene is to be sold include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, there is also preparation to stop sales of kerosene in some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the northeast.
According to sources from the Ministry of Petroleum, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS stores in the states on two basis.
The first base is being built for fast electricity connections in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, where most rural families have been given kitchen gas connections, the sale of PDS kerosene is being closed.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made preparations in this regard.
PDS kerosene has already been sold in Delhi since October, 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand have significantly reduced kerosene quotas.
The quota of Punjab was reduced from 2.72 lakh litres to one lakh litres.
Haryana's kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 per cent to 70 per cent in the Uttarakhand allocation.
Despite these cuts, there has been no news of kerosene in these states.
The ministry believes that it is clear that kerosene is being used for misuse.
The price of PDS Kerosin and diesel is currently Rs 37.
This increases the number of interlocutors.
In the states where PDS will shut down sales, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
Currently, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The cost of kerosene subsidies in 2013-14 is estimated to be around Rs 31,000 crore.
The accused, citing the trading firm, opened the accounts of the investors and forged the purchase-sale of shares in the name of the company.
Probably, for the first time in the state, such a revelation has revealed a fraud of crores of rupees.
The police have not yet reached him, but seven persons, including the accused who watched his work in the state, have been detained by the police.
The group operated a counterfeit commodity market called Metatrader-5.
The company's actors used to make fake IDs on a fake software, taking cash from investors.
This was used to look at the shares bought by the investors when trading.
It was even known at what price the shares were bought.
In fact, no shares were bought and there was no transaction for it, as no demate accounts of investors were opened and the shares on this fake software were faked.
The police estimate that hundreds of people have come to the mob.
Up to Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh was invested in the name of making a profit from each investor.
Its main accused Amit Soni has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, while his other six colleagues have been arrested from Indore.
According to A.D.G. Cyber Cell Ashok, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
After that, the company can only trade shares through its own investors.
The investor's demate account is then opened so that shares can be bought and sold for it, but the company named Metatrader-5 was neither affiliated with any exchange nor was stock trading.
The company had purchased servers for itself on September 24, 2012, citing trading in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people have been harassed in the name of investment through this company.
Eight merchants from Indore who have lodged a complaint in the cyber cell have been spotted.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profit, their amount was not transferred to their account.
On this, he began to demand profits from the actors of the company.
Investors are even saying that the price of their purchased shares was always lower on the fake ID given to them.
The price was decided by the accused at their own level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Mumbai.
Agents advised people to join the company by greeding for more profits.
After that, Rs 2 lakh would be deposited to Rs 5 lakh.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Dinath Mangeshkar Hospital, on Friday attacked the Congress at an election rally.
"""Sometimes in many states and centers of the country there was a coalition government, sometimes a Congress government, sometimes a communist government, sometimes a BJP government,"" Modi said."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I appeal to the political pandits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be set in the country.
What did the team do?
If it comes to a comparative result, the country will not be faced with the question of whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever and wherever the BJP government is formed, attempts have been made to meet the public aspirations.
The country witnessed low inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had two meals.
But when the Congress or its backed government was formed, the poor man had no chance to eat.
A single Congress leader, a single UPA leader, is not responding to what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country cannot reach them.
The Congress has become egotistical.
They don't even respond to the media.
The election is for the Lok Sabha, you answer to the people.
Speaking on the attack on Congress leader Kapil Sibal, Modi is being asked questions these days. When the people will bless the BJP in 2014, then every year he will give an account of his work before the people.
In a democracy, a ruler should not sit in Delhi, a servant should sit.
There can be no nath in Delhi, there should only be slaves.
Friends of Congress leave the balloons for the next few days.
"We've had our exams 10 months ago, my friends.
In a democracy, the people are in control.
Nortel has filed an economic lawsuit against Google, Samsung, and Huawei in the case.
Thousands of former Nortel patent-owned groups on Thursday filed multiple patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone makers, which it smuggled into Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Association, which had purchased Norethal patents at 4.5 billion, has filed a patent infringement case in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., H.T.C. Corporation, Huawei, and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
The prosecution said these patents also include the technology that combines words searched on the Internet with words matched with advertising, which is the main part of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is a tough competition from Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google eventually proposed a $4.4 billion bid, increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons Motorola had to have a long list of patents.
The prosecution said, "Despite losing in an attempt to acquire patents-in-suite in the auction, Google has violated, and is constantly violating."
Rockstar has demanded increased compensation against Google, as it allegedly claims that Google's infringement of patents is malicious.
He believed in the first freely elected president in Egypt.
Mohammad Morsi has taken his oath of office, but his Victory Day hardly ended the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi pledged "new Egypt" while taking oath as the first independently elected president of the country to replace Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago.
On his formal inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the Arab world's first independently elected Islamist president, and Egypt's fifth president after the abolition of the dynasty nearly 60 years ago.
He took oath in front of 18 judges of the court, black-skinned, on his chair, on the banks of the Nile River, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During a formal ceremony broadcast live on national television, Morsi said, "We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic."
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has gone through 84 years as an illegally declared organization since its founding, and which has been under the direction of previous governments, is a U.S.-trained engineer, Sasha Kumar of the party and 60-year-old Morsi of the U.S. - said, "Today, the people of Egypt
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and arrived at Morsi in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Since the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new president, separated from the ambivalence of the President. Traffic was also stopped for a short time, so that the convoy of their motor has moved from the normally busy subway to the city of Dodge, adding
After his victory, Morsi's personal reputation as a non-Krishmay of the Brotherhood, ridiculed as "empty tyre", increased considerably and his speech on Friday made him not only Islamist but also a candidate of all those who submitted Kushta Kumar as a 2011 candidate.
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi took oath of office in front of the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying that "Egypt today is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
After that, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural address.
The military band played the national tune and officially welcomed them as they stood in the currency of caution.
Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was also present.
On their arrival, hundreds of people in the lecture room at the main university there welcomed with the slogan that "the army and the people are one hand."
Established as a fortress of secular education in 1908, the University of Cairo later became a fortress of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath at Tehrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorship last year, and the removal of the leader from his post by the military council last year.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court instead of taking the Parliament-capable oath, they bowed to the will of the army, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech at Tehrir Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases the US spy has crossed the line.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been persecuted under the Intelligence Surveillance Program.
This confession of Kerry came to light while addressing the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London via video link.

Meanwhile, an important committee of the U.S. Parliament has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Its aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust in the people that has been hurt by the revelation of massive phone tapes.
The move has been welcomed by six U.S. companies, including Google and Yahoo.
The NSA has also drilled data centers for these companies.
The Governing Committee of the Senate on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill [FISA] by 4 votes against 11 on the NSA.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including bans on single-use phone tape under the U.S. Patriots Act.
The use of the data will be considered a crime by knowingly collecting unauthorised data under the FISA and for this a prison sentence of ten years has been provided.
The bill will become law after passing both the House of Representatives and the Senate in both houses of Congress.
"""The NSA's phone recording programme is under the law and I believe it has made an important contribution to the security of the country,"" said the committee chairman and senator Diane Festin."
However, there should be more transparency in this regard.
Not only that, the privacy of the public must also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, the disclosure of NSA's Internet Surveillance Program has been backed by angry Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook.
In a letter to the senators, these companies have said that we welcome the proposal of the MPs who are keen on recording the phones of the NSA on a large scale.
It is noteworthy that former CIA employee Edward Snowden removed the veil from the documents issued by the NSA.
The international community is deeply upset after the NSA revealed the oversight of talks over the telephone of presidents of 35 countries, including Germany and France.

A recent media report said the NSA had flown information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for espionage.
The Washington Post has disclosed the matter on the basis of documents obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA was the name-muscular of the program, which it ran in conjunction with its British counterpart, the GCHQ.
Both agencies have stolen data passing through the massive fiber optic cable network laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post said, citing a top secret document dated January 9, 2013, that more than 18 crore documents were collected in just three days after the launch of the program.
These include email, text, audio and video messaging.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the U.S. and an anonymous telecommunication provider helped the NSA access this information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run the program outside the U.S., as court orders are required for such campaigns in the U.S.
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied these allegations during a press conference in Washington, D.C. - as far as I know, this has never happened.
The NSA has always collected all information within the scope of the law.
The NSA had recently become the target of the German Chancellor's espionage.

Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British history after 1914.
The exam will also include "unseen text" to encourage more reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be completed.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take a separate G.C.S.E. in language, and will be very inspiring to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of which will be the first subjects in which there will be revolutionary change.
It will also change in other major topics next year.
In a separate step, the exams will show the changes taking place in the structure of the GCSE with off-season regulations, new grading systems, and short courses.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gov had said that "there was a lot of consensus that, in order to restore the trust of the people, we need to improve our own examination system," he said, adding that the GCS will be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies have found that English schools devote less time in mathematics - 116 hours or less in a year - than most countries do 3 hours less in a week during sessions.
By comparison, Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours per year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While, there would be no formal requirement to give more time to mathematics, the coalition sources said that the broader G.C.S.E.-League table of mathematics was likely to encourage additional teaching in schools by being combined with subjects for greater weight.
This course will focus more on "real-world problems" including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court has refused to halt media reporting.
The Supreme Court said it cannot tell the media not to report on the information obtained from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said that Asaram is being called Drakula in the case.
There is a guideline for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many more treatments that you can use.
Asaram's lawyer said there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are especially two channels that make them more troublesome.
These people are damsing their image and are reporting unilaterally.
In this case, the right of Asaram should be protected.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies that he could use.
In the questioning of the opposition on the railway gate, Pawan Bansal put the opposition in a place saying that he has not looked at anyone's wife in 15 years.
After all this, everyone was surprised at where the woman's story came from.
Perhaps Bansal's gesture was on the side of a big BJP leader and one MP's domestic relations.
Turning the case to the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had plotted to lay a woman behind him during the last parliamentary election, which failed to succeed.
Speaking to reporters, Bansal said the CBI had questioned him about the railway bribe.
If they had been made a witness in the case, would they have been made only after the full investigation?
Bansal said he had written a letter to only one needy person in the booth scam he is talking about.
If this is their sin, they will be guilty of it forever.
While he did not have the constitutional right to raise the issue in the corporate chamber, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said the opposition would be given a list of 15 years of development work as far as the development work is concerned.
The way Chandigarh is developing or is going to be, these people can't even think about it.
At the meeting of the Cabinet, an exchange of greetings was held between the two.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for the retaliatory attack on Narendra Modi at the Chintan camp.
He also said about his speech that he has no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges must be tackled responsibly.
It was the same sentiment on the face of the Chief Minister that he took Singh's speech in a positive way.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to pay respects to the workers at the Chintan camp and to protect them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, they were also told that they are also ready for dismissal from the cabinet to keep their word.
By the way, there is a new outlook in the matter of placing workers in government posts after the opinion emerged in the Thought Camp.
At the camp, state JD(U) president Vashishth Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers in 20 Sutri committees would be announced soon.
It was also a sign that the list was almost ready.
It is reported that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will now evaluate the list from his own level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of MLAs has been taken into account in making the list.
If necessary, the list will be changed on a large scale to accommodate older and committed workers.
The MLAs have been accused of not taking their views into account in making the list of nominees.
The names of those who came much later from other parties have been included in the list while several important activists active since the days of the Samta Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal by their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
In such personalities a name also comes from S. Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, was born on December 28, 1932, at a school in a small village of Chorwad in Gujarat.
Dhirubhai ranked third among five brothers and sisters.
The five sons of the family include Ramnikalal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to the financial hardship, Dhirubhai had to leave school only after high school.
Dhirubhai began to provide financial help to the household in childhood.
At this time they were setting up a bhaji shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Speaking of Dhirubhai's first job, he arrived in the Yemeni city of Eden in 1949, at the age of 17, on a ship called Kabota.
Here his older brother Ramnikal had made arrangements for him, so he had no problem finding a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 they returned to Watanabe.
In 1955, he reached Mumbai with a fortune of Rs 500 in his pocket.
This is where his business journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such a step that he never looked back again.
His name became known not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At the time, he was the owner of Rs 62,000 crore.
His sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are currently under his command.
Like Father today, the names of these two brothers are also numbered among international businessmen.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

The proposal for tax increases will be put before the Cabinet soon.
The government, struggling with the financial crisis, has been looking for every possible way to increase earnings these days.
The Resource Committee, chaired by the Minister of Urban Development Mohammad Azam Khan, has remained in charge of improving the financial health of the government.

Jagran Bureau, Srinagar: Former Congress MP Ghulam Hasan Khan's security has allegedly been removed by police.
Khan held the state government accountable for this, saying his security has been removed for political reasons.
Ghulam Hasan Khan Mufti Mufti Saeed, who won the 2002 PDP election on the ticket of the year from Shopian, was in his cabinet while being chief minister.
Ghulam Hasan Khan said that I have received security armor since 1996.
"I live in shops that call them 'terrorist forts'.
A security shaft of the CRPF was deployed at my home under the direction of the Sub Inspector.
I also have bodyguards with me, but all of my security was suddenly withdrawn on Virwar.
When the security axis was leaving my house, I spoke to the deputy district commissioner and the district SP.
But instead of restoring security, he just said he would investigate the case.
However, when contacted with IGP Abdul Gani Mir of Kashmir in this regard, he denied the information of the case and said that this is a sensitive case.
I will examine for myself how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has finally been removed.
"""Professor Saifuddin Soj, Chief Minister of the state Congress, said, """"There is nothing like this in my information."""
It is a very serious matter if Hasan Khan has been compromised with security.
I am currently in Jammu and Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the relevant administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore over the past four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Rather, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the tenure of the NDA (between 1999 and 2004) Atal Vihari Bajpayee's tenure as prime minister, no ads were issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
While laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182-metre-high Statue of Unity statue in Gujarat's Kevadia on Thursday, Modi said, "Before that, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's Jayantis.
While the DAVP records show that UPA spent Rs 4.10 crore in 2009-10, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's ads.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari was asked about Modis claims, he said that the BJP did not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA did not get any advertising on Patel in the year 2008.
Tiwari said this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's ads each year is significantly less than the amount spent on Nehru-Gandhi family members' jeans and guests.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawahar Lal Nehru.
When Manish Tiwari was asked about the difference, he said, "It should not be seen in terms of spending on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the advertisement or things like the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it reveals our dedication, which people who oppose have been trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without even knowing about it.
He will meet with the families of those killed in the rally in Patna on Sunday.

Moving on from soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well is providing free health care in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not too many doctors in West African countries; there is only one doctor for 5,000 people
Give your vote here or give it via mobile.
Dr. Georges Well is one of CNN's top 10 heroes in 2013.
You can vote for them or for someone in the top 10 to become the CNN hero of the year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father wake up and unconscious, going to the hospital, who was not adequately equipped to help him.
Jamal Well was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon in 1981.
Initially, his only arm was broken, but an infection grew that spread to his brain, and he built blood vessels, which affected his rest of life.
"There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon," says Georges Well.
If we had money, we would take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well kept running over crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and getting whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5 a.m. hoping to be the first person to get to the hospital, but that doesn’t happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people can wait for death to come to their mouths.
The situation has not changed much since Well's father's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In comparison, the United States has one physician for every 413 individuals.
And even if there are doctors there, many of Cameroon's residents can't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in healthcare in the country is in the private sector.
Well says, "The only problem is poverty."
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his compatriots, Well made a firm determination to solve some of it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have done 700 free surgical treatments last year.
He also became a therapist himself, and began working as a vascular surgeon at Yonde's Center Hospital.
And he started the non-profit organization Escoweem, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped about 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and up to 30 people sit in the van, tie medical supplies from the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes luck doesn't even happen with them.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and soil more than once.
But when they arrive, they get truly heroic honors: festivities, singing and dancing, and the best housing that can be offered by the community.
Free medical services in these villages are really a reason to celebrate, and Well - with its big smile and endless energy - includes happiness-happiness.
The next morning, his team begins to meet hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We're meeting 500 people on every trip."
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All of these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a bathrobe, donated glasses or free birth certificate -- this document is required in school but many poor families can't afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical treatment with local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done at school buildings, town halls or at home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery site, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generators publish in the operating room and sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers get up and work on Sunday mornings.
It's a slow pace, but the village musicians usually help keep the band motivated.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - which includes Cameroonian physicians and foreign medical students - have undergone 700 free surgical treatments last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One person said he would be able to go back to work due to receiving free hernia surgery.
He said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in a hospital, Well also works in a private medical clinic around Yonde at night.
He said that this is his second job which finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is filled with private donations.
Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Well's group, said, "I don't know when they're sleeping."
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
For students of medicine and nursing such as O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity that they can never get in their country.
"In gynaecological medicine, we have been able to gain experimental experience in helping Dr. Well grasp tools or clean up blood stains," O'Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in the United States, you will never get the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students usually spend from near themselves to reach Cameroon, and they often come with donation medical supplies.
But after arriving in Yundi, they come to live, and take up the expenses of instructions well.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
It's not that much of a burden on the job.
Helping others live happy lives, fulfilling the promises made to their father, these are the things that give them so much joy.
Well says, "I am very happy when I do this work."
And I think about my father.
I hope they’ll see what I’m doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

You won't believe it, but it's true.
Not only that, Mission Road has been named after Anjali Kumari, the city's president.

Addressing a rally, Modi said, "If you look at the speeches of Congress or U.S. leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they are not talking about what they have done."
"Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer media questions,"" he said."
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he should have a reply from Modi.
It is your duty to respond to the people.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibal who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants a controlled environment where he gives his speech and does not talk to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to face-to-face debate.
"I promise to the people of the country that when the BJP government is formed in 2014, we will report to the people every year,"" Modi said."

Obama's health care proposal has been withdrawn.
Amid a shower of criticism, President Obama took back his often-repeated misleading promise yesterday that "you can continue it if you like your health plan."
As well as receiving cancellation information from their providers by millions of people, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading American citizens in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "many people who have health insurance, and it's useful, they can continue it."
Speaking about what he calls a "news blast," Obama has given the grace to buy new coverage in the market from U.S. citizens receiving these information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, just as much money or a comprehensive health care plan inexpensively.
"""You'll get a better deal."
The administration has said that it should come as no surprise that 5 per cent of the population who purchase insurance with their own money may be obliged to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the desired standards under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement to the Home Energy and Commerce Committee in Wansington, Sebelius said, "I tell these American citizens directly, 'You deserve better than that.'"
Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has been "unfortunate" since October.
"I'm just as disappointed and angry as other people," he said.
I want to regain your faith.
Sebelius, sitting behind him at the House hearing yesterday after a tight nocturne with the Republicans, said the sentence in anger, which a Mike caught. Billy Long, R-Mo about whether they would need to be nominated in Obamacare.
In a more than three-hour long-running hearing, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare Dot Gov.

As a result, there has now been a reduction in cases of violation of the Code of Conduct.
Since the Election Code of Conduct came into force on October 4, 313 cases were registered against various political parties till October 21.
Only 31 cases were registered between October 22 and October 27.
With the implementation of the Election Code of Conduct, there were also cases of violations.
There have been more complaints in the early days, but Ahista-Ahista has begun to decline.
It is reported that in the early days there were more complaints against political parties due to lack of full knowledge of the code of conduct.
There are now fewer complaints on the part of the Election Commission due to raising awareness among political parties and taking lessons from the registered case.
Many parties were campaigning as before in the absence of information, but when action was taken against them, they stopped it.
The political parties are pursuing it with information about the Election Code of Conduct.
This also reduces the number of cases of violations.
In this regard, a proposal has been sent to the government on behalf of the ADA, which will soon be sealed.
Surrounded by three sides of the Ganga-Yamuna, this historic city no longer has a plot on which the ADA could make a large residential plan.
In this way, he has now made plans to move eastwards from Zhansi, northwards from Fafamu and southwards from Naini.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of District Magistrate Rajshekhar to give a broader form to the plan.
The ADA has come up with the idea of incorporating two hundred revenue villages of Phulpur, Soraon and Karchhna.
After the ADA's border, the chakra and brave block will end.
At the same time, half of the block will be merged into the ADA.

In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said the U.S. spy "has gone too far inappropriately."
John Kerry has pointed to the US's protective attitude towards his surveillance program by unintentionally admitting that sometimes his spying "goes too far inappropriately."
The state minister has also admitted that he is also guilty with Barack Obama in the case of being a "automated pilot" in rebellion against informant Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities.
This secretary-general has given the U.S. government diplomatic grounding in its relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at a Free Government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, me, and other people in the government really knew about some of the things that would happen with an automated pilot, because looking back, the events in this form were World War II, and the definite years of the Cold War, the difficult years of the Cold War.
He has become the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. spy has extended its borders, but has stressed that no one's rights have been abused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify this for the people and is currently conducting in-depth reviews so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that nothing is going wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed that, however, the NSA was an effort for good cause, and its monitoring work has saved the lives of many people.
"We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up,"" he added."
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to blowing people up and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We have actually saved the plane from falling, buildings falling down, and people being killed because we are able to know in advance about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that U.S. lawmakers will visit Europe to assist in resolving concerns abroad about so-called U.S. spying, and will require European countries to understand the need to jointly address corruption with the U.S.
Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about the threats of him being banned from participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to the clutches of surveillance by the National Security Agency.
In an interview with Washington, Murphy, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee of the Democratic Party and first elected to the European Parliament, said, "It is really important for the U.S. national security interests that Europe be in the context of our counter-terrorism efforts."
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue to work together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
News of recording millions of phone conversations in Europe by the NSA has brought bitterness in relations with some of the U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said that these news are not entirely true, and that the United Nations has colluded with the NATO allies Daesh and Malayalam.
Other revelations in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that the NSA has conducted cell phone monitorings of 34 other top leaders in the world, including German Chancellor Agenela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper called it necessary, defending the incident of spying on allied countries and said that it is common for both sides to do so.
In the midst of the uprising, Murphy said that his office is arranging a congressional visit that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped that both parties and members of both chambers would be included in the deputy board.
The names of the other lawmakers who will be participating will be released in the coming days.
He said work is still underway on the travel plan.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said that some "impractical relations" would also have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders will have to be honest with their people, even with their spy programs that have been used for years.
"Although we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of the European people, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
During this time, Mr. Carrie's program is to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend, where he will resolve hatred over U.S. surveillance activities in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
A new policy to change boards in municipalities has been initiated.
Recently, Trinamool was transformed into a board due to changes in the Congress-led board of MPs in Sanithia Municipality in Virbhum district.
The conversion took place due to the participation of the majority of Congress MPs in the Trinamool, including the chairman of the Municipality.
Not only the Congress but some MPs from the MKP, BKP and Farward Bloc have also repressed Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Rai sees this as a good sign for the party.
Congress president Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta have joined the 10-member Trinamool constituency, he said.
Some left-wing MPs, including the MKP, have also held the Trinamool flag.
All have written to the district magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of Trinamool and, according to the number force, the Sanithia Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool.
Shri Rai also claims that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee all agrees with the plan of development of Bengal which has been decided.
Leaders of other parties, including the Congress, the MCP, the BJP, and the Forward Block, are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
"Welcome to the trinity of qualified leaders of any party.
Due to the change in the party of Congress MPs in Sanitia Municipality ahead of the election of five municipalities on November 22, the occupation of Trinamool on the municipal board is being considered important in political circles.
Earlier, the Left-Morocco-ruled Haldia and Nadia are examples of the possession of Trinamool on the Congress-ruled Municipal Board.
When Trinamool is occupied on the municipal board in the districts due to the change of party, those who join the party are greeted with a big welcome at Trinamool Bhavan, Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Rai is excited to join the trinamool of leaders by breaking with other parties.
"Welcome to the Trinamool of those who break up from any party,"" he said."
He claims that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's leadership has increased the faith of the people, which has resulted in people wanting to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party, the Makpa, says lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress in fear of terror.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is considered to be a trauma to the MCP democracy.
While any party has the right to increase its population in a democratic way, it is imperative to question the justification for not changing the subject of power.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Thai Detention Period
A 21-year-old woman in Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days imprisonment for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assault, she has appealed against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, the Fuket Provincial Court found Steve Rossell Bombford guilty of making false accusations against Thai police, alleging that a local taxi driver had tried to stop him along with two other people on Sunday morning.
But later on, CCTV footage revealed that she had safely returned to the hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
When interrogated by the Fuckett police for two days by Bamfort, he admitted to making up his story.
He was placed in a local police custody prior to the hearing in the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in a low security detention centre in the outer area of the hut instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has applied to the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family is "extremely worried" about his daughter's care and they want to call her back to Australia.
Tunks said, "It has undoubtedly been a worrying time for us, but we hope he will be back home soon."
Bambood has appealed against the penalty order, and bail has been granted on 50,000 bail.
A report in Australia said she was celebrating holidays at a place celebrating Krabi's holiday in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said the Bamford case was being argued by a local lawyer in a fuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend his sentence to two years and force him to remain in adult detention.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Fuket, Thailand could also give acquittal in an effort to improve its poor tourist image.
