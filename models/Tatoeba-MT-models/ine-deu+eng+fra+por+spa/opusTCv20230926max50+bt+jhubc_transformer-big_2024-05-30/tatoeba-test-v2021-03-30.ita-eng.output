He was the first to help her.
Are the kids already asleep?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom was not very active.
We cleared the road from the snow yesterday.
I'm not busy at all right now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe he should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Come on, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he had done.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at the University of Hyogo.
We will participate in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went on without problems.
Nobody wants to help us.
They speak very quickly.

It's from Sweden.
He had no money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?

Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We had a good time.
It's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom was angry.
I'm old already.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English at a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us some funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What is your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.

Tom needs to eat.
Everybody, get out of here.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say things like that.
From bad to worse!

You did well here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He interfered in his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom is still absent.
I ate all the apple.
Roast the bhakri while the pot is heated.

We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.

Stop beckoning.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
Would you like to eat with us?

Can you write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why are you trying to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I got him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to become more active.
Are Tom and Mary joking?
She broke the smoke.
I have no alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
She's smarter than him.
What will you do this summer?
He got annoyed.
Do you speak Shanghainese?
He narrowed down because I washed him.

Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.

This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What is your favorite female rapper?
Say hi tom for me.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why is he leaving so soon?
I'm pretty proud of it.

Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who is the man playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his income on drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.

The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?

I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love to be right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot if he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50,000 for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry up.
Tom hates it.
I rarely do it almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a warm summer evening.
I always walk.
It's crucial.
You're not a lot of fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the car keys.
I don't really want to talk.
So he must be Argentinian.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more cautious.
She's shocked.
He should have done it yesterday.
I am a huge fan of American cuisine.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.

Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drum.
It must be hot.

Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Take care of your tongue.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want to take this?

They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?

Why does he hate Tom so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.

My shoes got wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you going to leave me?

He's an expert with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Is it going to be warm again tomorrow?
