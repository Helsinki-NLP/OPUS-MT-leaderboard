Father Józef Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's charismatic.
The masses are drawn to the Masses he has celebrated for liberation and healing.
He was a few years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscans, others are experiencing this.
Crowds gather for Masses of Liberation and Healing celebrated by Father Witko
Once came to him the parents of a 7-month-old child, who had a hole in the heart of the size of 7.5 mm.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
The same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Surprised, the doctors said: “Operation is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm.”
My parents were crying for happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The clergyman began to experience the extraordinary work of the Creator as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was awake at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.
“My body has started to change.
I lost my human qualities and began to take on the appearance of an animal,” he says.
An invisible force lifted him up, he could not get a voice out of himself.
He felt that he was lost.
Then God showed him the way to salvation.
“I was immersed in the waters of a river symbolizing the baptism of the Holy One, I was released and returned to human form,” he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
His vocation matured in him.
He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he did not just talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
In the Masses of healing celebrated by Father Witko participates many people who are counting on getting rid of the disease.
However, the clergy emphasize that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical.
The first failure of Kolping FRAC Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw
Today (September 26th) the team of Kolping FRAC merited the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superliga of Table Tennis.
Jaros<0xC5><0x82>awians in such a personal list, as they presented with the Grodzisztans, have little chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
This was shown by a duel with Darth Bogoria.
The team is still missing, summoned to the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the composition of Jaros<0xC5><0x82>awian would have reached the third successive triumph in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han is probably not yet ready to win with dozens like the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, that is, Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellady was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Both in the fight with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was class alone.
After three duels Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an emotional, five-hundred-year-old fight – Pavel Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give her a chance.
We could have hoped to win by two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.
There will be no further research for seniors.
Why is that?
According to Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski, a program of free prophylactic studies for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
The idea will not be implemented, however, because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
In the reasoning, the agency explained that the target group was poorly selected.
"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening the difficulty in accessing the benefits of NFZ and adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive result," the study said.
The decision of the department is not understood by the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, the money is ours.
Only the government is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because it is about leading to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that this helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand,” said Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski.
“I find it hard to imagine the current specialists saying, ‘Let’s not worry, because there will be longer queues at the doctor’s office, and if such specialists are advising the government, it’s no wonder that the health service is in such a state,’” he added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all agreements so far
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday at a session of the UN General Assembly that he would break any agreements concluded with Israel if the future government of the country tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel, which will be raised, proceeds to implement this plan, we will nullify all the agreements signed and withdraw from all commitments made," he said.
"We will completely and completely reject the whole plan," Abbas said.
“It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – regardless of the consequences – by fully committing ourselves to the application of international law and to the fight against terrorism,” he said in a statement.
Netanyahu, the former prime minister of Israel, was once again given the task of forming a government after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he wins, he will announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intends to incorporate into Israel all Jewish settlements across the West Bank.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
Abbas, 84, also promised to hold a general election on Palestinian soil during the UN General Assembly session.
The last one took place in 2006.
“After returning to the country, I have called local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” he said.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, which is regarded as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the powers conferred on “full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations with all due respect.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas’s speech, saying the Palestinian leader “would rather focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority’s efforts against Israel than fight the calls for terrorism in the Autonomy under his leadership.”
Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu’s announced annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators in the neuralgic points of Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l
The history of the border crossing shows that the automatic defibrillator AED can save a human life.
The Voivodeship Emergency Rescue Station in Przemysl wants such devices to be located in the neuralgic points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Voivodeship Emergency Station in Przemysl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Tax Office in Przemysl.
On August 28, they were serving at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyce. A Customs and Treasury Officer noticed an unconscious man lying in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist has died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
A communist party secretary from her home village called Cao Shuxia, the activist’s wife, on September 23, to inform that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not reveal.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body slaughtered, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in his blood,” she says.
“They wouldn’t let me take my cell phones with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn’t get close to Wang.”
The police pressed to sign a statement that the husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an "unfortunate accident".
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Center for Research and Development
Nearly PLN 105 million in co-financing will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the 3rd edition of the GameINN program.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, the project was developed with the help of the company’s 4th model – the development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine, which creates a map of the real world together with an application that allows the transmission of data by users; the test and training platform for the verification of practical skills.
The aim of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game producers sector on the global market in the perspective of 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and the already PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs within the framework of this sectoral programme represent an important impetus for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev,” the statement reads.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“The government’s incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R&D leverage, competency enhancement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by NCBR, drive innovative businesses and allow them to compete more effectively in the highly competitive marketplace, according to the minister.
The head of the Department of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of deducted R&D costs amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in savings of more than PLN 300 million for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by NCBR in the three editions of GameINN,” stresses the Deputy Prime Minister.
NCBR Director Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki recalls that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the III competition and the variety of submissions show that the video game industry has the ideas and competencies to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“It is particularly gratifying that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects for solutions that are not only for entertainment but also related to Industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third competition GameINN for funding of up to PLN 20 million could apply entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was 100 million PLN, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost 105 million PLN of co-financing.
Detailed information about the results of the III GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented as part of the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confesses to stealing Kasper Dolberg’s watch
The incident occurred on September 16th.
Dolberg, who arrived at the end of August from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the wardrobe.
It’s not worth it, it’s worth 70,000 euros.
An angry Dane did not show up the next day for classes, explaining his stomach problems.
It was a mystery from the beginning.
The players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club ground is monitored.
According to AFP, he finally confessed to the theft to Diaby-Fadiga.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the money for the watch to the Danes.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young footballers in France.
He came to Nice at the age of thirteen to make his debut in the first team three years later.
He has played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as reported by the newspaper L’Equipe – the club is likely to terminate it with immediate effect.
So far, he has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. when you come home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
And most of us do it for a shorter period.
Warm water and regular soap are enough – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even discourage them).
By washing, we rub not only the underside and tops of the hands, but also: fingertips (joined or single) – rub them with circular motions on the inside of the other hand, the spaces between the fingers (wrap your hands and rub your fingers on each other), thumbs and thumbs – we embrace each thumb in the other.
In an emergency (when you can not wash your hands), we should wipe your hands with a wet wipe, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drug stores, from 5 PLN).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the handle or door with your washed hands (recommendation of the General Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper towel.
Iranian President Says He Rejected Proposal for US Talks, Donald Trump Denies
Tehran did not engage in talks with the U.S. side during the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite the U.S. offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree with.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the US has proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It should regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rouhani: Iran will not hold talks in atmosphere of maximum pressure
The Iranian president said he did not agree to take the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He said he had met with U.S. diplomats because he succumbed to the temptations of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran will not engage in talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure”.
“Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5+1 format, no one is able to predict what the end result will be,” Rouhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the US, and he accused the European parties of favouring US sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal “are a precondition that does not allow” for dialogue.
“If we can lift this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to such a conversation last week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump tweeted that he rejected the request from the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said ‘no!’,” the US president tweeted.
Tensions with the nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran to somehow save the 2015 deal with Iran, which they were signatories to.
It stipulated that in exchange for lifting economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program, and the nuclear sector would be subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in May 2015, its signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the deal in place.
So far, none of this has worked.
Washington is using tactics to exert maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a raw material export permit, every 60 days it will limit its commitments resulting from the agreement.

The judge of the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the heiter Emilie, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp, participated in the stalking of the judges, were returned to court by the NSA on Wednesday.
Reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, so there is no reason to uphold the order of WSC President Wojciech Mazura to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into a proceeding against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must deal with the decision of the WSA’s president within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly spoke about the mental problems of his wife in order to discredit her, who was removed from the office of the KRS due to suspicion of participation in the heirloom group, will return to judgement and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the Hejter group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except for fake screens and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorced.
Exactly the same is said by the other judges associated with the “Cast”: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it is quite possible that they will bet on their own.
Because the prosecution has not wavered its finger to secure the evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of the phone Emilie Szmydt, who stopped this phone in June in another case.
The police did not wave their fingers to secure the devices of the people, whom he pointed out as persecutors in a February report by Judge Waldemar <0xC5><0xBD>urek.
There is no evidence – there is no case of Szmydt, there is no case of “Casta”.
There is also no case of the head of NIK Marian Banasi about renting the house to supporters and hiding the income.
The CBA checks his statements of assets.
And he'll check when he does.
And the Ethics Committee of Posel will not deal with Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee of State Control has somehow gathered to make a curious decision about the abrogation of Banasia’s deputies and the appointment as his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novelist, an American novelist, I think, about how her wife comes home and finds her husband with her lover in bed.
She's so stunned and devastated she can't shake a word.
She is standing at the door nodding, and during this time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, dresses herself and goes out.
And my husband was sewing the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and screams: what is it?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what woman, dear?
Only the case of “Casta” or Banasia is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Li<0xC4><0x87>winko in the final jump up
Earlier this season, returning to the competition after the pause of the mother, the bronze medalist of the 2017 World Championships in London, in the first try defeated 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
1.94 was achieved only in the third approach.
“I’m glad.
I showed that I can fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I will have to jump better technically,” Li<0xC4><0x87>winko said in front of the Eurosport camera.
In the eliminations, American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karina Demidik – after 1.94.
The two players were the only ones who didn’t fall at all.
The women's final is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7:30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in a serious condition
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is considered severe by doctors.
It must be added that he is conscious and aware.
“We believe it will come out that he will win again.
We are all praying for him to recover,” said Kornel Morawiecki, an anonymous close friend of the group, in an interview with reporters at the Super Express.
In the upcoming election, the prime minister's father runs for the Senate.
“My closest family and politician keep me alive,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave to the Super Express journalists two weeks ago.
In January, “Super Express” reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been sent to the Military Hospital in Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw for testing.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I went to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
“When I was tested with a computer tomography scanner, I was found to have pancreatic cancer,” the prime minister’s father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me, and I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't have any metastases.
I still don’t know if I’m going to have chemotherapy.
I give myself into the hands of doctors specialists who are rather good at thinking.
For now, after this heavy operation, I need to get back to some sort of usability.
I hope everything is going to be okay," Kornel Morawiecki said in a conversation with SE in January.
“If I were too late, the situation would be tragic and I would say goodbye to this parachute,” he added.
Cracow: 14-Year-Old Missing
Officials from the Municipal Police Command in Krakow are looking for a 14-year-old Nel Stoklosy.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is requested to contact us.
The missing woman left her home on the evening of September 26 and so far has not returned or made contact with her loved ones.
The last time she was seen was at Stary Go<0xC5><0x9B>ciniec Street in Krakow.
Nel Stoklosa is 14 years old, measures 167 cm, has blond hair and gray-blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a blouse, grey pants and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is requested to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of o<0xC5><0x82>awski jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon September 15 at the hippodrome on Oleandra Street in O<0xC5><0x82>aw, can be misleading for some.
The road to true power is far from over, but this is what is called one of the types of horse competition...
The competition of jumping power consists in overcoming by the rider and horse the ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed up to two meters.
It is worth adding here that the long-standing and still undefeated world record, established in 1949 by the Chilean Alberto Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in O<0xC5><0x82>aw, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is also not among the worst...
The competitions organized by the untiring Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the saddle” were a showcase part of the recently played there “The Rainbow Riding Competitions”, about which we write more widely in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons started the competition, training riding in the O<0xC5><0x82>awski JKS.
Four of them competed on cocks and four on big horses.
In the first group was best Nikola Szo<0xC5><0x82>dra, who got to the crazy “Sprinter”.
This small but dynamic rumak started by overcoming the obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with an upper beam distant from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was he pushed away from further competition by the jury of the competition.
The second place in puppet jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who reached "Famy", and the third by Lena Boru<0xC5><0x84> on "Harmider".
Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the little stallion "Carmen".
Even greater emotions accompanied the start-up Amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Threat-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, who received the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was on the “Flight”.
Fortunately, besides small cuts, neither the Amazons nor the horses did anything wrong, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz had a lot of problems with introducing the young stallion "Wineta" to the park.
She needed either a trainer's assistant or another pair of horses, followed by a little crazy "Wineta".
After counting the obstacles from the parkour, she also slid down in full glory, so sometimes in boxes and at the stretcher it was dangerous. "Everything is under control!", Jan Sienkiewicz reassured some of the frightened spectators, especially the youngest.
Since the beginning of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska has been writing well on the parkour, getting to the beautifully presented “Whisky”.
This decent bat, coupled with an experienced Amazonian, jumped 135 cm first in the second approach in the final phase and this was the best result at the time of the competition.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk on the “Declaration”, Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz on the “Winete” and Anastasija Abramenko on the “Lotce” also added the same amount.
For the decoration of the flood and after receiving prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these contestants went together, and at the end, together with the Amazons on the ankles in the rhythm of the Radecki march, they performed an impressive honor round, ending with this interesting and exciting challenge.
THANK YOU
The Equestrian Sports Club "W Siodle" would like to thank the sponsors of the jumping power competition during the XVI "Artificial Equestrian Vocations": the City Office in O<0xC5><0x82>aw, the Water and Sewerage Plant in O<0xC5><0x82>aw, the District District and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko cuts off from KWW Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution
KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Pavel Kukiz, but none of these coalitions happened, and KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko himself was not even able to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any district.
Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has completed cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect from w/w KWW the deletion of my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to associate my person with the aforementioned entity," he added, announcing that more information will be provided soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his action or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on American Independence Day, US journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has been famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and the world.
“We’re tired of politicians, tired of your stupid games, tired of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the state to take over the nation and govern for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said.
The program of the party included, among other things, issues related to the judiciary (should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalization of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance for the eastern NATO countries, with special attention to the transfer of the Polish state into the referendum).
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation Mariusz Max Kolonko started talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted a message on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
None of these coalitions, however, eventually came about.
UBS: Gold close to equilibrium
“The price of the euro will remain around the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak conjuncture in global markets,” said Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"Expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilizing the gold prices at the current ceiling," the specialist assesses in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not opt for rate hikes in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.
“As long as the gold is properly valued – euro quotes should remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months – Polish bonds are not attractive enough.
Significantly more favorable yields than Polish securities offer bonds from emerging markets,” said Michael Bolliger, Head of Asset Allocation for Emerging Markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
“The global slowdown may deepen, but there should not be a severe recession, or at most a decline in GDP dynamics slightly below zero,” said Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should be wary of global actions that could be hurt by the lack of prospects for a U.S.-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should be the relatively weakest," according to a recent letter to investors from UBS Wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.
“Eurozone stocks should behave worse than US stocks because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown,” the document reads.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the longer term, the long-term yields of papers should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, due to the easing of banks’ monetary policies.
The Fed has the biggest footprint for a rate cut, which is expected to weaken the U.S. currency over the next few years.
The long-term equilibrium point for the euro is the $1.29 cap, which would mean a 19 percent potential to strengthen the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed rates, which will result in a reduction in differences in monetary policy around the world.
“The long-term strength of the dollar may not allow for a current and budget deficit,” Bolliger said.
The Bundeswehr loses its weapons.
Confidential Report of the German Mon
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 ammunition – according to a confidential list made in the defence resort of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The news was reported by the media group Redaktionsnetz Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the parliamentary secretary of state at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3,474 pieces of ammunition have so far been recovered.
Among the military equipment still missing are: six universal MG machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 luf are missing for MG3 machine guns.
The Left Party’s vice-chairman, Martina Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
As she told RND reporters, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “terrifying.”
All the more so that as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as a “poor balance sheet”.
She also criticized the fact that the list does not show whether there is also a weapon that was found during the investigation against the Lieutenant of the Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist motives.
His “black list” of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor’s office, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Greens and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally took possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying children on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently used a feature designed for people for whom traveling with a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the layout of seats on the plane.
If a minor travels to the second year of age, the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by the parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the option of choosing a place far away from that occupied by the child.
The BBC reported that the airlines had already reported the shortcomings of this solution.
The “Children’s Icon” will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if the flight has been changed at the last minute.
As you might expect, the idea was shared by the Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we used to be.
“We need to learn tolerance because we will soon need a map of seats for breathing mouths, salivating or drunken people,” Sundar wrote.
Another internet user noticed that he was once harassed by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a lack of support for the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me of the screaming children during the 13-hour journey,” Ahmed wrote.
Majorca counts losses after bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come to Mallorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by travel agency Thomas Cook.
According to the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands, Marc Pons, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected holidaymakers who, due to the bankruptcy of the British company, had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month are citizens of Germany and the Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island during November-April, losses to the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the government of the Balearic Islands has already begun negotiations with international operators on the "entry into the market of Majorca" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The newspaper Diario de Mallorca estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are fired from Thomas Cook’s office in Palm Beach.
Others will lose their jobs mainly in the hospitality sector.
On Monday, along with the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook in many Majorca hotels, the property owners demanded that guests pay an extra nightly fee.
This situation was experienced, among others, by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The government of the Balearic Islands estimates that by Thursday several dozen hotels in Majorca had suspended operations at least until the end of October in connection with the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook and his cooperating companies.
On Friday, the Diario de Ibiza reported that most of the hotels in Ibiza that worked with the Thomas Cook Group did not intend to close in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British bankruptcy co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would seek support from the Spanish government in the amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most injured tourists on this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
According to data from the Government of the Balearic Islands, Thomas Cook relies on local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts covering the period July-September 2019.
FIFA Women's Ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA at the forefront
Poland’s women’s national team ranks 29th in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Mi<0xC5><0x82>osz St<0xC4><0x99>pi<0xC5><0x84>ski was classified in the previous July list.
Poor match-ups.
How will it be in October?
The leaders were the Americans, who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, while the third place was held by the Dutch.
The Poles are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were supposed to start the away game with the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting, due to food poisoning of the opponents, it was postponed by a year.
In this situation, the Poles will inaugurate the qualifications with a meeting with the Spaniards on November 12 in Lublin.
Earlier, the "White-Red" will play two friendly matches - on October 3 on the departure with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group of rivals Polek are the national teams of Spain, Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three teams from the second place advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the barrages for the last three passes to the European Championships.
The 16-participant bet will be supplemented by the host – England.
The men's national team of Poland in the September FIFA rankings fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog stifled the government
“The effects of the Clean Air program are negligible, and the coal furnaces will climb this winter as if nothing ever happened,” reads the first page of today’s Rzeczpospolita.
“Until now, 82 thousand applications for funding have been submitted under the Clean Air programme with a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
Accepted proposals amount to more than PLN 915 million in total," Rz said, citing data from the Environment Minister's spokesman.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The results of the announced noisy program the journal rated as "modest".
The self-government, quoted by “Rz”, has seen the failures of “Clean Air”, among other things, in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic filing, sending invoices by mail, possible random control of implementation.
This would make things better,” says Lidzbarka Warmi<0xC5><0x84>ski’s mayor Jacek Wi<0xC5><0x9B>niowski.
Activists from the Polish Smogogowe Alarm note that in the first year of the operation, less than 1% of the projected goal of replacing 3 million hiking boilers was achieved.
As Rz notes, although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion annually, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for the Protection of the Environment and the Water Economy for this year, PLN 1.4 billion was suddenly reserved,” reads the report.
Congress approves F-35 for Poland
B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but not the end of our work,” B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price,” the Polish minister added.
Agreement on Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force is targeting 32 F-35 Lightning II fighter jets produced by Lockheed Martin Group.
In mid-September, the U.S. State Department approved their sale to Poland.
The statement stressed that the investment will support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of NATO’s ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for the fighter jets.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics and program support and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35
The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat and single-engine fifth-generation multi-purpose fighter.
The aircraft is capable of performing close support missions, bombings and typically fighter air combat missions.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
The F-35 fighter jets were recently purchased by Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16 with them.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also considering the purchase of U.S. fighter jets.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Producer Barbie has launched a series of sex-neutral dolls.
He wants to fight stereotypes.
Producer Barbie has launched a series of sex-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the series "Creable World" wear wigs.
Therefore, children can decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys from girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different leather colours and with different clothing.
Gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and a slim waist or, in the case of Ken, wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have imposed gender norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that gender-specific toys inhibit girls’ ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” says Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “unhealthy female stereotypes,” such as unnatural body proportions.
The company has responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls of different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: club or club Together may have several members
When Zandberg was asked on ZET radio how many candidates of his party could get into the Sejm from the list of leftist groups (the KW SLD from which the list starts the candidates for the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo "Left"), he replied that it depends on the result.
“I believe that the Left’s result will be very good, because we feel that people have hope that the Left is not only right but also strong,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left can have 60-80 members.
“This may mean that the club or the club together will have a dozen members.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I will not guess and tell you how it will happen,” he said.
Asked if Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that by being different, we were able to agree on a common program.”
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is SLD leader W<0xC5><0x82>odzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are center-left and left-wing voters.
On the other hand, to note that the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he replied that “the goal of the political party is to represent its constituents”.
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
In the Senate election, he said he was considering it.
“The offer is varied and there are candidates and candidates in this offer to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is closer,” he said.
"I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in the 44th Senate district, I would take an electoral certificate and vote in another district," he said.
“I don’t think I would be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski,” he added.
Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS start in this district outside Ujazdowski.
Dakar: Biggest Mosque in West Africa Opens
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built, which could accommodate 30,000 worshippers.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, part of the Sufi current of Islam that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a six-hectare wet area handed over by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan Mosque ("The Path to Paradise") comes from the title of the poem of Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, a 19th-century founder of the fraternity, revered by followers as a saint.
The mosque is lined with carrary marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque inside can accommodate 15,000 worshippers, and the second one can be on the outer esplanade.
In richly finished interiors, you can admire the golden dome, giant chandeliers and handmade decorations by Moroccan workers.
Builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the buildings are still unmatched to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to land, funded lighting, sanitation and road works worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.5 million.
Coach Smy<0xC5><0x82>a: Our problem is not Silesia, only ourselves
A pass of eight league matches without a win, the players of the Crown will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-chairman of the extra-class <0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>ski.
“Our problem is not Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw, only ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” said Kielce coach Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Smy<0xC5><0x82>a.
The Korona players last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first row, when they defeated 1-0 Benjamin of the competition Raków Cz<0xC4><0x99>stochowa.
Later, Kiel<0xC4><0x8D>anje recorded two draws and six losses, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zag<0xC4><0x99>bie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup game the players fought for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the masonry after the last whistle did not result from the collapse, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close," Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
As he noted, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why he will be sensitive to the team to play in the side sectors of the field.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play,” the coach added.
In Friday's match in the Crown will certainly not play pausing for the excess yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, in the frame will also be missing injured Jakub <0xC5><0xBB>ubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
It’s interesting to see a few players in the game with a desire to play.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed that it would not be there, and now it is,” Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the pass of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the extra-class anyone can win against anyone.
“We are a good team.
We may not show it on the pitch in recent weeks, but there will come a time when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday."
After nine extra-class rounds, the Crown with five points ranks 15th.
<0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>sk has accumulated 12 more and is placed in second place.
Friday's match in Kielce will start at 8:30 p.m.
These trees could disappear completely from Europe.
“42 per cent of the tree species on Europe’s coast are endangered,” the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned in the Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnut trees and squirrels.
The IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was prepared by experts who, based on research, concluded that 42% of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) are “highly endangered”.
Among the reasons, the Red Book lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As for typical European trees, according to IUCN experts, 58 percent of species are endangered, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of trees, accelerated urbanization, too intensive tree cutting, and then forest fires and changes taking place in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, moss and seedlings is also at serious risk.
“The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual extinction of European plant species and create a risk of extinction in Europe of important and undervalued varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet,” said Luc Bas, head of the IUCN European Bureau.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I don't promise 600+
“Today PiS wants to bribe the Poles, offering them for their freedom to give credit, which will have to pay off future generations,” says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.
In his opinion, “the whole policy of PiS is a pic”.
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken”.
In a conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz, Schetyna assures that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the polls.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this regard than Kaczynski’s party.
“Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of PiS, a party that has disloyalty to proclaimed values such as modesty, humility, transparency,” Schetyna says.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic assumptions of the KO electoral program.
“First, nothing of the data will be received, but it is necessary to set the direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, as can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “starting up the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably – and those who are entrepreneurial.”
Schetyna explains that the KO program included, among other things, a project that would give the least-earning Poles more than PLN 614 per hand, and the most-earning Poles – also after several hundred.
The politician also said he did not want to run for office.
As he said, he’ll do as much as he can, but he doesn’t promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the governments were bidding with the opposition on the publishing house, until finally there was a financial collapse of the country," he said.
In an interview with Rz, Schetyna also stated that Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“We would exacerbate their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“Pride moves before the fall.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski is such a man of the state as Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is crystalline,” he added.
The PO leader also said he had not yet decided whether to apply for the platform’s presidency.
Argentina: Six Condors of the Great Dead
Six large condors have been found dead in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, according to TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Large condors have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators such as cougars, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals may have eaten a toxic leaf.
In addition to one young specimen, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“This is a big loss for the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species,” said Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentinian environmental organization.
“I think the use of toxic bait and poison is endangering not only this species, but all other life forms, including human health,” he added.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on granting the head of state a valuable chain.
The idea was supported by the law firm of Andrzej Duda – we read in “Rzeczpospolitaj”.
As the newspaper explains, it is the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called the interwar jewel of the Republic of Poland.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mo<0xC5><0x9B>cicki.
"Rz" indicates that soon such a chain can hit on the arms of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and the Petitions voted on Wednesday to work on the amendment of the Law on Orders and Awards in order to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate proposed this amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.
This time the work is flashy.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, acknowledging that they would seek the opinion of the President’s Office.
This one came in mid-September.
“I kindly inform you that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in the petition,” wrote then-Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the matter and again devoted little time to the matter.
“The President’s office has responded briefly: it is in favour of restoring it,” PiS commission chief Robert Mamamov said.
He made a request for legislative work, which the committee supported.
The police will teach the drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski and al. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski.
Uniform actions have something to do with recent complaints by the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive activities in Rzeszów "Crossing Crossings".
It is about eliminating traffic obstacles: driving at the intersection without the possibility of descent, not applying to traffic lights or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we are making life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobi<0xC5><0x84>ski, vice president of the city.
His words resonated at a press conference of the town hall, at which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars after intersections, which in turn creates traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers for sanity on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not to write SMS while driving.
The topic was somewhat taken over by the Rzeszow police officers, who are starting the action "Crossing Crossings" from today.
What's the matter? What's the matter?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of limitation of transit at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a common offense that contributes to the strengthening of traffic jams and the formation of traffic jams.
It is threatened with a mandate of PLN 300 and 2 penal points.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic lights or road signs and improper parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe a lack of driving fluidity, late movement under the traffic lights, slow crossings and leaving too long distances between vehicles.
What intersections will be used?
Among others, on Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiello<0xC5><0x84>ska Street; Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>skiego Street from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudskiego Street; Targowa Street from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudskiego Street; <0xC5><0x9A>reniawitów Square from D<0xC4><0x85>browskiego Street; and Hetma<0xC5><0x84>ska Street from Warsaw Uprisings.
This type of action in the capital of Podkarpacia will be held on the next Friday of October.
They checked the waste disposal company from "Czajki"
“Officials of the Environmental Protection Department of the Precinct of Volomi<0xC5><0x84>ski County and the District Inspectorate of the Construction Supervisory on Friday inspected the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, in which waste from the waste treatment plant “Czajka” in Karzho<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>skie in Warsaw,” said the star.
Inspectors from the Volominski district conducted an inspection at the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
The Private Trade-Transport Plant “Dar-Trans”, under the agreement with the capital’s sewage treatment plant “Czajka”, performs waste management services.
“The installation was inspected and the entrepreneur was also asked to provide documentation related to his activity,” Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report will be forwarded, among other things, to the Voivodeship Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last inspection in “Dar-Trans” was carried out by the Voivodship Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw between December 29, 2015 and February 11, 2016.
It was then determined that the company did not take samples, measurements and tests of groundwater, and also did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal sewage sewage from the “Czajka” wastewater treatment plant.
After the inspection of WIO<0xC5><0x9A> Dariusz Sobota was called to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies collecting waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sewage from the “Czajka” treatment plant.
In accordance with the decision to carry out waste disposal on the site of the plant, waste with a weight of up to 60,000 tons per year is processed in the forests around Greenland.
The Warsaw City Water and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, STUOS was shut down from operation, which was related to the damage of one of the combustion plants.
As MPWiK reported, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa supported Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
"You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support," Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa told Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska on Friday.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me,” said the candidate of the Citizens’ Coalition to the prime minister, leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, it is now “only a supporter of retirement”.
Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska met on Friday with former President Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa in his office at the Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk European Solidarity Centre.
A short conversation behind closed doors was also attended by Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa’s son – Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
“You have taken on a difficult task,” he said after the meeting with Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, there is great hope that you as a woman will cope with these problems, and we all – those who love Poland – will support your actions to the maximum,” the former president said, addressing Kidaw-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska thanked him for his support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the Constitution and knows how important it is,” she said.
“Let’s show that we can do another, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” said Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Kibic in retirement
Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa, speaking to journalists, said he is now “only a supporter of retirement”.
“Of course I look at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, tested, (to this) we will return.
The tripartite power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are the most necessary.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all this needs to be restored to normal functioning, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we have a street criterion," said Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa.
“That is why it is so important that the Poles go to the elections, think about it and make their own decisions.
And that’s the most important thing,” Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska added.
"The last chance that we will improve the situation in Poland with a letter," the former president replied.
“We need to rebuild the foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said: “Mr. President said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If the tripartite power does not exist, if the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move forward.”
ME Volleyball: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-finals.
On the hot ground in Ljubljana, Polish volleyballers fought the Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no shortage of controversy and discussion with the judges, with Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
The White-Reds lost 1:3 and will play for a bronze medal.
The Senate has decided on the key laws.
The Senate passed without amendments the law on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important persons in the state.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the Family Wealth Act, with no amendments, 14 opposed and three abstained.
At the same time, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the debate on Wednesday by Senator PO S<0xC5><0x82>awomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to “civilize” and limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the property situation of their own children, the children of the spouse, children adapted to cases in which the children remain in a common household with the person obliged to make a statement.
The law on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important state officials, the draft of which was created in the Prime Minister’s office, was passed by the Sejm on September 11.
The rules presuppose that, among others, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Chief Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons who are at the head of other state institutions will be obliged to place the persons in the statement of assets and property.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important persons in the state.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the state.
The law also clarifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
With no amendments, 55 senators voted for the bill, 12 opposed it, and four abstained.
According to the law, every flight of the president will be a flight “performed in an official mission”.
In flights, the President will be able to be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the President.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will only be "performed in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function performed".
The law also specifies a list of people who can accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation – invited MPs, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational support; and journalists can be on board the aircraft.
In accordance with the law, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for an explanation.
If such doubts are not clarified in due time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or the Senate of the impossibility of organizing such a flight.

The Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyballers held their first training on Friday in Paris, where they will play in the match for the bronze medal on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's underdog closed the way to defeat the title Thursday's 1:3 defeat with the Slovenes in Ljubljana.
There was a lot of talk about their troubles with the trip to the duel.
This time it went well without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenes on a charter to Paris, and a few hours later they trained in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the reports of the people present at the classes, the trainer of the world champions was nervous.
As Heynen’s assistant Micha<0xC5><0x82> Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the mere practice of volleyball elements.
“We went to the gym, but for the most part it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to earth.
Without two words, we are disappointed.
We always thought we would come back to this game.
We discussed this game with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point out ineffectiveness in attack and far worse than usual dealing with situational balls.
Slovenians were much better than us in this respect,” he said.
According to him, the "White-Red" did not stand in the way of stress, related to the performance against the loud and numerous audience-supported co-hosts of the tournament.
He admitted that the world champions could sleep a little smooth way to the semi-finals.
“Maybe if we had a similar failure in the group stage, we would have analyzed the lesson more quickly and then we would have played in the next stage of the tournament.
But that’s only if it’s hurrying,” he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday’s loss to the Poles will be turned into aggression in the match for the bronze.
“I hope that we can show our true face.
There's something to fight for.
The last time we won a medal was in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two matches of the group stage, and moved to Ljubljana in the semi-finals.
Nick Kyrgios: Severe Punishment, but in Suspension
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine – in a six-year suspension – for abusive words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour players are losing patience with Kyrgios, but they are still giving him a chance to improve.
The summary of the offenses of the most undefined professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks break plus a heavy fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a trial period in which a stubborn athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he’s been doing it for a long time and has set his own tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the court and next to it.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Chachanov – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113,000 dollars.
He also did not play for long at the 2019 US Open, but managed to publicly say that the ATP activists were “corrupted”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they initiated a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the said verdict on the suspension of the starts and another fine.
Words about corruption, however, were forgiven, after listening to the accused and knowing the context of the speech.
In the justification, however, the tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’ behavior over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, that he was constantly abusing people associated with tournaments in a vulgar way.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering the fulfillment within the next six months of several conditions: in the tournaments ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can not violate the rules of the code of conduct in any way.
He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people who specialize in solving the problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios’ first comment on the verdict was: “Hey everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that’s all.”
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as his elbow injury has worsened in the Lavera Cup, so he had to give up the upcoming starts in Beijing (September 30 – October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).
In the ranking ATP Kyrgios takes 27th place.
This year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $ 1.3 million, so even after fines, he has a lot left.
GUS: In Poland we are living better and better
According to a report published by GUS on Friday on household budgets, 44 percent of households assessed their material situation as good or rather good.
The previous year this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 it was 33.5%, and earlier – since 2009, when the Statistical Office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households of self-employed people.
In this group, more than 70 percent of respondents consider it good or rather good.
On the second pole are the households of Rentists, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also greatly influenced by the number of children.
The worst case scenario is for single-parent parents, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good financial situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 per cent, and among childless households it is 48.8 per cent.
The effect of the 500+ programme is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016) their worst material situation was assessed by single parents raising offspring and multi-child families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear correlation at the level of the provinces between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are made by residents of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
The Lubuskie (47.7%), the Silesian (47.6%), the Mazovian (47.3%) and the Western Pomeranian (47.1%) voivodships are also present.
Meanwhile, in Opolskie, the disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average in Poland and 98% in Lubuskie.
The highest incomes were Mazovian (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%).
On average, in Poland, the disposable income per person amounted to PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjusting for the effect of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
In the past few years, the score is quite low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also inhibits spending growth.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, per capita spending actually increased by 1.9%, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Research on household budgets suggests that statistical households now spend 70.1 percent of their disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80 percent and by 2006 it exceeded 90 percent.

Paulina Smaszc-Kursaevska appeared in the closed show of the Italian brand “Patricia Pepe”.
Natasza Urbanska, Katarzyna Figura and Beata Chmielowska Olech were also selected for the event.
A camera show could not have taken place without a wall on which the stars boasted of their styling.
Unfortunately, the photojournalists caught Paulina Smaszc-Kursajewska’s blatant mistake.
The woman wore a white stand under a black shirt, which made her feel strongly.
U.S.: Three suicides among aircraft crew
Three sailors committed suicide aboard the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the U.S. Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of the ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of the events occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush moored off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
In addition, death is not supposed to be related to each other.
“Everyone needs to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to stress that there is no stigma or other repercussions associated with seeking help,” said Captain Sean Bailey, the ship’s commander, on Facebook.
He is critical of the pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In a conversation with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“In fact, every sentence was accepted.”
There was criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activities of Rydzyk places a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – the pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media at its best in the life of the Polish Pope,” he explained.
“There were eclipses of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had power and could simply throw him out of the Church for politics or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do it, as did his successors,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski explained.
In addition, this fatal case of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, in fact, their absence, has occurred.
I ran a little forward, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole shape of his life.
We know about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.
The question arises, how is it possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things,” he said in an interview with journalist Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski.
According to the former PO politician, the Polish Church is an ally of the PiS.
“It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, crosses hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are Pisov, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the Pisov regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will have to pay an elephant,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski said.
"I hope that Pope Francis will pursue J<0xC4><0x99>draszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this kind," he said.
HRUBIESZ<0xC3><0x93>W: Tomorrow the 590th anniversary of the county

PZPN spills punishments for burdy in stadiums.
Disqualified graph
The fight in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk with a small hair did not end tragically when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic, passed by the fans of the Wejherova race by millimetres.
After this incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
Investigating the case, the PZPN commission imposed a harsh punishment on Gryff, excluding him from future competitions.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed into the next match at their own stadium.
They will also not be able to leave for league matches until December 31.
Burdy at the Widzewa <0xC5><0x81>ód<0xC5><0xBA> stadium also caused fans of Silesia Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Here, however, PZPN’s judgment was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities on this issue.
Despite this, the services allowed the <0xC5><0x81>ód<0xC5><0xBA> fan sector to be ducked, the chairs lit and the host sector forced.
The game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the upcoming match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and another edition of PP.
The ban also included the Ekstraklasa league matches, but it will last until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange markings across the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In the Podkarpaty region, the implementation of the new regulations of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, the registration of the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, "Lions" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our Voivodeship, changes will be made to 94 road signs located on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it is meant to be easier, easier to read and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of localities in neighbouring countries often also have a Polish wording.
Thanks to the changes in the law we have prepared, they will finally appear on the road signs along our roads.
The introduction of a new marking starts from the sub-carpathian section of the A4 motorway," said Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
At Podkarpaci, changes will be made to 94 road signs located on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total cost of investment?
200,000 z<0xC5><0x82>.
First of all, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is scheduled for 1 November 2019.
What should the implementation of the idea look like?
It will happen without exchange of plates, on the principle of adhesives.
They will replace the current names of the towns with new ones, written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, then in the original, in parentheses.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan out of a windmill
In the pond in Zamecze in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed a swan having problems with its wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had arranged a target for the animal – a jet from a windmill was found in his body.
“Information about the wounded bird was received from the villagers of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in Nova Sali.
It was reported that the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately apparent that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately so as not to hurt him or expose him to extra stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the veterinarian.
After the first X-ray, it was already known that someone had made a bullet shield from it.
His body had jet fragments,” says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages the rehabilitation center, among other things.
It's cold in the center.
"The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water was provided, a safe place in the center where he will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He's not able to fly yet.
Letting him go now would mean that he probably wouldn’t survive the winter,” Walasek adds.
After the swan has undergone rehabilitation, the staff intends to release it in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the municipality of <0xC5><0xBB>ukowice, after receiving information about the cause of the animal’s poor health, intend to inform the public prosecutor’s office about the case.
The incident took place in Zameczny
Gowin: “we must stimulate Polish, small-scale trade”
"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, the leader of the Agreement Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin.
During a conversation in "Signals of the Day" on the radio station Yedynka, Gowin stated that trade is dominated by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually grow.
Noting that this problem is very difficult to combat, the deputy prime minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term, but received "a counter on the part of the EC".
“We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates a government, we will come back to this issue,” he said.
At the same time, he noted that “effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade”.
“Beyond this, it will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in acknowledging that the Polish retail tax was an unauthorised public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act envisaged the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8 per cent of revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4 per cent of revenue above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to be in force from September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission opened proceedings for Poland’s violation of EU law.
Brussels argued at the time that the design of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It then stated that the tax had been enforced unlawfully.
It also issued an order to suspend the tax until it was analysed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court paved the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not finish the case.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the CJEU press services told PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure will start, i.e. hearing the parties and possible hearing.
It takes a good few to a dozen months for an appeal to be filed.
“Such proceedings take an average of a year,” a PAP source told the Luxembourg Court of Justice.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer a number of practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.
It is often the first time that the whole family focuses on the child, celebrating together his appearance in the world.
No wonder, then, that the freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best on that day.
However, before you make the final decision about your child’s outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In stores, you can find many mechanical kits that do not provide the child with proper comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a baptismal garment is the age of the child
Until recently, several weeks old babies were baptized, arranged in white sets and inserted into the same barrels or big stumps.
Today, children approaching the sacrament are often older: several months old, annual, and even larger.
It is not difficult to guess that such a great consolation needs a little different clothing for baptism.
Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he or she will probably spend the celebration in a stroller, either at the hands of parents or godparents.
The best option will therefore be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered a everyday outfit, it is enough to look for its sacred variants, for example, with a waistcoat or lace.
For the boy, the perfect pair of jerseys will be printed with fleas and heels.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have more fantasy in clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a straight, tulle dress
Many parents of girls look with anguish at richly decorated, wavy dresses for baptism complete with coats, belts and caps.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials for their product, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
If you are looking for the right clothing, it is better to check out the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, applications and charming sets will make your little girl look gorgeous and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a small gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of the boys, there was fashion for suits that were a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or caps often caused young elegance to loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been washed out by comfortable, cotton kits.
Just take a look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft jersey pants, and also the blouse decorated on the front on the pattern of the vest.
These dresses look extremely sacred, and at the same time do not hinder the movements of the child's knowledge of the world.
Krystyna Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz published a statement of assets
Krystyna Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz filed an estate statement at the end of her term.
It turns out that the PiS member collected PLN 110,000 of savings.
Let us remember that Pawlowicz announced his resignation from politics.
At the end of his term of office, he has an amount of PLN 110,000.
According to the statement made by the member, she receives a monthly pension of PLN 4,7 thousand.
Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz has an apartment worth PLN 570 thousand and a little smaller, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, valuation of the investment at PLN 150,000.
Earlier, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski also published a statement of assets.
Voting on a break in the debates during the Conservative Party conference
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day pause in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual program conference, which the government has asked for.
There were 289 votes in favour and 306 against.
Normally, the House of Commons does not take part in party conferences, so that members do not have to give up their participation in them or the meetings of parliament.
However, opposition parties have agreed that at such a crucial time as the last few weeks before the UK’s planned October 31 exit from the European Union, the parliament should not interrupt the talks.
At the request of the government for a pause, 289 MPs voted, against 306.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The lack of consent for the break can be seen as political revenge of the opposition to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was ruled illegal and unprecedented by the Supreme Court) and for not wanting to retaliate after the judges' verdict.
Following this decision, the House of Commons resumed the session on Wednesday, with Johnson’s speech and the tumultuous debate following it being the most important event of the day.
Johnson has accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“The time has come to implement Brexit.
It needs to be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.
“Brexit must come so that we can deal with the citizens’ priorities, with health care, with the cost of living.
“Brexit must be achieved so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to begin in Manchester on Sunday and run until Wednesday, October 2.
The conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the reasons given by Johnson to explain the long suspension of parliament was precisely the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a response to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” writes the foreign media.
The president's spokesman strongly denied these reports.
“It’s just not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>e Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, write that during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the consulate in New York, Andrzej Duda stated that Israel is to blame for the latest anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a response to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, who stated in February that “the Poles sucked anti-Semitism with mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating remarks made by its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted, “Polak, Polak”.
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
That’s just not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel is responsible for the latest anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”
According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it".
According to JI, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, the Commander of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda’s words and say that the Jews of Israel “like Israel Kac” are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to the Boteach portal, he was to interrupt Mosberg's statement.
Who is Banas and what did he do?
The house rented by the tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in the estate statements of Marian Banasia.
Let's summarize another affair that shocked the ruling camp.
TVN’s “Supervisor” journalists revealed that Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B>, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has in recent years not enrolled in the statement of the estate of a 400-metre-long house, which is located in the Kraków Podgórze Mountains.
What’s more, his sub-tenant was supposed to run a sex business in that house (so renting rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself was supposedly a collateral for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel in the program “Supervisor” drew attention to the irregularities.
The reporter revealed that the house was rented from Banasia by people connected to the criminal world to use it as a place for "erotic meetings".
The clients were supposed to be men using the services of prostitutes.
To the accusations, Bana<0xC5><0x9F> responded vaguely and vaguely.
Interestingly, the house rented by the tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in the estate statements of Banasia.
The house itself was described vaguely in them, and the income from its rental was to be understated.
“The estate of Mariana Banasia and his wife can be worth between PLN 6 and 8 million.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]”, writes Money.pl.
And as it turns out from the analysis of the portal, the Banasia house itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently auditing Mariana Banasia’s statements of assets for the years 2015-2019.
Bana<0xC5><0x9F> announced that until its completion, he will suspend his activities in the NIK. “I will go to your marshal for a free vacation,” he assured.
The opposition demands clarification.
“We do not hear the CBA expand its investigation or speed up the investigation of Marian Banasia’s estate statements.
Therefore, we are forced to hand over the state authorities and submit a notice about the possibility of committing a crime [...]", - said PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
“If a normal Pole had so badly valued the rent of his property, he would already have 10 checks, a tax scale and criminal-tax proceedings,” he added.
He went up high, he went down low
Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is the new president of the Supreme Control Chamber.
He was appointed to this position on August 30, 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was announced by Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party were accepted.
Previously, Bana<0xC5><0x9B> was associated with the NIC between 1992 and 2005. He worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
During the first governments of the PiS (2005-2008), Bana<0xC5><0x9F> served as the President of the Customs Service and also the Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
From 2015 he again sat on the chair of the Head of the Customs Service, and from 2017 he managed the National Tax Administration.
Bana<0xC5><0xA1> served for 3 months as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the order of the policeman will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding a warrant for certain behavior issued by a police officer is intended to be a new kind of offence, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.
The police unions want such a change.
The idea came to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million criminal cases are brought before the Polish courts,” it reads.
Rzeczpospolita has determined that the petition that the Independent Union of Policemen writes to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance of success.
The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It should read: "Whoever does not obey the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, shall be subject to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."
“Paragraph 3 of this provision provides for an identical penalty for those who, failing to carry out orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of a service,” the newspaper said.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told “Rzeczpospolita” that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal of the regulation, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political manifestations.
“In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be unfavourable and instead of easing the situation, it would even be exacerbated,” he adds.
According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
I've got a lot of writing in my blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today mentioned in a single line with Václav Havel.
From the very beginning, therefore, the curse of talent, which he tries to exploit, lay upon Jáchym.
After eight years, he returned with the "Sensitive Man".
The heroes are Buras and So<0xC5><0x88>a along with their two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They are wandering actors, traveling around Europe.
He's a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys did not make a sound from birth, and for the second time stopped in infancy.
But it is not the heroes that are the most important in this story.
They are all just a backdrop for observing a world where there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It is a world of busy provinces, a society of old, suspicious people, and lustful youth.
"Sensitive man" places turns into an absurd theatrical.
The narrative imitates didaskalia, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of fears about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Brussels Airlines Cancels 105 Flights Due to Thomas Cook Bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is operating.
However, the company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All office trips that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also declared bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased by Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company is now “fully operational” despite a bankruptcy announcement by a British parent company that has caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then reassured that customers who bought tours in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest and largest travel agency, went bankrupt on Sunday night.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of the last chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors demanded that in addition to the <0xC2><0xA3>900 million rescue plan already agreed in August, the company obtain an additional <0xC2><0xA3>200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have increased for several years, resulting in a debt of <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.

“I don’t think Slovenia played fantastically.
We played very poorly.
This tournament is not over for us yet,” said the captain of the Polish volleyball team Micha<0xC5><0x82> Kubiak after defeating Slovenia 1:3 in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for a review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the arrival of the German Görlitz.
Actions are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel city attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing serious problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also facing a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them fled to the west, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city’s population.
In 2013, it reached 54,000 people.
Wanting to fight the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the programme.
Two-thirds of them were made up by residents of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the program.
“When we applied, we thought the program was meant to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel it doesn’t matter if we stay here after four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has 7,000 vacant homes and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get the views of the program participants.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild, head of the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a pay program for promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
