China strongly opposes U.S. adoption of Taiwan Bill
China strongly opposes the U.S. adoption of the so-called Taiwan Bill, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Sino-American Joint Communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The U.S. Senate’s approval of the bill is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and gross interference in China’s internal affairs, Ma Xiaoguan said.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues relate to China’s internal affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the corresponding negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to the Sino-American relationship, as well as peace and stability in Taiwan,” he said.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, Ma Xiaoguan said.
TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
Take a look at China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok has censored videos mentioning Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian said.
According to the documents, the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) uses the app to promote China’s foreign policy goals abroad.
Most of the violations related to China’s policy fall under the “incitement of hatred.”
In each case, TikTok places unpleasant posts in a context appropriate to the general rules so that the actions of the social network do not appear to be censorship.
For example, a ban on criticism of China’s socialist system falls under a general ban on “criticism or attacks on the politics and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under “the distortion of the history of China or other countries.”
The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen" of Vido Preko, including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-un and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, U.S. presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, and the presidents of the United States.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Posts from the first category are deleted by social network administrators and may result in a user being blocked.
Not too severe violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applicable: “We are now using a localized approach for moderation, as well as attracting independent local specialists.”
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says the co-founder of the "Producer Center" Rustem Bogdanov.
“Producer Center” is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All promotional materials of bloggers "Producer Center" agrees with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without consent, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether TikTok can talk about politics or Putin, Bogdanov says he has seen such publications.
Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Didgital, agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for users TikTok lists in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content, discriminatory statements and so on."
But under these rules, you can summarize any content that moderators do not like, notes Zaripov.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian TikTok partner.
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only people over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Administrators of the social network check their age with artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork coworking.

Russians have been warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters who replace the phone number of the bank has increased.
This is reported by Kommersant with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator passed information to the telecommunications operators about more than 2,500 numbers, from which customers of various financial organizations were called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a replacement number.
A further 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases the use of financial services was restricted.
The deputy head of the information security department of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks faced with the replacement of the number.
He explained that operators do not always respond to the Central Bank’s warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the Communications Act.
At the Opening Bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank confirmed the information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with the replacement of the number.
According to the Biline press service, part of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank gave was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to failures in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudster numbers, which the telecommunications operator will contact with each call to check the number.
He explained that such a basis would require amendments to the legislation.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine’s membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
This is what the secretary-general said during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Asked whether the topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they really discussed the issue, and also stressed that in his answer did not mention the dates of Ukraine's accession to NATO.
According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance is obliged to meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, writes RT.
In Crimea, Zelensky proposed an alternative course in NATO
President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, instead of the course to join NATO, should be engaged in establishing good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
On Friday, September 27, the Co-Chairman of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegrinets, announced this.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [U.S. President] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinets told RIA Novosti.
Cegrinets noted that Zelenskyy is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, to remain in power the Ukrainian president will succeed only in the case of establishing relations with the Russian Federation.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he had a conversation with Zelensky on the country’s accession to the alliance.
According to him, for this, Ukraine is obliged to fulfill certain conditions.
On June 5, Yevgeny Balitsky, a member of the parliament, said that Ukraine’s possible entry into the alliance does not guarantee the improvement of life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is blackmailing Neymar.
Spain's Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the move of the striker to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost reached the court, but the Catalans proposed to the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of Themida.
Otherwise, they refuse to return to him.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also a Brazilian agent, had an interesting trick: under an agreement with Barça, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, a year later, the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Not only that, the Brazilian lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest for late payment.
When it became known in the capital of Catalonia about the claims of Neymar, "Barcelona" filed a counterclaim.
The Blue Grenade insists that the bonus was assumed for the performance of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was only charged a quarter of 40 million euros and demands the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barça almost agreed on the return of the "fornicated" player in the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal has failed, but the hope for the forward’s reverse transition remains.
And so, reports Sports.Ru with reference to insiders, lawyers of the club told representatives of the player that if the question of financial claims will not be settled in the pre-trial procedure, it will exclude the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Neymar himself is so eager to return that he has asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

At the same time, the Reform Party wanted to replace Jaanus Tamkivi with Andres Sutti in the council.
But Laar responded that the aim of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that, in addition to Yaanus Tamkivi, Andres Sutti would also be on the board.
On Tuesday, September 24, Riigikogu rejected Laar’s proposal to appoint new members of the Bank of Estonia’s board.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a truck found in a garbage pile
A resident of the American city of Auckland Park, Florida, has been arrested on charges of attempted murder after swinging a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a truck found in the garbage.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging in a pile of rubbish near an empty house.
This was noticed by the evening walk of Todd Beavers.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black truck among the trash.
Miller saw Beaver's finding and was upset.
He thought he could claim the truck, since he was the first to dig in the garbage.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly, Beaver grabbed the truck and ran with it to his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he had found in the same pile and began to chase the opponent.
He picked up Beaver near his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knife and started waving it in the direction of the thief of the truck.
Beavers told Miller that the incident was being recorded in the video.
After noticing the camera, Miller ran away, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the truck in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw that a strange woman entered his yard and took the truck, shouting insults.
The police have already searched for Miller for driving a car without a license.
The man was arrested and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked a strange woman and wounded her with a sword.
Thus he reacted to the fact that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated in the same hotel where he stayed, did not allow him to smoke.
Mass riots in three
The “Moscow case” against the participants of the summer protests the further, the more noticeably it disintegrates into individual fragments and loses political fill.
Evidence of the fact of the "mass riots" does not withstand verification, but in the absence of a political decision to put this case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it will surely leave in the extreme irritation of the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining indictees under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexei Minajlo was suddenly released from detention without any obligations, and after a few hours and completely rehabilitated: the SCR removed from him the charges.
Minajlo has been under arrest for almost two months, several professional communities joined him at once: historians, priests, writers.
After this, there were only two accused in the case of participation in the mass riots (originally accused were 13): Sergey Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Rajabov, who was on the eve of the arrest extended until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the authorities).

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens has been poorly studied.
One of the most famous is Pine Pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular disease, some cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all beans (the most popular - soybeans), hops, flaxseeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be a complete replacement for natural hormones.
Possible harm from such supplements cannot be excluded.
For example, against the background of their intake, the production of their own hormones can be reduced due to the fact that too many analogues from the outside enter the body.

Hydrometeorological center called true folk signs
In Russia, there are many folk myths that people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that allegedly work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, though, in the short term.
As the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Wilfand said, if the sun is red during the sunset, then the next day will be really nice, as our ancestors pointed out.
And if the sky is white, it will rain the next day.
The second working feature is based on bird observation.
They often talk about swings, if they fly low, it is usually to the rain.
This is explained simply - when the humidity of the air is high, the wings of the molars are soaked and the birds are forced to lower to hunt insects, writes TASS.
There are people on different continents.
Surka Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day it is necessary to observe the eagle coming out of its pit to determine the time of the arrival of spring.
Unidentified oil spills found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil spills of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The pollutants were scattered over two thousand kilometers of the coastline.
Reports of the first oil spots detected began to arrive on the second of September.
However, every day until Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Environmental Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the identified samples.
It turns out that they are all identical and it is about crude oil.
The state-owned petroleum corporation Petrobras, to which the samples were transferred for analysis, said that they do not correspond in composition to oil extracted from fields in Brazil.
“This is heavy oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And it probably got into the ocean current," said the coordinator of the union of workers of the oil industry of the states of Pernambuco and Paraíba, Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected northeastern states, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environmental Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning up polluted beaches.
Meanwhile, specialists of the institute recommend tourists and locals to bypass oil spots and notify about all detected centers of pollution.

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has instructed Rospotrebnadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Commerce, together with the Business Ombudsman and the business community, to review the sanitary and epidemiological rules and norms for food organizations.
They will also have to study the question of transition to the application in the organization of nutrition of the requirements established by the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union.
The departments should submit their proposals to the government no later than October 15, according to the list of orders of Mr. Medvedev as a result of the September 11 program "Dialogue" on the TV channel "Russia 24".
At the same time, Mr. Medvedev instructed all the aforementioned departments, besides the Ministry of Justice, to provide proposals for conducting an experiment on January 1, 2020, to limit control measures for food organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad region.
The Ministry of Justice and Economy has been instructed to submit to the government until November 11 a draft law with amendments to the CoAP on the application of the administrative suspension of activities for violation of the requirements for the organization of nutrition, due to which damage to health was caused.
In addition, the Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Economy, Rospotrebnadzor and the Ministry of Finance need to work out the question of a gradual transition from 2021 to the formation of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products, allowing to form a full-fledged diet of healthy food.
We will remind, about the outdated norms of requirements the business community spoke after it was closed one cafe from the network "Anderson".
The business community demanded the abolition of the existing SanPin, Rospotrebnadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
There are 33 departments on the list.
Meanwhile, Rospotrebnadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary norms and rules by 40 times by 2021.

Of the two cars - VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107 - the hijacker took battery batteries, presumably, for the purpose of further sale.
"And from another car VAZ-2107 for the same purpose, the attacker took the car magnet and subwoofer," the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Tula region reported.
The intruder probably intended to re-sell.
The 26-year-old is currently unemployed.
Russians have nothing to put off for retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough savings to earn the full force of the bill on a guaranteed pension product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings in the world is quite common.
The other thing is how timely it is for us to introduce it.
"In my opinion, a significant part of the population now has income, from which they simply have nothing to allocate to the increase of pensions in the future," Matvienko said.
The Russians, according to the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms of formation and payment of pensions, because "constant changes in this sphere have finally confused them."
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve the size of pensions, social protection of citizens.
But steps in this direction should be thought out, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," Matvienko said.
If this initiative (the draft law on a guaranteed pension product) is to develop, several basic principles must be provided, including voluntary, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state to ensure the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the sending of a draft law on a guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary procedure of joining citizens to the savings system, guaranteeing the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Illustration rights holder Getty Images Image caption The news of the departure of a favorite superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has provoked anger among many devoted fans
One of the most famous comic book heroes - Spider-Man - will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures were able to agree on the rights to use it in franchise movies.
This was revealed in a Sony press release, which says that the third part of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on the screens on July 16, 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on the sharing of revenue, which is why Spider-Man will leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The rights to the film are owned by Sony.
She rented them for Marvel movies, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenues from movie box offices, and Disney – from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point such a situation ceased to settle Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said he was delighted.
It’s amazing that Spider-Man’s journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
“We at Marvel Studios are all very excited to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a symbolic figure.
It’s a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences around the world,” he said in a statement.
At the same time, Figi recalled that Sony is also creating its own cinema universe, built just around Spider-Man.
“So it happened that he was the only superpowered hero to be in different movie worlds.
So as long as Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may bring unexpected surprises.”
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently, commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an excerpt from the film "Wolf of Wall Street", in which the hero Leonardo di Caprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information about the conflicts between the companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash proceeds from Spider-Man movies, provided both companies would pay half of the costs of producing the paintings.
But that didn’t suit Sony.
News of the possible departure of a favorite superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has provoked anger among many devoted fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
Sony declined to comment on the deal, but said: “We have worked well together over the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together was in line with the wishes of many fans.
We are happy to be able to move forward together.”
Avengers: The Final, which brought Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes together, became the highest-grossing film in the history of world cinema, taking Avatar out of the top spot.

In the Congress, in the conversation of Trump with Zelensky saw a "Russian footprint"
In the lower chamber of the US Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of involvement in the scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.

Next articleExpert Tells Why You Should Give Up Tea in Bags
A team of Canadian scientists representing McGill University found that when a tea bag is brewed, more than ten billion microplastics are released into a cup in five minutes.
Particles of sawdust can also be added to the packaged drink, said Elizabeth Tikhonova, a food safety expert.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add there ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
Sawmills are not thrown out at the end of the season, so they may end up in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to refuse to use such a drink in favor of the suspension tea, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, due to which they can begin to release harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - in such a drink there will be fewer additives," the expert said.

Regions are invited to share the secrets of business support
As the "Parliamentary Gazette" became known, on September 27, the Chairman of the Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy, Andrei Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, and to the Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, with a proposal to express his position on the initiatives of the Federation's supporters for improving the legislation in the region.
It is time to establish inter-regional relations
The Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on the business development and legalization programmes for self-employed persons, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the existing legislation.
"To date, communication between regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit of senators was indicated the issue of lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole", - noted Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a compendium of positive regional findings on the legalization of self-employment and a compendium of regional data with suggestions and issues (available in the editorial board).
In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on the positive developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such an exchange will be the forwarding of information available to the Economic Policy Committee," the senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Today, in many regions of the country, programs of support for small and medium-sized enterprises have been adopted and are operating successfully.
For example, in the Vologda region there is a Support Center for Entrepreneurship, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the principle of a single window through multifunctional centers.

And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be taken out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation in order to support small and medium-sized enterprises more effectively.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "business activity" because it "most corresponds to the content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to make amendments, providing for the expansion of the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including activities for the decoration and repair of residential premises, country houses, physical training classes.
Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control of dishonest dairy producers with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they advocate the establishment in the regulatory and legal field of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the directions of support for social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills," Kutepov said.

Internet users, who use the services of the airline, are delighted with the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One user complained that a few weeks ago he had made a flight from New York to Doha, and there were three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested introducing "flights only for adults", expressing willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that now they will always try to choose for their trips Japan Airlines, because they do not see anything pleasant in flying next to a crying child in an enclosed space.

At the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020, the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited to import into Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official portal of legal information, noted that the validity of the rules has been extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the order to abolish the sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein joined this list, and on January 1, 2016 – Ukraine.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported “sanctions” (products that fell under a food embargo, which Moscow imposed in response to anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government has allowed the destruction of “sanctioned” food by any lawful means.
As Western sanctions continue, Russia has also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, products that citizens import for personal use, this measure does not apply.
The ban does not apply to the importation of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation on the development of civil society and human rights, Mikhail Fedotov, previously called the destruction of food products "simplely immoral", and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, Rospotrebnadzor took the initiative to ban the destruction of foods suitable for consumption at the beginning of June.
After that, a similar recommendation was made to the Government by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Alexei Gordeyev said that it is wrong to destroy food, and it is necessary to think about how you can use them as intended, assessing the quality.

In Chile, began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, the building’s dome, which will house the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), has officially begun construction this week, and is the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
Its total value is estimated by ESO to exceed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion.
Most of this money will be spent on equipment and building the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help the E-ELT to get the first detailed photos of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and to look for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome is only beginning, the mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
