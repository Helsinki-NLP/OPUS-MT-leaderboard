Wales Assembly Members Concerned to "Identify Them as Muppets"
Several members of the Assembly have expressed their consternation at the proposal to amend its title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen from the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a mockery.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said his party was concerned that MWP "remained with Twp or Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the party assembly Plaid Cymru has commented that the whole of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For its part, a Welsh conservative member has claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there is a too small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in English of Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for drawing up the legal draft to introduce the changes of names: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint the members of the assembly will of course fall on the members themselves".
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee opted for "Wales Parliament Members" or "WPM", the "MWP" option was the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
Apparently, members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, attempting to reach a consensus can be quite a curse for the Assembly President, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will hold the final vote on their denomination during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change their country’s name
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor’s name represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country’s attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the change of name is simply the price to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Stop Ringing: The Difficulties of Harlem Churches
“Historically, the old people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is no one left, either."
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing nowadays,” he says.
“The bars have ceased to be that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people went periodically.”
As for churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of assets will not last as long as expected by their leaders "and that sooner or later they will return to where they came from."
Churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will be of no help to the temples remaining in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore what they will do will be to accelerate the closure of all churches, as it is highly unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The White Methodist congregation that was originally there left in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street retailers, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the lane.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly described the lane as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who made the carillon sound in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first lane in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest lane in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded like St. Martin's in recent months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
The council, the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese "intended to pass on the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy While Searching for Lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he made a dive to hunt for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobsters season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on San Diego's KSWB-TV, he spent half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help. Then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was about the joy of having grabbed a lobster, but then "he realized he was screaming 'I've been bitten!
They bit me!"
He had the whole clavicle torn," Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
“Because everyone came out of the water, I shouted, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in serious condition.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that he had been working for a few weeks that a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas due to investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, heading to the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products aisles in the style of large warehouses with specialized employees.
These large aisles are just a part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the UK, a market that moves around <0xC2><0xA3>2800 million and that continues to grow as the fashion and home products sectors lag behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to see if the store grows.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the avidity of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its Boutique makeup product range so that most products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has led to large supermarkets having to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, the stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch groceries sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy products departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's did a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but everything quickly ended up not agreeing on how to share the benefits of the pharmacy chain within supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store business to Celesio, owner of the chain LloydsPharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the look of our beauty products aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help when offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and that challenge the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby backs a deal of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones left "furiously" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby backed a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to dedicate himself to the joint business of Truly household products and accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to be compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones furious at retiring at the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand joint business to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring her great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the blonde television star admitted, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new deals of the presenter, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant that she would no longer have enough accessory time to dedicate to the brand's joint product.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones boarded a private jet heading to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to step back left all the parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow Headquarters ready to be sold.”
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment it had made in products, from cushions and candles to clothing and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined him as president last March.
Both couples spend the holiday together. In addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that “we will not comment on his business.”
“Sometimes we were in love, and then we fell in love.”
He joked about the possible criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unlike a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why has Trump given up so much?
Trump said, mocking the tone of voice of a newscaster:
"I have not given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to UN General Assembly leaders that North Korea does not see a "correspondent response" by the US to its country's first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump’s view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help to free hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded enclosure, we’d have about 200,” Trump said, noting the crowd in front of him.
An Island Destroyed and Hundreds Dead in Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not safe even if foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies are allowed to contribute in offering help.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country unfortunately remains unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not frequent on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in place, is likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between the huge number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, quite a challenge.
Natural disasters have made logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's damaged infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces next year's re-election loaded with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's ongoing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of fighting in the streets between Christian and Muslim bands with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores the goal of the draw with a shot away from Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his goal scored at the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team was losing 1-0.
He settled the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible shot directed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a large elevation as it propelled towards the right-hand side of the gate.
The ball finally started the descent above a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create the maximum amount of time I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanté coming, I did a touch and I didn't think much about it, I just devoted myself to playing."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the playoffs, the frontman of the Blue team returned from the heel a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost the middle of the field and sprinting to the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the midfield.
He then made a magnificent in-depth pass, leaving Hazard inside the area with the ball controlled.
Hazard overtook the defense to finish in the second pole with a shot with his left leg where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped among the ruins of the collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police detain 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding stabbed woman
The murder investigation began after the woman’s body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several stabs at Grayson Mews, John Street; subsequently, a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.

I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything via the on-board camera of the car, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, police said they are reporting the incident to the family members closest to the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are being advised that it will take hours before they can re-enter.
He could be heard as a police officer was telling a man that the entire area is being treated as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
He keeps saying, “It’s terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the area agreed with another van parked outside.
A number of Romanian agents within the agreed zone controlling the block of flats.
Any person who may have information that sends a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, calls 101 or contacts Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 and mentioning file 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction in the purest style of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects of England perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor he did during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed by many to be worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a subject of historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.”
Pig killer kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a yard in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave to an adjoining pig farm.
According to him, in the courtyard there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg garrison had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had broken legs and was full of blood," said the cousin, nicknamed "Wu", according to the Guiyang evening news.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to avoid attacking anyone else, as police gathered evidence at the scene of the crime.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300 kg pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to frighten the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of the blood can act as "trigger".
“They like to play.
They are like children, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't go with the idea of hurting.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rainfall throughout the southwestern U.S.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will bring torrential rainfall throughout northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, eastern U.S. time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward towards the west coast of the US. When the Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity from the US southeast towards the north.
The Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate torrential rains widespread throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause hazardous streams, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall indices close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that rivers may form, given that the situation is getting worse very quickly due to the dispersed character of tropical rains.
It is totally advised not to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can bring windstorms and dust clouds at specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rain at certain points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that total precipitation above 50 mm is recorded, which could lead to smaller waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Insulated shaffles of tropical rain will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
The torrential rains spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be several major temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes in a short distance.
The central U.S. region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to start in October with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S. area, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there are many chances that temperatures will be above average in the east of the U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw Thursday the passionate witness of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness was relayed to six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting Friday's regular programming due to a last-minute turn of events: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this testimony on Friday.
The company averaged viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The audience figures were not immediately available for other channels that relayed the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the people who see it from his office.
Put in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football playoff game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, was the channel with the most audience, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS earned 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after the testimonial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was being scolded by protesters as he attempted to climb an elevator to go to a Judicial Affairs Committee view.
Flake stayed for several minutes with his eyes closed while he was being re-released live on CNN.
“Here I am, in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They told her, ‘You have power, while there are so many women who don’t have it!’
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, commented that he would have more things to say in front of the committee.
Within hours, all cable and broadcast chains were already broadcasting live the moment the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote on whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate Plenary to submit it to a vote.
Flake, on the other hand, said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, a condition demanded by the Democrat minority.
Flake was convinced in part thanks to conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was influential, as it was evident that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the UK and of scorning national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, former May foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on the so-called Chequers Brexit plan, where he says the proposal that the UK and the EU collect each other taxes is "absolutely absurd".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson for Death of LSU Team Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was a member of the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and claim they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to having killed Wayde with a gunshot wound, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police's operative group of fugitives, the state police's forensic lab, Southern University police and local citizens for their help in the investigation that culminated in the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area's law enforcement forces for their "diligence and for seeking justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He averaged 1.98 m, played aerial and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "broken" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
“Things like this are what make you suffer at all times,” Wade said.
A volcano spits ash in Mexico City
The ash splashed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was overseeing several strep and tremors that had recently occurred.

Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcano activity located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined opposing demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independentist individuals detained by the anti-disturbance police began throwing eggs and dust painting at them, causing dark dust clouds to appear on the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that day, riots broke out with the police, who used their porches to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, independentist groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face to face with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were injured during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not diminished in this region of independentist mentality a year after a referendum was held on 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by the Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although the participation rate was low, as secessionists boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to halt voting entering electoral colleges across the region, leading to violent clashes.
The independentist groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the possibilities for Catalonia to achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy because they were able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although by little margin, in the autonomic elections last December, Catalan independentist parties have suffered to keep up the push this year, given that many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained waiting to be tried for their role of independent referendum in the organization.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been aroused by politicians from both sides.
“The tension is only rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year's European Parliament elections.
"To present yourself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the backlash in democratic values and the repression we have seen on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Investing a House in a Car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly invested against a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says that damage was caused to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone shot a bullet against the car.
Menga's play gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was a win.
Livingston, who had climbed the category this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what is just the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as the coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's move made the difference, as with this victory, Gary Holt's team climbs to second place, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, remain without a home win in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers receive the Rapid of Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends his unbeaten league streak to six games, with Holt as a coach who still doesn’t know what the defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the direct game of the visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scoreboard long before the goal, as their direct play caused all sorts of problems at the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way between the defense, but wasted his opportunity when he met in front of the goalkeeper. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out stretching to try to finish the lead pass of Craig Halkett, who crossed the goalkeeper.
The locals were already okay to let the Rangers get close to their area, as they knew that they could put visitors in trouble in isolated plays.
And that’s how that decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a foul against Rangers interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated possession, but they encountered an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work to do throughout the game.
The stage was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to take a merit break.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, for his part, stopped Scott Pittman on one occasion and Lithgow diverted another move from Livingston.
The Rangers devoted themselves to hanging again and again balls in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for Halkett's supposed entry to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another by hand. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they still exceed all expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top category, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be at Menga's side throughout the game.
The Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They did not know how to create opportunities (only once they clearly outperformed the local defense), and this the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Receiving sweetness for Erdogan in Cologne
It was all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
The police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around it to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves felt while condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion that exists around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled a dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics attended the cyclist, he died at the event.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a crash in Childers Street, 1 mile (1.6 km) from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said its agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest relatives.
The street has been cut and deviations have been applied to bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in a riot
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation in this high-security men's detention center, according to the center's office.
The events took place at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and are still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado" agents traveled to the scene to end the altercat, in which eight inmates have been involved. The avalot could be contained by one side.
Officers had to be taken care of for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a spokesman for the prison service: “We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to resolve an incident that occurred in Long Martin’s prison, which is still ongoing.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to answer to the police and may have to spend even more time in the garage."
The Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was learned that the head of the prison had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by a convict.
In addition, in October of last year, riot police officers made an act of presence in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which center staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (dry areas could be benefited)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early next week when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and is approaching Monday night with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a statement that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression within a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where they would register up to 150 mm in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the Rosa rain could become a very good news, given that the region is suffering from a severe drought.
Although the rivers are a serious cause for concern, some of the precipitation could be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reports.
But first, hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.
Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Precipitations in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm".
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah well into the night on Tuesday.
"The main risk we expect from Rosa or what remains of it is very strong precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Rainfall is expected to cause hazardous rivers and waste streams in the deserts, along with landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teen was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the following day in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The agents have made a call for anyone who may have some kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone to be contacted.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered the meekness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in an election decree in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the meekness and anger" of the Democratic party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh declared before Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford sexually abusing her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also made a statement in connection with his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that on that day, “the American people saw Kavanaugh’s genius, human quality, and bravery.”
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable trajectory of service to the citizenry,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he talked about the importance of the Republican voter turnout index in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m actually running,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are dedicated to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, an assistant to the Republican party leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by giant waves crashing onto beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday on the occasion of a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters impacted the coast towards dusk, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything that was in their way.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they did not run immediately. That's why they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it destroyed everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
There are people who climbed on top of a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
About 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the number of shops and buildings is appreciated, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information arrived" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, which unfortunately could end up being much worse," he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a footage of an amateur shared on social media, you may feel as a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate shouts of warning to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water exploded at the edge of the sea, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in electricity supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say the evacuated people still desperately need food, in addition to other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for emergency tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where the employees sheltered in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It is a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the bleak gesture of starting relief work, some people complained that it was preventing humanitarian workers from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, provisions and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says ‘well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing people kept hoping that the miracle would occur and their loved ones would evade the devastating account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a double blue mark.
“I think that means the messages weren’t received,” he added.
Thieves Take $26,750 While Filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "drawn behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “Being formally known as Kanye West.”
A while ago, 41-year-old West was nicknamed Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the show.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I’ve gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good side, our bad side, our confused side, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former collaborator, has chosen his nickname with or without a script and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, when there is little time left for the country to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a cruel retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "military force would never again be used to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooted throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government announced measures on AI, despite the country’s overall lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s number one in AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicating the AI research budget would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the U.S. and we want to be the pioneers of the upcoming advances in the field of AI,” Lee said.
“Duplicating funding could double the chances for the U.S. to achieve the next big discovery in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In 1980, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that outperformed the top-ranked American Othello player and subsequently served as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee positively assessed previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify upcoming visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “It’s not China that takes academic leaders; it’s companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
“I think permanent residence cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in AI,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its Plan for the development of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence.
“The National Natural Science Foundation of China grants funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other U.S. public bodies give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve collaborators from the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently devotes more than $100 million a year to AI research.
In the meantime, no action has been taken in relation to the U.S. legislation that aimed to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to “North Macedonia Republic,” a measure that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia’s requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbor’s name constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign casts doubt on whether the minimum participation required of 50% will be reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question indicated on the referendum paper is: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve accession of Macedonia, one of the countries created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have expressed that they will stick to the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority in Parliament is required.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the name change of the country, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, like China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
Zaev said that a “yes” would be “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would take part in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, led by the Macedonian channel Telma TV, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard hit for the pro-Western government's policy since it took off in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City's Sergio Agüero scores a goal after bargaining all of Brighton's defense
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2–0 win at the match at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He walked by speed between three Brighton defenses, razing with what came out his way through the playing field.
Afterwards, Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He scrambled a defense before overcoming a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that he found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball in the first touch, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right foot beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot that stuck inside the net on the right side.
“Agüero is having an upset foot,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate to have scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League fight.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball in depth on the field of Brighton and
He made a beautiful pass into space by the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blues frontman finished the ball inside the grid before leaving the bottom line.
City will face off Tuesday at Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League, at 18:55 h, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off fight, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to go to the pitcher's mound next Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold a lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a draw with a 5–2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still seeking their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can go out and launch knowing the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably compete every point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
“Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals are yet to announce an opening pitcher for Sunday, but they are apparently determined to let Scherzer throw if this situation occurs.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a warm-up session on Thursday and would launch on Sunday, on his usual rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-offs in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the great, great.. I don’t introduce myself, but in reality I do. That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all the necessary means, their meekness is seen, their bad intention.
They don’t care who they hurt, over whom they have to go to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we won’t give them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to “resist and obstruct.”
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he said, taunting Democrats of "angry, mean, dirty and fake."
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which provoked a strong public outcry.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, eh, no. Wait a minute... That was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party has ceased to be a different party.
He is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of British MPs to whom we have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My fellow Member of Parliament Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she demonstrated with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, they are similar issues with respect to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a notice to the Nottingham Labour Party meeting on Friday, it said: “We want meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings held on Friday night have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “more generous and kinder” policies has long been forgotten if ever existed.
It is becoming increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged according to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to take a 180-degree turn and take positions he would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, denouncing center policies and telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the messages I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who have to deal with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every “no confidence” motion or every change in the rules of selection, the party gets tighter.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice and have been recommended that I keep my head down, that it is not so expressive and “everything would be fine”.
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by Thatcher’s negligent government, which left my entire class literally submerged, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councilor or as a government minister.
I’ve never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is walking towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: some unbeaten Ayr lead
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved the win in this vibrant Tennent's Premiership day game.
The Ayrs, who are the only unbeaten team of the ten, rank first on the standings.
In the end, the local team prevailed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have put us to the test and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie commented: “Congratulations to Ayr, they’ve taken advantage of the opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayrs ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, ceded to the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended the Ayrs' advantage with a penalty and, just halfway through, scored and converted a rehearsal to put the 17-5 scorer in favor of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melroses started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Afterwards, the game was interrupted for a long time due to the severe injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who withdrew in bed, and at the rematch the Ayrs again extended the distance with a Stafford McDowall rehearsal converted by Climo.
Subsequently, Deputy Captain Blair Macpherson was amnestied with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a plating at Climo without a ball, from the penalty alignment, MacPherson scored a back-test behind the penetrating mole of the Ayrs.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to the third line wing Gregor Henry to score the local team's fifth rehearsal.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be about to move into the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comic partner.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source for The Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flowering restoration sector".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, without coastline, expects the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the ship's headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings waving a blue sea flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are pampered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Across the landlocked territory of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a crude resource conflict in the 19th century is still very vivid, as is the desire to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will dictate in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign sea exit for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes laid in Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ’s resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a setback in the past four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has seized the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
“Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any gesture of goodwill by Chile,” he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was exceptionally swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crossroads.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements come at a time when it seems that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a chimera to think that continuing sanctions and the U.S.’s objection to a declaration ending the Korean War could make North Korea ever kneel down.
Washington is suspicious of accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament moves before.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is taking seriously the issue of renouncing an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of large hats, from the road to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been ravaged by very impractical hats, and this designers have brought their amazing creations to the walkway.
Valentino's highlight piece was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing, that flooded the models' heads.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jellyfish, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of straw masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, brightly colored, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high-stitched ones.
One creation resembled a complete scuba diving team, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cone.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
Large hats tread on the heels of "The Bomb", a straw hat, with a wide wing of two feet, which everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult tag behind the hat so impractical that it spread through social media brought another great creation to the walkway: a beach straw bag, almost as big as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The rafia bag, dark orange, adorned with rafia straps and finished with a white leather ribbon, was the highlight of the collection La Riviera SS19 by Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame that the demand for large accessories would be ignored.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
Independent Schools of Scotland maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to offer the best level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher studies, for the career they choose and for their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest ratings in independent schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A grade.
The data, collected from 74 member schools of the SCIS reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A grade.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17% of the reasons employers gave to it that it was difficult to cover the vacancies were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he/she has learned a second language, he/she will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% did not know a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland, there is diversity among schools as to the languages being taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are thought to be more important for the UK in the future, by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, you can always choose from a number of languages in independent schools, which have teaching staff specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In today’s global trading environment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be of vital importance to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered truly “international communicative skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
We have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still have to determine the minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need preseason games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaigning events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump meetings scheduled for next week, which include visits to sympathetic places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing that began this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense over the sexual abuse allegations he faces, while the Senate’s scheduled confirmation vote is on hold for up to a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans who are running for office in the delicate November election gain momentum.
President Trump’s five campaign rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head into a busy campaign season,” a Trump spokesman said.
This evening's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather sympathizers "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, it will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia, where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting some unfavorable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows ambition to keep hopes alive for Sunday’s individual matches
After three unequal sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this one.
So on what side is the positive dynamic now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I think we’re in a small positive streak,” Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more in play.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be cheerful, largely because of the shape state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his lap and made a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar cry, indicating that he believes the American team is not yet out of competition.
“You have to do your best and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but adorable European couple carry four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who did not make a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the bullish public, it is reaffirmed that it is the players who beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's fourballs, who paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged the Spanish and the Swede into a hole from which they had no choice.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see from the interactions between pairings, the tips they give and the ones they don’t, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with a significant advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reaches the Ryder Cup final with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a struggling Tiger Woods and leave his record, so far, at four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago to Hazeltine, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fours and set the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance to foursomes and won two games, but were unable to narrow the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in Sunday's 12 individual matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they scored a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning's fourballs, paired again with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all on a pleasant and windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday, scoring two points.
They scored a 2–1 decisive victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later re-winned Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history a team had made a four-point difference in individual games, although the title defender Furyk's team only needed to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counter-attack coming Sunday is out of its reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm “in any way” if signs of confidence are not appreciated
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying his mistrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "important measures of goodwill" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and committing to not proliferating nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not observe any consonant response from the US,” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not unilaterally begin disarmament in any way."
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase-by-phase” denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps gradually, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization at all, as Pyongyang had already done.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. incumbent president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while promising guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that sooner Pyongyang must eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearization must occur first and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, in addition to opposing the "end of war declaration," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are intensifying our mistrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea rather than the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to an end."
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from what he held last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President “Mr. Evil” Trump dubbed Kim “Rocket Man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there is still a lot to do and sanctions must remain until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously pushed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then communicated that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July, claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "a gangster's own demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took “consequential measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “consistent measures” he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on resting habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep longer, in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of caffeine-stimulated overnight study.
One academic noted that students at the number one university in the world are often distracted by what goes into the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after making a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the conversation, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, all this, in my last year?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, implemented for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, of one hour duration, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, bamboos and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying awake all night long still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure that students suffer make sleep deprivation an ever-growing problem.
Making sure to enjoy good quality sleep for enough time should be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in ignition mode and makes students always want to have it.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask postgraduate students to perform a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to take into account the fact of putting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home which means another knocked out.
The Ibrox team sought to add their first home win since last February's triumph by 4-1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave their team adrift, 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Premier Ladbrokes.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes ahead of halftime, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equalize the score.
While the Rangers now drop to sixth place, the Livingston rise to third position, behind the Hibernian by difference of goals.
And the Rangers could face further difficulties afterwards, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the ranks.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that wiped the Ayrs in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven-header who scored a point against the Hearts last week. Probably, he felt satisfied by the way his well-organized team smothered his rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated the possession, the Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder kicked off and missed the big opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs's blunt foul pitch met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot at the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a penalty at the 15-minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only scored two shots in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's doc.
While the Livi's first act in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only because of their effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to fight with Jacobs's hard-working move.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard acted at the break by switching Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had an almost immediate impact as the end made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingston continued to capture the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's side could have ceded direction in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a deviated shot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still called for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made big eyes.

And now a page of the "Sunday Morning" Almanach: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day when the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as the "Geiger computer".
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science ever since, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently unsuccessful cowboy physicists:
Home: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emanate from radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "I'm sure it's exploding right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
A New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ and Eliminate Malignant Cells
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
You can “see” a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "favors the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL show.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was written to the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began to criticize Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“Every time I talk to white people, they say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
“Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It was not clear if Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not treated well amongst the backstage because of the hat he wore.
“They threatened me in the backyard.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I'm from Assetjar.
And then they say I’m in a lower position,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said that he would put on Superman's coat so that they could not tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
He tried to love me.”
His comments prompted the public to write at least twice, and the program's crew seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter who explained to the publication: "The whole study was completely silent."
West acted as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left much of the audience perplexed with the performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West got the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR DISTAINING BETWEEN THE MULTITUDE."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful.”
“But I have chosen not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that he was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the disappeared legend of Prince music changed its name to a symbol and, subsequently, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbed to death at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in east Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of a male hero, claiming that these roles imply that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said he believed "something had gone wrong" and that it was questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that she is quite determined to face this problem.
“Personally, I’m now wondering where we’ve been wrong about masculinity,” he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television can have part of the responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so masculine characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this facet of virility?
I think it’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
“Something has gone wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series' ending is scheduled for next summer, saying he is tired of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best he has ever provided Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Given the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of appropriate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican senators and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
“Lies, lies and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was posted by someone unknown at the Capitol during a session of the Senate Commission on sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
“This unfounded allegation is completely false and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, the identity, personal data and security of which have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this leak.
This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of indignation,” Fleischer wrote.
"This makes me think he has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
You don’t have to be challenging.
You do not have to question the motives of the accused.
You have to be calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It matters if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
“We will ensure that the criminals are revealed, and that they will be held legally responsible for all actions they have taken that have harmed all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's limited spy parody
It is already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this replacement of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Will this humorous self-satiry about how despicable we are be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent with out-of-the-box eyes and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew his license for a second time to tear it all apart. His name indicates more than anything else that it is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquid glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Cars of Fire to the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson who represented Barclaycard's now-forgotten television commercials, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this last trip of JE.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the blades of the propeller rebounded to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is seen, but humor seems quite fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the mute gags of the Mr. Bean character represented by Atkinson.
The premise now repeatedly topical is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British top-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the service agent's dismay, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this plastered character of Teresa-May, but the script does not get any further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy puts himself in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirees.
And that includes scoundrel Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some luxury institution, but giving unofficial classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sequestered sufferer Bough, a role replayed by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit untapped.
So Batman and Robin when things get very ugly in Her Majesty's secret service go into action once again and find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: disguised as waiters, they burn down a French fast-food restaurant, they sow chaos by smuggling on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with the interior of the house.
All the stops have certainly been drawn from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
Pretty normal things.
As with the other Johnny English films, it hasn’t helped to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to spend the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers giving them one more day of celebration.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit into the party’s economic agenda and plans to lean the country in favor of workers.
The shift to a four-day work week counts on the support of the trade union confederation Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and into the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a spokesman for the Labour Party: "A four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
Shadow minister John McDonnell used last week’s party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The minister’s plans in the shadow also imply that shareholders of water companies might not recover all the investment, as the Labour government could apply “deductions” for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on the boards of companies and create inclusive equity funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I’m serious,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the session that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it all happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, and confident.”
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it in a blunt way," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people I appoint will be able to verify it.
He is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything changing again.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
New York City will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive programme of stars, who carry out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of the world event at the end of the 20th century.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help actively combat it.
To receive a free entry for the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP entry), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to awaken awareness about the goal.
What success has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case of what we call “clitivism” (people who think it makes the difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “shares” of its supporters, which have helped to achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2.2 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based investor and developer association that pledges to “help children grow as much as possible” and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footprint of history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on his website asking “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen replied, "It's going to be a long and hard road. Sometimes, we'll fall and we'll fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements of the past, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, featuring Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, “if necessary,” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they are already doing in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blockade, to prevent its energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that self-defines as the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are indeed the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage and replace fuels,” he said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11,000 million and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110,000 million cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Russia’s Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (FDI), has called on the US to step aside the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "consider carefully" her 2020 presidential nomination.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "consider carefully" her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, for women to hold high office,” she said.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president seriously."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was “bringing the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “It is clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believed he shouldn’t be running for office by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters have said the senator should not appear, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the proposal.
The poll revealed broader support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats that were considered in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites TEPT Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“With what has been going on with my own son since he returned, I can understand other families suffering from the ramifications of PTSD and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers return,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following about his son and other war veterans: "They get a little different, they get hardened, they get back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented an amicus curiae in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit the U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where large numbers of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
Federal laws require that asylum claims be awarded according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
“Asylum is available to those people who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in one sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense," 35-year-old Risa Kusuma said as she reassured her son with fever in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Lack of drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to pick up flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are being treated outside due to repeated heavy shaking.
Tears came out of his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor room of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I couldn’t hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they’re okay.”
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassment with “propaganda announcements.”
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday addressed China Daily's payroll supplement to the Des Moines Register, the state's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, an accusation that China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase of Washington’s campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to insert ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen tariffs rise on mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters from states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the longtime U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is doubling harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of free speech and free press to insert a payment announcement in The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the kiosk down here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was circumventing the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans set women voters aside before midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
With many of the top Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and the majority of Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation to be conducted is enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate lobby while Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be out of the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
“People say they’ve been tall already; it’s true.
But there could have been more, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote when they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, where he detailed his claims for sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed with the confirmation.
“This has become an entanglement for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the defendants’ bench. It also has to do with how Republicans have handled this issue and how they have treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford stele and the witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the scale slightly declining towards the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony unquestionably or likely, while 35 percent say they believe in Kavanaugh’s testimony unquestionably or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh lied likely or undoubtedly during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford and at least another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez denounces that the Supreme Court candidate taught him genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s solid open source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the emerging company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform to allow users to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, pending task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They’re all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive of the personal online data warehouse is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrate appropriate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some in-house developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely emptied overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a press release Saturday that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial tombstone at a parade Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificantly symbolic" that the gravestone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with "maximum courage", advanced the line before throwing himself over a single-handed cannon and leaving three members of the detachment atone.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never equal, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, saw the Peppa Pig in its place
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 and being denied the most important event.
The San José poster contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and were to be watched live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, viewers in the UK were stunned when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted to have spent the night awake until the morning to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as "a kind of vomiting accent."
“Government regulations say that at 6:00 a.m. this content is inadequate, so they switched to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Fuck the pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about rehearsal, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But there are six o’clock in the morning of a Sunday and we will not be able to resolve it until Sunday at our own time, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it back to the fans, but it ended.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ to Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old athlete has stated that he did not realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father had remained important to him in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" others because "it was not socially acceptable like boys and girls."
“Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world triathlete explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013, "took me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you go through when you are young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a child to whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "all his perspective" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold,” he said.
“There are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named the same as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t say, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be there to occupy the front row,’” he said.
“As I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until then that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of my whole life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at some Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the selection of his first song (Proud by Heather Small), which he had listened to in preparation for the Olympics and which still put on his hen's skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
An exacerbated Mickelson presented at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his physical condition if he does not want to become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modalities.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been usual for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments divides his time between being an animator and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult career of Le Golf National, where the long rough is used to punish the deviated kicks.
And if his own trajectory isn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth game, will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down on starting the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson’s game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He fully understood his role for that day, gave me a slap in the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me that he would be ready the next day," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t think of him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how he trained and that’s how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record of the most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that has not matched your individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has contributed intangible to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great teammate," he said.
“I think the younger players were also having fun hanging out with him this week, which has been fun to watch.
It brings a lot more to your game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage may soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they achieved the win for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"And you keep reminding us that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a short time," Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the 2018 team win by 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the National 10 in the scoreboard.
“History has taught me and all the members of the team that it’s not over yet.
You have to go to the whole machine tomorrow.
You have to get out and do it all right.
This does not end until the points go up to the marker.
We have a goal, we try to win the trophy, and we have to stay focused to do it.
I’ve already said it, I’m focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but I’m also aware of who our rivals are: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow’s individual performance will make the difference and change everything.
It’s great to be with a teammate when everything goes well, but individual duels test your ability to play golf to the fullest.
This is the message you have to pass on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than in a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the last-day hills, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he replied to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, motivated his players before the final day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start on a good foot, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the upswing against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I chose this order because I think it covers all the possibilities,” Bjorn says of his selection for individual clashes.
The new warship of Germany, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it will not do so until at least next year due to faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bomb missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other highlights include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the avant-garde ships, which were expected to project into Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was already news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once it had been delivered.
Few details of the reasons why it was returned are known, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that rendered it useless if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the former Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the ship's weight is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, given recent warnings indicating that Germany's maritime military power is being weakened.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, has acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used".
The officer said the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were stopped, but no new ones were provided as spares.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new study on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed.
The findings are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, as well as northern ear and water bats in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
Volunteers and staff of the UK National Health Service will also perform mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed landscape image of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor at the National Foundation of Scotland, expects the results to show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the UK has declined considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do the paper mortars and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as the attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo locating technique to locate insects and obstacles that interpose in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts with the appropriate training, who perform surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues in a regular way.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave Estate farm, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The farm's administrator, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threave, we have a large area for bats,” he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
Notes the importance of checking for bats before doing maintenance tasks on properties, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young, which could result in the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, molest them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Foundation for the Conservation of Bats, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their populations."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the allegations of rape against him are "fake news" and has claimed that people "want to become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The head coach of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 at the time for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said they were “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says the five-time Ballon d’Or winner on camera.
“They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it’s part of my job.
I’m a happy man and everything is in order,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have described as “inadmissible information of suspicions about privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed at the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "99% good guy", except for a "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sex, but were consented to.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and was taken photos of the injuries at the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courts because she was "fearful of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he has signed for Juve, the Italian giant, in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million operation.
Brexit: UK 'would always regret' losing car makers
The UK would "always regret it" if it lost its status as the world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal in late March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Exiting the EU without any agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU countries has aroused fears from other UK automakers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is made on a "just on time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the UK leaves the European Union without reaching any agreement on 29 March, there may be riots at the border, which the sector believes could lead to delays and fish shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a result.
Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We have to reach an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“Tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union at the plant, has stated that members begin to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never return."
A government spokesman said: “We have devised a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump’s expected meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for a week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Russia and Trump’s aid and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and jeopardizes Mueller’s independence has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but postponed the meeting to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the entire Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "A date has not yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be delayed one more week for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might refute this claim: Sanders has not held any White House briefings since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lack of briefings was not because he disliked the flattery of television journalists, although he said, "I will not deny that they are flatterers."
He then hinted that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, before adding the following without citing any sources: “We have consulted this data.”
Sanders said the briefings will continue to take place, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States, it is much infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you have seen us do it a lot in recent weeks and will replace the briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press wheels are uncommon.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal and, at times, strange appearance in front of the gathered journalists.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers of Scottish National Health Service over fears of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes that they continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of state-of-residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know these are difficult times for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU colleagues, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service task, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers' Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday in a 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Tennessean's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
“He came to the band line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him in a crib and taking him to do more testing.
A Tennessee State official has informed Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type or scope of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after hiring from Illinois.
He had completed five sets on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people under the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of the Corbyn movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be charged to those people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The company expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher bell tax on buying a property in the UK and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of the Jeremy Corbyn movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher rents.
The increase in the stamp tax will be charged to those people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will be allocated to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
The company expects to earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are from non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to get on the property scale.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in the bell tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster."
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on the rental and the end of the “no-fault” removals.
It also wants to give more power to city councils to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be right that it is equally easy for people not living in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away and the indignity of homeless people makes it all even more real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to coach Scotland”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "maximum ambition" is to be the coach of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in League One, three points ahead of the leader.
He reached the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a supporter and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching a lot playing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it's always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in coaching clubs, though.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach claims he doesn't feel pressured to be next on a list of names consecrated in such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be if I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is obvious that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I've been successful here if I can get the club back."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical body.
He helped the Alloa avoid dropping to the third category and transformed the St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the post at Alloa.
“I always thought that training was the best thing I could do, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I got out of it reasonably and I enjoyed pretty good algid moments.
Playing can be very hard.
There are a lot of things you need to overcome each week.
I still do it in aspects like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I was an adult.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave has triggered consumption at Britain's troubled bars, but it has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains achieved a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the financial advisory firm CGA, the company that collected the data, says the following: "The continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has been extended more than expected, have caused July to follow a pattern similar to that of June, with the increase of 2.8% in the bars.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have achieved the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we consulted, beverage sales increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the external leisure market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% year-on-year would be especially damaging, more than the continued pressure for costs.
This long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving businesses and time will tell if the milder temperatures we had in August will provide this much-needed breath.”
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, as it indicates the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for restaurants, bars and taverns in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million and is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid rise in “false Insta” accounts, a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a net “principal” account that they show their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Board of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of teens between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, of which half have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the directive of the Scottish athletics federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation at the organization's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with the most medals from Scotland and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who drive the sport to benefit from his diligent international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive,” Beattie said in a statement.
Doyle said: "I am very eager to act as the voice of the athletes and I look forward to being able to grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200th and 400th at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's time to do agility exercises!
“Thank you for your heartfelt messages!”
A bulletin board ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A sneaker company has shared the opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares nursing mothers with cows who feed themselves.
To mark the launch of what is considered the “first silent sling that can be brought from the world,” consumer tech company Elvie has released an announcement inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom that the new sling gives to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of forage and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I muñe myself, but you will not see any tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not brats, but my breasts".
The return continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, muño the girls".
However, the announcement, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixture of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth.”

Another person commented: “Understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a sling for mothers who will preserve their babies?”
Another user added: "It's an out-of-place ad."
Others defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
To pump for the slide made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit of a madness, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who pump pull-outs (usually at their workplace or in the toilet and feel like they’re cows.
It is not an announcement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the slingshot discreetly placed on the supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say that they feel like cows when they use the pulley.
However, the Elvie pullover is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women more freedom to move, hold the babies and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and early childhood developer, said: “Elvie’s tire is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how to use a sledgehammer and the challenges involved in doing so, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new sledgehammer.
This isn’t the first time Elvis has appeared in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen even though monthly cross-border admissions have remained virtually stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country if they decided to adopt a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential fathers and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to host unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month after being detained, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered eligible for aid will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent rampages or attempts to flee, according to workers and reports released by the system in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked.
They have added that moving children to camp without having time to emotionally prepare them or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges "occupation forces" of US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the eight-year-old war in the country.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “the matter will be dealt with accordingly.”
“They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the "war on terror has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and of “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Muallem said conditions were good for his return and blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears" that make refugees want to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats have said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the last major rebel bastion, Idlib, has favoured the opportunity to continue with political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russia's help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will face the jihadists, which include al-Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to begin shaping a post-war constitution and paving the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 election again unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, scandals and the dismissal process end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the end of a most dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in peak audience hours has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak audience time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has led cable TV audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"People have been thrown into it because they don't understand it," said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor" series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
"He said that because he made him laugh," Scovell told me.
There is a point of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go beyond the horns when you find yourself at the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts debate the use that Bob Woodward has made of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", the 15,000-dollar ostrich leather jacket of Paul Manudar's "Gruna" title.
I’m not going to see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes it seem like it's part of a reality TV program is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the character changes and script turns of the Trump program (battle with the NFL, praise Kim Jong).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house he has on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed closed watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be disengaged, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
“I remember when we were doing those bubbly programs back then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but I think they were right.”

Foreign money floods the races of the midterm elections to the tightest House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that there is a cash flood in Pennsylvania’s 17th District, thanks to the realignment of the congressional districts that has made two current members have to compete for the same square.
This recent redeployment of the Pittsburgh suburban district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decreed in January that the former districts were divided unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a tightened victory in a much-followed special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have been in office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support to China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which in 2017 received US aid of 140 million dollars, was considered, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll from murder and unemployment.
With the steps of the internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and that was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any likelihood of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys returned discreetly to their posts in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, which include two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations from the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymity, corroborated their statements.
Studying History
The next event to occur could be Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in public records.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in his attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be held accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even in front of a jury of party members.
These are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over turning points like this and accelerates or delays the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing a number of inversion points.
What happens if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water on his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested registering the president secretly and speculated that it was not suitable for the post.
Rosenstein says the Times' information is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And especially, will we vote in mid-term for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to run into danger.
But I don’t think we’ll fail, because I’ve already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the vase.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw at the Vila-real field this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the 2–2 draw against Vila-real, but believes the Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We played the game believing that we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten something more out of it in the end, but overall, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it’s another great European night.
We hope to be able to stay with all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game, but I am sure we will give it all and get a good result with the support of the amateur.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is good and the guys enjoy it, the trainings are good.
I hope we can give it all, leave the past season behind and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people spoke to the family.
Approximately half of respondents nationwide say they have talked to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10% of respondents say they have spoken to their children.
“People want someone to care for them, but they don’t dare to ask,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
We have to start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to decide where and how to receive attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, an effective value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover your expenses, or your own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money to make it.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the step into legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals meet your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Consider also the possibility of contracting a notary for your finances.
It is advisable to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly family member has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“Finance is not the only factor that needs to be determined, but also which doctors you want to treat,” Martin said.
"What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan prepared.”
Man shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots from a compressed air rifle as he returned home after leaving for the night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (British summer time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His life is not in danger because of the injuries and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
As communications are cut, relief units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Célebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, a lower administrative region than a province, had a population of approximately 299.200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Celebes Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in western Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific fire belt and earthquakes are common in Indonesia.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Ace province, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook a pop zone in Padang City, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as the population recalled the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died because of the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she drew his phone.
Palin is detained at Mat-Su’s provisional detention center, where he is detained with an unsecured bond of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he was declaring himself, according to the chain.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been registered against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His wife said she had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake shook Indonesia's Celebes Island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Exceptional Death Penalty for Suspect of New York Terrorist Attack
New York federal prosecutors call for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary sentence that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a West Side Highway bike lane in Lower Manhattan and hit pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and that he “intentionally” caused serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both offences could result in the death penalty, according to the court’s document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-officer indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mob cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required “considerable planning and premeditation” and described Saipov’s behavior as “inhumane, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the southern district of New York brought a case of the death penalty to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators that they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
According to police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be deployed to his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of misdemeanor.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the indictment decision.
“We consider that the decision to call for the death penalty, rather than accepting a plea of guilt and a life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular troops" during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP without charge Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when pro-union conservatives have presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to preserve her Chequers commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, EU supporters and the EU.
Allies insist they will reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to undo Chequers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to break Chequers’ commitment.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed their mindset and wants to stay there is totally false."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: “I’m just telling you, Prime Minister, listen to the people.”
“Chequers’ commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who take to the streets and get us to win elections.
He abandoned Chequers' commitment and began to listen."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said that the politicians at the rally must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country who gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners over conservatives against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to consider running for president. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been the center of speculation about the possibility of Trump re-election in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the format of an open meeting since Trump took office.
An assistant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that “it’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our government that doesn’t work, and that includes a woman on the dome.”
A person arrested for the death of Sims, from the LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the death of LSU Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head which eventually killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the team's orders handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's team orders would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxing earlier and let Hamilton run with traffic at the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at boxes and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to abandon the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap he was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
Subsequently, he continued in good position for much of the race, as he retained his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen and move to fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxes at lap 44, but was unable to increase the pace at the following eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job of having a U-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was awful.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people are "bad, cruel and liars."
“One thing that could happen and the nicest thing that’s happening in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry, bad, cruel, and lying people,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they say ‘No, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... Did you filter the document? "Hey, what?
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn’t filter it,” he added while mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied the leak coming from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked me to.”
But his denial displeased the President, who commented at the rally Saturday night: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
“Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the statements for their own purpose.
“They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to hit to have power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite defeat against the Belfast Giants as they won the 5–3 return match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately got a two-goal advantage thanks to the finishes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie rose to the level of their team, but afterwards, Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard tied the Dundee. Then, two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this turbulent initial period, Sullivan re-positioned the home team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first pause when he scored the second night's goal at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of passengers on plane from earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after dying to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are being produced in the area and there are many people trapped among the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat at the trembling control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take the flight.
He then stepped out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He later died in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“It broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a statement.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
The military and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working clockwise to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline that operated a flight that crashed into a Pacific pond in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although previously it was said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane moored in the lagoon because the runway was short.
Some witnesses believe the plane skidded the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working nearby to improve a pier also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to carry the affected people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters inside the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst compiles a chronology of the night that burned a woman alive
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to build the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the Sanford van that night, Sanford said he had lied because his van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"It wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held by the jury over the course of the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative vision of the genre.
Bristol's The High Breed says hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and put the conscious hip-hop back into fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK from the hand of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Nurse Sues Couple for Dismissal After ‘Racist’ Message
A New York nurse has denounced a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from her mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist and compares the demand to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed consternation when she saw the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her guilt, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny she had dismissed, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the payment corresponding to her work day and then she was sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice claims compensation from the couple for the dismissal and asks for compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month residency job for which she was hired, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do things like that," he told the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to statements that they are racist by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid that they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t want to say.
He is not racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been bitter, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to an "extortion," said his wife had two months to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
Are you going to pursue something like this?
It’s not a very friendly attitude,” added the investor banker.
The legal case is still pending and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and to condemn their behavior and logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It’s very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book on a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "sweet", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and adds that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
“He was a discreet man; he wasn’t a presumptuous one,” he said.
“But as Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you’re proud, even if it’s not your thing.
I think that’s how he considered Paddington’s success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington’s own merit.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Upon landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked to save her life.
“Nad called frequently to say that it was very serious and that they didn’t expect him to get over it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad and he told me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medications they had given him to keep his body battering were being consumed and were coming out of his system.
He had died before what was planned and so everything was erased.
I just had to sit back and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to stay in good shape.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience that was going on.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I had my head down and my tears didn’t stop falling.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling that needed my love and understanding.
I knew he loved her very much.”
Women in mourning hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parents to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, a resident of Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I am continually concerned that there is a side effect.”
Ms. Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can turn to, that you can listen to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
“He never said he wasn’t feeling well or depressed or anything like that,” he said.
A couple of days before Christmas we saw a change of attitude.
He touched the bottom on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
He said his death meant a great trauma to them, but they had to work it out: "It opens a hole in the family.
It's ruining us.
But we have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared the committee would be destroyed with the supporters' entrenched deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
There are only five weeks left for the midterm elections on November 6. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened in getting the man they want elected to arrive at the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators and pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of defectors “drops” with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Normally, the vast majority of North Korean deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
Sources in Seoul say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants, rather than refugees, and often repatriates them forcibly.
North-South relations, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and not fit to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and that his temperament makes him unable to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have told her that she is a ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and being speechless as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the accusations against him meant a "grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by liberals angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's witness showed that he could not work in the High Court, as he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi was reluctant when asked whether he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's election, whether it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats achieved a majority in the House of Representatives.
“This is what I can say: if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you’re not only not capable of being in the High Court, but also not in the court where you are now,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge in the Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he circumvented questions about whether he would override certain decisions of the High Court.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to come to the court and expect it to look wonderful,” Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and he cannot take it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. And you?"
She continued... “A woman who was an executive somewhere helped me a lot who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and she started crying, saying to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for rabies in part because, basically, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a male majority, where I once ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of an older woman (a cold directive that had always terrified me a little bit) who grabbed me by the razor and dragged me up to her neck.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they’ll have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic deputy from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-meaning decision,” he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone once said, “White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As he arrived late in the campaign, he was delayed in raising funds, so he promised that he would not enter the race if he did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When he made his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and orienting himself to voters, instead of doing it to delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he stopped without.
“You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press reaction.
“You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my tomb?
"Did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
The initial savings from the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the war does not seem to have to end soon, a distancing of the countries may prove beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on China’s main exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth $200,000 million. These tariffs entail a taxation on half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has counterattacked in the same way each time and has recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to replicate the U.S. and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to back down anytime soon.
Making Washington backwards means giving in to some demands, but leaning publicly to the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that initiate a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, ravaged by a seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Currently, the situation on the streets is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists demolished to restore normality.
All conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the kick-off to the water in the 316th hole, which yielded the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became one of four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out with a 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 race points.
“I don’t cry, but today I can’t help it.
It has been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so glad I got the cup.
The team is the most important ... and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the relief to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a moment when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought.
I'll take my hat off to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and am proud to have been their captain.
He's got to take his hat off.
He defeated us.”
