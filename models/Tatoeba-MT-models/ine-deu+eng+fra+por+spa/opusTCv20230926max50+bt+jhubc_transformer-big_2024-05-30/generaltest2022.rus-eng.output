From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac age based on their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote literature, of course, from the point of view of the very ladies of the Balzakov age.
And the psychology and torture of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers is not so interesting.
Adolescents are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps roses were teddy bears to depict a certain variety of them?
There are roses of this color and with such a petal structure, reminiscent of velvet, usually dark red, burgundy tones.
And light roses look different, the petals have a satin or silky gloss.
Sharks attack surfers, taking them for turtles...
Bulls are like daltonians.
The bears eat the pooch.
The gorillas DO NOT look into the eyes - in some safari parks, visitors are given glasses with painted eyes looking away.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105<0xD1><0x85>195.
Model "Micropack Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has a different stiffness of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, the moderately soft one is made of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeping body, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, you need to highlight breathable materials.
Latex perforated for air permeability is perfectly ventilated naturally, just like coconut coir.
As a result, a healthy sleeping microclimate is maintained.
The mattress also has an extended warranty period.
The official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the life of the mattress is longer.
Dust and pollution protection is applied to the detachable jacquard case supplied in the kit.
Buy an orthopedic pillow to the mattress – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

It's better not to have any like that...
Either look for a third-party driver, or someone who is willing to invest and work with you in the share.
If it doesn’t work, then sell the car, even with losses, don’t regret it.
Next time, you'd better think...
Andrei, you have been thoroughly explained that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in the command line.
The teacher of computer science can not help either, he was not taught this, the school plays games in windows.
There is no support.
I remember with horror these dinners and guests in my parents' house.
Guests on the threshold, and on the stove more chops are roasting, mother is flattered to house the floor.
Oh, my God, I've been sitting at the table powerless.
And then I'll wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holidays you drag the products, two days of scraping, the day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They are fine, and the cake is with them.
I haven't liked the holidays since.
Even for my family, I make the table minimally.
And I cook them, baking very often just like that.
Germany: The Fourth Coronavirus Vaccine Is Inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with new strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, not two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will likely be enough to fully protect.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt is convinced of this.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, by Die Welt.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, not later than the autumn,” the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccination.”
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help fight the spread of the new strain of coronavirus "Omicron".
The new version is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of recurrence of Omicron infection is three times higher than in Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to deliver a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that at two doses of the vaccine, efficacy is significantly lower: “neutralizing potential is reduced more than 25 times.”
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against micron-strain infection," BioNTech and Pfizer said in a statement.
A third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases Bernd Salzberger advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“The experience of Israel very convincingly shows this,” the expert stressed.
Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21<0xC2><0xAE>.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created to be used for underwater fishing, not just for throw fishing.
These vibes have a greater weight than close analogues in size, which undoubtedly positively affects the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper float made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when catching in the backwater, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive gameplay.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, that is, movements up and down with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, stunted by underwater vegetation, bugs and other obstacles for which trapping is possible.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching a duck and a large dungeon in the winter, and especially in the middle of the winter, when a pointed and aggressive bait feed is required.
Upon reaching the end point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To please her caprice, you can choose between two modifications: with a sound capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib with a game of weightlifting is able to irritate a passive beetle that does not respond even to nerves.
When trapping, the Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy.
This wobbler is clear and not capricious, it combines well with wood and knitted cords even of large diameters.
For the catch, throw a beaver, eel, or eel apart from the uniform topical and "step", sometimes with a "squirrel" at the bottom.
If you’re catching in tangled spots, you can change the front t-shirt to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of catches.
Among the baits of its Bet-A-Vib class is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with the same success in both relatively small and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young unemployed are sitting on the neck of old parents.
The "Golden Youth" are clearly lazy people, mostly, who know nothing and don't know anything.

In Libya reported about 7,000 Russian mercenaries
In Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company "Wagner".
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
"There are currently more than 7,000 mercenaries of the Wagner Air Force in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabia airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) ", - said the agency Anadolu.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are “trying to seize” central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Maintaining Presence
According to the interviewee, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, according to the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Air Force has the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to the media, the "Wagners" allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed either in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of jurists, and its fighters are absent in the staff lists.
The company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the post-presidents of the 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be adopted by the EU Council on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the elections of deputies of parliament and heads of state from December 24 at least to February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the election, and the chances of them passing on time are rapidly decreasing," the report said.
Against this background, the Libyan Supreme Electoral Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy in the eyes of the Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country’s foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of success - "in Syria protected, restored the peace there", "the decision on the Nord Stream 2", "the whole world frightened that cool weapons", "the Crimea we squeezed".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - says in the study of the Foundation "Public opinion".
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned the paperwork - all public services have also become only digital
The government of Dubai has announced a complete rejection of paperwork and the transition to digital technology.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
“Today marked the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai’s life – we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government,” said the Crown Prince, Chairman of the Dubai Executive Board, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, internal and external document circulation in all state institutions in Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all, without exception, the industry: health care, housing, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial entities also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of documents has started in Dubai since 2018.
During this time, the authorities estimated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and $ 353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about the dates of birth and how old the child is, it's already a disaster, about the class and the group in kindergarten, too.
I can't believe there's such a thing.
And if they are, then they clearly care about everything, including the family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandfather with grandmother on 3 Vladimirskaya lived, there was 1 floor without a grid.
They knocked at the door first, then at the window, then decided not to celebrate, broke the window and walked in, but Grandpa had a baseball bat that they got.
They knew there was someone in the house...
Turkey's car production and exports fell below 2020 level
Turkey’s car production and exports fell sharply in November amid depreciation of the pound.
As a result, the industry’s 11-month performance was worse than last year’s, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year ago.
Approximately 75.9 thousand cars were sent for export, which is more than 25% below last year’s figure.
And if after the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed positive dynamics to last year, then after the results of 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this decline was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received credit deferral in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation in granting benefits to small and medium-sized businesses, reports MIA correspondent "Kazinform".
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the regulation and development of the financial market, in the current year, pursuant to the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the President of the Agency dated April 9, 2021, No. 127 "About approval of the procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans of its small and medium-sized entities" was adopted.
He recalled that the procedure for the provision of deferral of loan payments provided for the provision by banks and organizations carrying out microfinancial activities of deferral of payments on loans issued before 1 April 2021 to SME entities, including IP, during the period from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The period of deferment was from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME subject.
In the application of the borrower could be specified a different period of deferral of payments.
During the period of deferment in respect of the borrower, the claim and profit work were suspended, notification of the need to repay the late debt, as well as the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments," the deputy prime minister said.
For 2021, banks of the second level received applications for deferral of payments on loans of 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 SMEs received deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
The IMF has submitted applications for the deferral of 131 SME entities, of which the deferment has been granted to 95 entities in the amount of 105.8 million tenge", - concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain "okmiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those with a strong body defense response.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the strain of coronavirus "okmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the birth of the virus.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immune deficient person.
That is, during the mutation, he did not encounter any resistance from immunity.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, he became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, there may be more than expected, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonary surgeon Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate “okmiron” more easily than those who have a strong protective response of the body.
It turns out that a strong body response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is the case with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-olds die, and 60-year-olds in the form of sneezes tolerate it.
The young man's immune response is infuriating, it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with your finger, he beats like a squirrel gun, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - it is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, wheezing in the throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia by the end of the year can begin to vaccinate the younger generation from 12 to 18 years.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering MFTI Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from covid.
In teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is as high as possible.
This is the most socially active layer, as are kindergarten pupils,” said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the MFTI Genome Engineering Laboratory.
A huge thank you to the author for this article.
I'm glad to refresh my memories...
Teeth-in.
In those distant seventies and eighties, no dance floor went without the melodies of this group.
And at home, gathering with friends, they arranged dances for their music.
Immunologists hypothesize why people with obesity become victims of Covid
The authors studied the fat tissue left over from bariatric operations and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
The scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died from covid, and found particles of the coronavirus in fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid an immune system response.
This is also possible with SARS-CoV-2.
Biologist tells about the causes of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Holosheykin mentioned the causes of dementia and told about ways of preventing it in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person is hardly oriented even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible,” he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sluggish lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for it to occur," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, he was a professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FGAOU in RNIMU.
N.I. Pirogov, Head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova told about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return home some 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat television channel, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has been able to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all smuggled artifacts were recorded in the archives.
The department is currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "monitor auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that on return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the auctioned bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun in London.
Christie’s auction house held auctions on July 4, in which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been auctioned since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively pursuing the repatriation of illegally exported monuments from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggling of antiquities is the result of archaeological searches "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not included" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazakhs) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by a Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees’ personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases – for example, if an employee used it to meet with a customer who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline before which employees can read the new rule.
The Credit Suisse does not officially comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of the life of Sergei Esenin - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is already out of any literary association, he has floated with imaginism, he is on his own, but he is known, in demand, at times strongly slandered by critics, even viciously, but the reader is ready to wear it on his hands.
Over a year, more than 60 poems have been written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" has been completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" has been written, 8 books have been published, the collection "Russian Soviet".
And the main success - at the end of June 25th year, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern Sergei Aleksandrovich poets deserved such an honor, he is the first!
In addition, it sold very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange a family life, to keep the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
Life seems to be getting better, there is something to rejoice about, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Esenin):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don’t know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whistling
In an empty and uninhabited place,
Like I said in September,
It drains the brain of alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin gave up strongly, looks bad, is clearly ill.
More and more often there are blizzards, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Aleksandrovich was put by someone, there are no reliable documents.
Let's say, referring to May 1923, when Esenin at the insistence of the fourth wife, American Isidora Duncan improved health in the clinic near Paris by Professor Peter Hannushkin (again Esenin will come to him two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's chants, scandals on this ground, charges against the police are enough - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, the poet’s terrible novel with the green snake has evolved rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin settled for a short time with his friend, the sculptor Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, with his very good income, Esenin never had his home either in Moscow or in Peter, he was found in removable apartments, in hotels or with acquaintances.
The Elder recalls:
“I only came to spend the night, and in most cases in an unintended, drunk state.
One day, returning at four o’clock in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase.
Falling, he scratched his face and snorted.
When he recovered a little, he began to cough continually, sprinkling all the sheets with blood..."
Yesenin himself, after traveling through Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the United States at the time, but Duncan accepted a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I saw nothing there except the cockroaches and the streets...
I'm at the end and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, he drank, of course...
And I drank because I was thirsty.”

Now his son is almost 16, and he has not been bothered by the desire to hurt.
All the energy is focused on choosing what he will earn for his life.
He is much more responsible than I was in his years or my husband, who periodically had problems with the law before the wedding itself.
A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love."
Why did the girl cry on the exam when she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school?
She'll have a tail.
Well, what?
He'll pass.
Millions of students know this.
What's that all about?
Poland's foreign ministry believes Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon"
Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Jablonski said Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and plans to return to such an “operation” next year.
The deputy head of the foreign ministry made the corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he "is actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
According to the website kp.ru, the European Union has previously put into effect a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they said they are ready to further extend the restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not on the Hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man laugh
The secular events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first one to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die" he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "bondage" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not match the royal dress code for the Earthshot Prize, and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messi tried the trend on himself.
The player came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, who came to "Gazetu.Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular warm velvet jackets with a lining and a sleek silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - sets of velvet suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are featured in almost all brands this season - both Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which one of the premieres of the film "The House of Gucci" ambassador of the brand Jared Leto.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of interweaving threads, a dense fabric with a crisp outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but also, respectively, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vahoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its relevance.
"The barhat requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are gathered for a party or a solemn event, - explains Vahoshkin. - It is also suitable for those cases if the invitation indicates the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with plenty, - the authors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion "Beautiful Brammel". - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, the buyers belong to the caste
They are simply invited to temporary secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vahoshkin offers to combine a velvet jacket with the same outfit things: classic trousers with arrows, monotonous shirts, silk ties, lofers with brushes, wristbands.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from "Beautiful Brammell" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in a velvet jacket of a regular employee at the corporation, but if we are talking about a "leader from among those who fill this event, then - "yes", he has such a thing in the subject.
If the employee is ranked lower, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will certainly appreciate this with the phrase "not according to the hat", - the editors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion.

It’s all about money – alternative energy is well lobbyed, that is, paid for.

No, the price of electricity has gone up.

Perhaps, if such characters and are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not fall for such, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such “beautiful” people, but certainly not because of their appearance.

The immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination after four to five months may protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very large period"
"In the previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," said the expert, calling for re-vaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good title of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and vaccinated, or he got vaccinated and got sick, then he received ‘hybrid immunity’, that is, antibodies that are many and neutralizing enough,” the expert said.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia about "large-scale consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of the heads of foreign affairs in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow a lot,” but the specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the build-up of Russia’s military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” the statement said.
The ministers also called on Russia to “weaken escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities,” as President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Trass said that Russia will be subjected to "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed “a single voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world’s GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia.”
Pfizer Vaccine Considered 32 Times Less Effective Than Omicron-Strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the coronavirus micron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
“We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron-variety,” said Professor Malik Pairis.
At the same time, the scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the micron-strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron-stam can cause a new wave of virus circulation and increase mortality if no additional measures are taken.
Ukraine's Defense Ministry accuses Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of the former Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine’s purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect from Berlin arms supplies under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons at the risk of the development of military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same "illegal" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenskyy said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chair of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

"Mercedes" protested the result of the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi
The German Mercedes team, whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second behind Red Bull driver Max Ferstappen at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, has protested the final result of the race, according to the Formula One press service.
Mercedes believes that the rules of Formula 1 48.12 and 48.8 were violated during the run.

According to the second - Firstappen overtook Hamilton to the allowed "restart" zone.

G7 Warns Russia of Responsibility for Invasion of Ukraine
The G7 foreign ministers warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continues military aggression against Ukraine, the parties’ final statement said.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of the Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” the statement said, published on the UK government’s website.
The G7 ministers and the EU’s top representative noted that they are “only in their condemnation of Russian armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”.
Britain's Foreign Minister Elizabeth Trace warned at a press conference in Liverpool of "great consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to give up its aggression against Ukraine,” she said.
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
The talks were held in the Normandy format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also advocated dialogue on Ukraine in the Normandy format.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that after calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries “were unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes.”

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in conversation with the RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of large losses when entering the data of the bank card into the hands of the attackers, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used in online shopping.
Some of the savings can be deposited into the savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend creating a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, you can start the money-back procedure.
"Under the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility is assigned to the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
Expert from the international payment provider Ecompay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to file an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be contested and refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, the online stores themselves return the funds to the customer, if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, the director of the League of safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 applications were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances can be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream".
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to speak out against Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany to bypass Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany has supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving the crisis.
Poland’s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, stating that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing law and justice party are in violation of EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its supreme court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not take public commitments to stop the work of the Nord Stream 2 in case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an agreement with Germany on stopping the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholtz warned on Wednesday about the consequences if Russia violates the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "Big Seven".
Dmitry, take a closer look.
The view behind the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room has been removed, so the second window is partially visible.
And in general doubt those who are not familiar with the initial planning.
And I know such apartments very well and I can see how it was redesigned.
May they be all right.
It is always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, toilets, windowsills, faucets.
You have them once a year at Easter, or what, you wash them that you have to wash directly.
Just don't get polluted.
Mincifry wants to give writers residences
To the future Fund of support of Russian writers, the state will hand over the federal property left by the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Foundation of the USSR.
On its basis, writer's residences will be created, reported the "Parliamentary Gazette" in Mincifra, which will become the founder of the fund.
Mincifra is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of the Russian Literary Support Fund.
The explanatory note specifies that the foundation will be instructed to take care, among other things, of the purposeful use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union writers and the Litfond.
"The property of the Russian Federation has passed a significant number of objects of real estate, previously owned by the Literary Foundation of the USSR, including objects located in the town of writers Peredelkino, the village of Komarovo of the Leningrad region and others", - reported the "Parliamentary Newspaper".
The draft decree stipulates in the charter of the Foundation that it is "created for the purpose of promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of literaries".
"Under the "creation of conditions for creative activity" means the creation on the basis of transferable property in different regions of Russia of writer's residences, in which there would be comfortable conditions for creativity", - explained in the Ministry of Culture to our publication.

Doctors Warn of the Danger of Long-Term Use of Blood-Thinning Drugs After COVID-19 and Before Vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of blood-thinning drugs after the coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.

The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinners, preventing the excessive formation of clots) as indicated.
She reported that dark-skinnedness is now occurring - everyone drinks anticoagulants for a long time in a row and gets complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (hemorrhage in the brain).
The chief prophylactologist of UrFO, the scientific director of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, the doctor of medical sciences Sergei Tokarev, in conversation with URA.RU, said that the Russians are now often used indiscriminately anticoagulants before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe in dubious advice on the Internet and begin to engage in self-medication.
There are such citizens who, a week before vaccination, by their own decision, begin to take anticoagulants.
And with a preliminary examination before the vaccination, doctors notice hemorrhages.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without figuring out the cause of any symptoms.

The money found in the wall of the church plumber will pay 20,000 dollars
The plumber who found the money in the wall of a church in the U.S. state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This was reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the large evangelical church of Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians await wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Coley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of packages of money and checks under thermal insulation.
He passed on the find of the church and, according to him, did not receive even a thank-you from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is related to a theft that took place at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks, which were stored in a church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, for information about the criminals announced a reward of $25,000.
Justin Coley could not claim this amount, as the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time awarded the prize of five thousand dollars and later received another 20,000 dollars in a gift from the Church of Lakewood, decided to reward the integrity of plumbers.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a person of the real".

In Brazil, they were obliged to demand a passport from the state entering the territory, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brazil.
Citizens who have contraindications to the vaccine are exempted from the presentation of the certificate of vaccination.
Also included in the list of exceptions are people who have arrived from countries where the lack of vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s parties, pre-Carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the tourist flow,” Barroso said.
Previously, the Brazilian authorities obliged non-coronavirus-infected tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
Complete Covid-19 Protection Scheme Revealed
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, honored scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed a scheme of complete protection from coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
With internal use, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. With the injection of the vaccine, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you’ll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G, but there’s still no solution to double vaccination.”
The chief preventologist of UrFO, the doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help by the fact that in this case, the body's protection is supposed to be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, said that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, it is such a picture that is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic has come earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked to the goat (died a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to change the warm house, feeding, caressing, love and play on the liquid bitch, then go ahead.
But the pessimist was trained and clever in general.
He chose my company and went home.
The video is a way that works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I braked many masters not to run after the dog, although they insisted that out, 200,000 run (pomsky), took straight by the hand and led in the other direction.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog, who ran somewhere there.
Mass protests of anti-vaccination protests continue in Europe
More than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid compulsory.
From February next year, non-vaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held in their hands posters that read, “This is a false pandemic,” “I won’t get vaccinated.”
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by the authorities of several regions of the country against the background of an increase in cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against tightening restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then grew into clashes with the guards of order.
A group of protesters started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials used water cannons.
Nicholas S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as the "first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.
Let’s just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
I only agree with Zakharova: the Americans carried only death and looting of any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO has detected a "micron" already in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the new strain of the coronavirus “micron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in a WHO report.
As of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has been actively spreading only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may circumvent the extent of the spread of the strain "delta", it is the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolutely countries without exception.
Previously, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar findings have also been made in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the “micron” will displace the “delta” in the coming months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omicron" at the moment in the Kingdom sick several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain of "microns", and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be transported to hospitals every day.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain "micron" is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "micron" - this will be clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei name center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the strain "omicron".
Why do we see the stages of aging?

Curious White, you are right, communication on the Internet is quite different, communicate easily and uncomplicated, and in a personal meeting and say nothing.
Yeah, and seeing a man live, maybe it's not what you expected, it's not stuck - hence the attitude.
When he meets a man, his views change.
And again, the Soviet era is called "the time of demons."
At that time, people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were raised practically according to the laws of God (love of neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What ideology is today is money at all costs.
Boltuns like Globe of Faith are few (if not at all), but even if so, the time of demons came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad Commune with the Great Greenland still supports communication.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of the relationship of the older generation.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented, and the blockaded fraternity was not canceled.
We see each other more and more at funerals.

Russian warns of new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to the product director of the company Ivideon Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger that is associated with the dissemination of video communication means are diphthongs.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real recordings with the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that by using a diphage, the attackers can call the victims' acquaintances on video or create a video involving a copy of a person to send for blackmail purposes.
“Such counterfeits can easily provoke bullying, as a cunning attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Lead system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to technology using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow me to paint and walk in short skirts, showing socks and pantyhose on my feet.
It's a province, but there was such a commodity in the store.
In the big cities, Muslim women painted, and the beds showed.

Here are five things to do to avoid diabetes mellitus
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regimen - a decrease in the number of various drinks and the transition to regular water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by improper nutrition, but also habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Specialists advise to stick to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the appearance of a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and an increase in absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about the "migraines of the weekend" in the workaholics
There are several factors that can lead to a deterioration in health over the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after workdays is often "the migraine of the weekend", said the famous doctor-endocrinologist, PhD in medical sciences, senior researcher of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of MSU, scientific director of the Clinic of System Medicine Zuhra Pavlova in his telegram.
According to her, this is especially often suffered by workaholics, who have headaches, frailty and weakness on the weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue during the week, there are enough objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to the change of conditions.
Our lives are changing radically over the weekend.
“We sleep long, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more and drink less,” the doctor argued.
Due to overeating and lack of water, it is heavy and broken.”
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a crucial role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most during the weekend.

Scientists in South Africa report low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against “omicron”
In South Africa reported low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists from South Africa conducted a study and reported the low efficacy of Pfizer’s vaccine against the micron-strain coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to the (level) effectiveness of the vaccine at 22.5 percent against infection with symptoms, which is why... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, according to the text of the study, published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the coronavirus micron strain could trigger a new wave of pandemics in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How Much Sugar Is Hidden in Usual Foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under the unknown word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
On the label there may be several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other folded sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), melasma (black duck), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctor sausage, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter how the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance to Germany in 25 years
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said gas imports were losing importance for Germany as the country continued its transition to decarbonization.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the question of gas transport to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to ensuring that Ukraine continues to transport Russian natural gas in the future, since at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement, which recorded the support of Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Burbock said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, as part of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline "does not yet comply with the regulations" of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

Hackers hacked the Twitter of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers have hacked India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Twitter account.
The intruders were able to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
The Modi office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister’s page was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the participation rate in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755) of New Caledonia's voters "in favor" of independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "no".
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the elections.
France-Presse commented on the interim results that “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt” as independence supporters urged voters not to take part in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed it on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for a third victory for supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As it was reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to address the outcome of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia’s independence has largely revived the last weeks of France’s presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have called for the territory to remain part of France, as it is “the last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific”.
“New Caledonia must necessarily remain French,” said Eric Zemmour.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position, “because it is not his responsibility.”
However, the president added, “France would have been less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France.”

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article on the relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that emanates from Moscow, and admitted a number of insulting remarks to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “show a united front against Russia.”
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quoted one of the readers as saying.
“Europe is not ours to ‘lose’ it, and Ukraine is not our land.
“The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine,” he said.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
The magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km north-east of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The fireplace lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Peru, which injured ten people.

Ukraine will start to produce a new generation of jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start to create unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of type ANKA.
This was reported on December 11 by the independent adviser of the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: a casing and the like," - quotes his Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jets, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass it "in all its characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve, the Ukrainian General Staff secreted data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the united forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenskyy, announced that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense concluded an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, in which personnel will be trained, as well as tests and maintenance of Turkish UAVs Bayraktar.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called the memorandum "a major real step forward".
At the airport two lions escaped from the container
In Singapore's Changi airport, lions fled.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were going.
One of the fleeing lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the safety net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of the employees of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all of Singapore’s zoos.
They immobilized the lions using darts with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion ran away from the owner and walked through the streets of the city.
On the same day the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warn of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research suggests that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less at risk of developing certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
A professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this figure in more or less ways.
Kitchen recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men after 50 years eat this fruit more often.
In the UK by April, about 75,000 people may die due to omicron-strain
Forecasts by British scientists show that the spread of the coronavirus micron-strain in the next five months in England could kill up to 75,000 people if restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, citing a study by experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the scientific and advisory group on emergencies under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 in the country will record at least 25,000 deaths due to the strain of microns, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease rates, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people every day.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from overloading if the micron-strain proves to be more contagious than the delta variant, and the current vaccines cannot rule out infection," said mathematician Rosanna L. Barrda.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency reported that if the rate of spread of the micron-strain remains at its current level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1,898 cases of coronavirus micron-strain infection have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the past 24 hours.
On 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

Superyacht demand grows by a quarter in the world
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of yachts ordered amounted to 1,200 - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of combating the effects of climate change on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for $50 million or more will not decrease, writes the Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there has been no such turmoil in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of contamination on land and prefer to hide from a pandemic aboard their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and the negotiations take place at a glance.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, life on yachts or flying on their own planes causes irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to take action and propose to introduce new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
In the meantime, it is impressive not only the number of ordered super-yachts, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a feed length of more than 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-metre-long REV Ocean yacht.
After being put on the water, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "lunar pool", as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On the existing super-yachts have become common sites for helicopters, cinemas under the open sky, and on some of them, such as the yacht fighter McGregor - a platform for martial arts.Professor of economic anthropology of the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilkes says that compared to the number of
But it has symbolic significance, given that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is a thousand times the footprint of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet’s biggest polluter Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail clung to his 162.5-metre-long Eclipse yacht.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and let the crew drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don’t sympathize with other people when they, like Australia’s richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that their giant ships have no place to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for boats 50 meters.
Determined a dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
The researchers concluded that consuming four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
The exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, scientists can not determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don’t realize how much four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to be sure to find out how the intellect of animals has developed.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as that of a human, a new study proves that the dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists’ work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can’t play chess or write poems, they don’t mean anything in politics, economics, and art, but they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding the words of human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet enough.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses - for example, labradors.
Scientists concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of their ability to learn, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepares for U.S. and Russia bidding
The United States and Russia will “trade” about Ukraine’s accession to NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for Glaudr.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on U.S. guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance in the near future, despite the words of U.S. leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "enter anywhere".
If you are offered something deliberately unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not start trading, but just send the offerer.
And with regard to Ukraine, a tender is planned," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparations are carried out in secret, quickly and immediately proceed to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to be detected and deployed by the forces of opposition," he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the US, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition, held in the city of Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, said Hou Zhaoweng, a spokesman for the company.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with this technology, which will ensure increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased rail vehicle exports and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing a “Chinese speed”.
In May this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. launched the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China for export to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will travel along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city airport.
The subway line will open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaosian, head of the Trade and Investment Department of China's Committee to Promote International Trade.
“This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese manufacturing of high-end equipment in the world market,” said Feng Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, conducting a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system of production of equipment for railway transport, with a full set of auxiliaries and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Golosheikin in a conversation with Radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the risk factors for it, the specialist said.
Golosheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of developing dementia will help to learn foreign languages and actively communicate.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with the help of games and hobbies that require intense memory involvement and thinking logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Holosheikin.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exercise, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic of thinking,” said Holosheikin.
Earlier, a charity for the study of dementia in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
The doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is called aphasia – a condition where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili is in need of psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, Otar Toidze, a neurologist who is part of a doctors' council set up under the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," - said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-nerve rehabilitation, a possibility that we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical care after the prison service personnel subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
Georgian policy quickly succeeded in repealing the punishment and restoring itself to its former rights.

Protests against COVID passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests took place against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for walking to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment.
Many protesters came to the scene without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for admission to entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the start of the pandemic, more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on unvaccinated people.
Bills on a single system of QR-codes were submitted by the government to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, public catering and retail with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or transmitted disease, or a medical withdrawal from vaccination.
The same rules will be set for travel on trains and planes.

A cool ascent: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow to raise President Xi Jinping's designated 1 trillion yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympics, is becoming more and more popular among Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping work is carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday at the Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become forever.
However, it is still a long way from that.
Games Advisor Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed to unrecognizability.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese people go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in the agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and to create the infrastructure necessary for recreation there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chongli, near the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was run from Beijing to Chongli, and now none of the locals are suffering from unemployment.
The country is opening more and more shops selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open points of common food with dishes of national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in the biggest international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty as a result of a pandemic, according to WHO
More than 500 million people around the world may be in extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity’s progress on universal access to health services, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage, on 12 December, WHO and the World Health Organization published two complementary reports.
In them, they found that the pandemic led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The WHO and the World Health Organization (WHO) stressed that the pandemic caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pockets.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has put more than 100 million people in poverty, more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwan’s minister was cut off from broadcasting at the “Democracy Summit” at the request of the White House
Taiwan’s digital minister Audrey Tan’s speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized “Democracy Summit” was translated into a no-video mode, the summit’s YouTube footage shows.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the image was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was distinguished by a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted green on it as "free", while the PRC, DPRK, Laos and Vietnam were highlighted red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the views of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. government."
China was not invited to the “Summit for Democracy”.
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister may have run counter to the “one-China” policy that Washington is adhering to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the U.S. National Security Council angryly contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized “Summit for Democracy” took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate summit, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".
You get the info, like they're cooking food, and there's brittle meat everywhere, in fact, meat until the last bit is left with the butcher.
The classic of journalism is to create news out of nothing.
They boil not meat, but horns and hoofs, obtaining a substance of the glue type.
The finished product looks like a yellow translucent strip almost odourless and solid, like plastic, used as a natural gelatin.
In general, the harmful substances from the recycling of waste are no less than from its decomposition.
This saves companies a lot of money.
Therefore, a fairy tale about ecology was invented for hunters, who will work on collecting garbage for free for the idea.
My personal contribution to ecology is to refuse to acquire unnecessary and long-term use of things.
If I go beyond that, I don't throw it away, I donate it to charity.

Don't go into one pile - there are bad people, you may have claims to them on a specific occasion...
But what about the number of children, age, pension fund and so on?
Write that they're "fuckers, they didn't get the money back."
But how many and when they have children, it is not your business until they gather these children to hang on your neck.
And if that is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
It's probably just in education so...
The chosen parents (they themselves) dictate their own rules, frankly ignoring the existing ones.
What if this applies to other areas of life, legal proceedings, etc.?

What if the pope still introduces his method of upbringing and education?

Those who arrive in cities where the land-based pass points are located must pass at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acids upon arrival.

The Foreign Ministry told about the "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long journey of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability exists, but in part, in some perspective of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey we have made with the current administration, with Trump and with Obama.
Problems did not begin yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose on Russia approaches on many issues.
Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects of improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, there was no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns about the danger of vaccination with nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may have allergies and need medical attention, so the first points for immunization with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, a correspondent member of the RAS, the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccine vaccination points at airports and shopping malls, but I would do it at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor's office afterwards.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally in a minute or two, which sometimes is very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it hits the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated person with a congestion of the nose fades after injection.

The Lamas say that true believers make up the church.

But no one should speak of himself, nor of those who believe as he does, that they are the true believers.
Because if they can say of themselves that they are truly believers, then the same can be said of others.

This is reported by Sky News.

The total number of COVID-19 patients from the new strain in the UK reached 3,137 people.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries, which are introducing anti-Russian sanctions
Russian President’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “invasion” of the territory of the country.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not to experience suffering on your own," the Kremlin spokesman said on Russia 1 television.
Peskov claims that this is “understood by everyone in the world.”
Earlier it was reported that the US is considering the imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions, which will aim to complicate the conversion of rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of the Sberbank, Herman Gref, is sure that this is not possible.

Residents of New Caledonia reject the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of the voters voted against independence.
Supported independence from France by 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results of 2.99% of the bulletins were cancelled.
The level of participation in the vote on that day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the sites.
According to experts, the low attendance is due to the calls of separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the location of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration that allows the region to hold a vote on its independence twice every two years.

WHO Preliminary Considers “Omicron” Less Dangerous Than “Delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has predicted that the micron is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines in the disease with the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on December 9, the "micron" is registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the omicron strain protein suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and variant transmission.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that the severity of the disease may be less severe than that of the delta, the WHO said in a technical report.
The organization notes that while all reported cases of infection with "omicron" in the EU are easy or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster "deltas".
In Russia, two cases of infection with omicron-stam.
They were “previously immunized,” the Gamalai Name Center reported.
The head of the Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that there is no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
Former Deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelenskyy in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state can remain without the support of the West, and may also go to compromises on the Donbass.
About this on Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told in a publication on the portal "Glawred".
The first option, which Denisenko called the "ideal storm", suggests that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"At the same time, there is a decrease in prices for key goods, which we traditionally export <0x3C>...> domestic protests and confrontation of the government with key FPGs (financial-industrial groups). " - added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will take place in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the Ukrainian leadership can make compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which a confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will be weakened, the probability of such a situation, according to the former deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third variant of the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of dissident Zelensky population groups and the president, due to which it is likely to seize control of the force block and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In the course of this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting power", Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the “father of the nation.”
This can lead to some event that will be a major shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a variant of the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technogenic catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any likelihood of an “attack” on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the data of the survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted that in the case of the upcoming elections of the President of Ukraine, Zelensky would give his vote only 21.8%, while for the former President of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
Among all the respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Arrested for the action on the Red Square poet: "For the quote of Yevtushenko 10 days give, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained in Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #PoetRussiaMostPoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
On Alexander was drawn up a protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of the procedure of holding a public event.
The first time he was detained on January 23 in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How did the police treat you during your arrest this time and before?
What did they ask in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time the staff were more correct, the detention as much as possible, polite, no matter how ridiculous it sounded in some context of the word.
At Pushkin, the OMOnovts took and took hard.
They asked me about the motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approving, then understanding.
With the exception of the four-sided monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if after the action under this hashtag begin to write their poems, at least a few people, I will not sit these 10 days in vain.

Researchers Tell How Potatoes Help Fight Age Disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help to function the body’s systems.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age disorders.
Due to the high content of gum, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use, it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root crop is better to chew or cook, rather than frying on oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other high-glycemic foods.
These are carbohydrate-containing foods that are quickly broken down into sugar, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal subsidiaries and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only replace imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the release of "Yandex"
Candidates for the Exit
In 2015, rights holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites of the runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazarian, general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to including a regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search edition of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirate copies of the Netflix series "Game in the Squid" and "Tenderness" of director Anna Melikian - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (included in AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search engine release, you can see the animation novelty "Encanto", but judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (the pirate copy of the film was shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, is available the series "Universe. 10 years later" TNT TV channel (included in "Gazprom-media").

Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimet, size 160x190
The orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimet.
The model is convenient in that it has two different surface softness – high hardness and slightly more than average.
The composition of the product includes only quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Spring: in the center of the model is installed a unit of independent springs "micropacket".
This means that the sleeping area has 2,000 spirals, which work completely autonomously.
It is their operation that gives a unique point adjustment.
"Micropack" is the most high-frequency of all the variety of "Dimax" spring blocks, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: at the top and bottom of the springs are installed combinations of layers of coriander and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut cork.
Such a tandem of fillers has long held the status of a classic, as it transmits to the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coriacea provides proper back support, then latex gives an adaptation of the surface under the human body.
Case: The model comes in a stretchy knitted case Aloe Vera.
At the request of the customer, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Current Camera said on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year missions is to assess the suitability for life of the Venus clouds, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Up until now, it had been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but Venus was probably originally a planet of the Earth type.
In the course of the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to the earth or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Paiusalu, head of the Estonian Venus Life Finder project team.

Metaspaces will change Russian business
The topic of metaspaces became popular this fall, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Thus, businesses in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaspaces and their subsequent monetization.
Meta-universes should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of division and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the business’s desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
With the third – they are a logical continuation of the asset digitization trend, when any rights, securities, artworks and even money go digital.

The British economist was not able to give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill has not been able to give a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts will turn into a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in the second place - inflation, he believes.
O’Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in prices for goods was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of endless central bank generosity has already outlived itself” and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies may, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising poverty and climate change, O'Neill summed up.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the Global Investment Opening Research Division, said that positive expectations for the dollar’s 2022 exchange rate remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Shulgin called the monetary policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country’s GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is leading.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars in the amount of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year ago.
The related Kia brand Hyundai has even more significant growth - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and in the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year, Hyundai grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of the increase was stronger only with Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow as much: according to statistics of the Committee of Automakers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes three leaders in sales volume in monetary terms Japanese Toyota - on cars of this brand the Russians spent in 10 months 275.5 billion rubles, which is 14% more than the year before.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand also increased sales volume (by 37%), and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz has at the same time seen a good growth in sales and a weighted average price – more, for example, than BMW – hence a greater increase in financial capacity,” said Tatiana Arabaji, CEO of NAPI.
At the pace of sales growth, the fantastic performance shows Chinese brands, which also significantly increased financial capacity this year.”
Russian Lada on the dynamics of the growth of income shows average market indicators (plus 28%), on cars of this brand Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles in 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose sales of cars in pieces in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and even less - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of automotive components and production disruptions, which covered the entire world auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of models Lada seven times a year, the last increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of the year.
Regularly rewrite prices on their products and other car manufacturers.
The volumes of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the car shortage, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of automotive companies to repay past losses, experts believe.
In a situation of car shortages, I think many automakers have even been able to partly shift the costs of past periods to the consumer, which they could not put into the price of cars before,
says analyst "VTB Capital" on the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov. -
I think that financially, automakers are feeling very well now, supporting high sales margins.”
Indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are rising faster than inflation, the expert specifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and complication of the design of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As the supply increases, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in the value of cars will slow, car manufacturers will be able to get their income at the expense of volumes, says the independent auto industry consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now car manufacturers are looking to get the most profit from each sold car, says Burgazliev.
The increase in the volume of production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the turmoil is further heated by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a mileage, now it is possible to sell more expensive than the initial value, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the transfer of U.S. military to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of a “invasion” of Russia.
The statement was made by U.S. President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," the White House chief said, responding to a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The U.S. leader also said that the possibility of using U.S. troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the US will transfer forces to the Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more US and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the spokesman of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he indicated that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of Turkish-provided drones by Kiev, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, such as an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another power structure, then immediately discard ineffectively, and put on a blacklist, most likely, will not have time.
