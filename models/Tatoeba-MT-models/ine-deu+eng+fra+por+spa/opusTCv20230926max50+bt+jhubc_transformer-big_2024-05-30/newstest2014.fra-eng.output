Spectacular wingsuit jumps over Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter on Thursday over Bogota, Colombia's capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many badauds had gathered to observe his exploits.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners are struggling to find the money needed to repair the decayed highway infrastructure, many are seeing a solution in the form of a small black box that sticks above the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record every mile driven by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and government planning offices to reshape the obsolete funding system for major U.S. roads.
The generally uninterested sector of major axis planning suddenly provoked a heated debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you’re traveling, and possibly the road you’re traveling on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress fail to agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental turn.
This is truly essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, director general of the Southern California Association of Governments, which predicts the state will begin recording the miles driven by each California driver by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded by the taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a pay-per-mile system.
“This turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long run,” he said.
Wonks calls this the cost of mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban liberals, as taxes could be used to change driving habits in a way that reduces congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said he also sees it as the most viable alternative in the long term.
Free market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of paying drivers a mile.
“It’s not just a tax hanging in a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also backed by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the pay-per-mile path.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that reportedly covered about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or to the city.
Nevertheless, many states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country’s most important experience.
These drivers will soon pay the state kilometre fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The City of New York is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with an aircraft, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their slightest facts and gestures.
“The concerns about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads the Nevada Department of Transportation’s Strategic Performance Management.
It's not something people want.
At the start of the trial, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full-fledged location devices.”
There is no need to build a huge and bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily walkways and walkways.
Nevada is one of the few states now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car is traveling, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to resort to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
It sought to drill into the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices it tests have appealed to big-axis planners because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
“People will be more likely to do that if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less costly ways and far less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering different choices to motorists.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a flat rate based on the average number of miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees, provide “pay-to-drive” insurance, and create a real-time speed dataset from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,” said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate about mileage is just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs at the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four unreleased songs
The British musician did not end up surprised this year.
Starting from The Next Day, released in January, he has concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased ones.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in slippers.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that one could still rely on him to sparkle the pop scene.
A party for his fans
Unsurprisingly, David Bowie had more than one turn in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke will re-release the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he has concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three albums: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four already unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe Edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both the discs, but also the accessories supplied with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, it gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and skillfully mastered rock electricity.
Unprecedented Listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a bright ride that gradually slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?
The enchanting guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth.
Bowie enjoys playing the chameleon with these titles: turn-by-turn informant, man aboard a rocket, potential Martian...
He conceals and reveals both, playing to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the Louis Vuitton Invitation to Travel campaign, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transitional process was being followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and the New Democrats in the House of Commons, Nicholson assured that before their release, the members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the army's "universality of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including one of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario with post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the military despite his request to stay for another year in order to receive a fully indexed pension.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can grant to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under the current rules, severely wounded soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required service period to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal spokesman for former fighters Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for Corporal Hawkins' reintegration, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Disney puts on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to prefer the tablets to its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie’s Wild West will be available from November 24 at watchdisneyjunior.com or via its phone and tablet app.
Its worldwide launch on Disney Group channels is only planned for 2014, according to the statement from its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the pussy Callie, sheriff of a city in the west of America where she makes the order reign with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience comes as part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of under-two-year-olds have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of under-eight-year-olds, compared with 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
U.S. intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he enjoys the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has obviously been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will make this possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to the test following complaints that the NSA had wiretapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Snowden as a witness “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States,” one should take advantage.
Mr. Ströbele, a German Green MP, posted a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have judged the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public utility.
The letter proposes cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix on-demand video service via their TV in a future that doesn’t seem so far away.
Cogeco’s subsidiary said on Thursday it was currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus takes the lead with its competitors, such as Bell, although the subsidiary of Cogeco has not yet a precise date in terms of this new platform.
"We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail," Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable distributors so that its service is available through their streaming platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during its Throne Speech on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the ability to pay for services at the card.
“It’s been about two and a half years since we’ve been saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy major chain packages doesn’t work,” Audet said.
He hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will result in interesting recommendations.
"There will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new benchmark to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," said Cogeco CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
In terms of results, Cogeco reported a net profit of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or <0xC2><0xA2>82 per share.
This represents a decrease from net profit of $44.9 million, or <0xC2><0xA2>83 per share, for the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline in depreciation costs associated with new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the US-based Atlantic Broadband cable distributor in 2012 for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet service provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
Cogeco’s revenue grew 41.5 percent in the fourth quarter to $504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was $43.9 million, or <0xC2><0xA2>90 per share, down from $45.7 million, or <0xC2><0xA2>93 per share, from the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable’s revenues, however, increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Cable is up 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about the number of customers fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very fierce competition.
From horse in products to beef
Horse meat has been detected in canned beef products, sold by two small UK retailers at low prices, the food hygiene agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained horse DNA at a level of 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on road 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic had returned to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them on the descent of the plane.
The new baggage allowance applies to bags placed in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was intended to encourage travelers to pay the fee in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she explained.
The airlines began paying for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these costs put as much as they could in hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in those compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers carry less stuff on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
It’s about making the most loyal Frontier customers understand that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Border boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers are aware of these charges before arriving at the door.
Frontier hand baggage charges will not apply until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other expenses, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are high and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people in Wall Street view the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are paying high enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Yet many of them did not touch the baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed suit a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit’s hand baggage charge was $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the airline's unusual hand luggage charges.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth crunching and a fight burst at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "passengers boarded at lightning speed."
Frontier also does like Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the can unopened with them, and those who take coffee can be booked for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to pay for drinks in 2008 but went back seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline had followed suit.
Frontier’s decision to charge a hand baggage charge when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced mileage bonuses by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile Frontier travel purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly from the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown of Denver, but her business is back and she loses money.
Revenue fell 9% and its flying capacity decreased nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to straighten Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an “internal error” and not hackers for the failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that caused the malfunction of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers as some had claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can’t access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the crash of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber-tactical is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The once-ultra-secret NSA, once called the “No Such Agency,” has come under the spotlight and has been heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programs at home and abroad – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the NSA.
This growing controversy around the agency has provoked a lot of speculation that the incident tonight was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-City now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, we met the employees individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” explains Delta Hotels Regional Director of Work Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else, and that's what happened," said Paul Arsenault, who holds the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza, which will become a retirement home.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be launched in two years.
Titan CEO Says Goodyear Amiens Purchase Project Starts With Zero Employees
After throwing the sponge with failures in January for the partial takeover of the Amiens-Nord Goodyear site promised to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the American tire Titan, declares, today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced this on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plant’s purchase plan in January, you’re back today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of “so-called workers” who “work three hours” a day, of “crazy” unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of taxation and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours disabled France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
I have no prejudices against France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with the right price and competent workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the plant’s closure, Goodyear had offered employees a good start-up allowance, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
As a result, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
Now, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from Goodyear’s approximately 1,200 current employees.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for CGT and Goodyear to sign a severance agreement for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Can you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting compensation.
If all employees accept them, the factory purchase project starts with zero employee.
How can we give job duration guarantees when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we plan to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier Profit Drops as Aircraft Deliveries and Orders Drop
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a drop in orders and aircraft deliveries during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not provide in-flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule before next September.
After the initial flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, the test plane flew only three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not in line with forecasts and the stock price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday, moving from “overperformance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential for the stock to rise over the next quarter or two quarters.
“While the drop in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,” Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe that Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential for savings of the new airliner.
At present, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 firm orders before the commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was advancing according to the schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft’s downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to do a first flight and plan an update period, and that's what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes is expected to take off in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the start-up schedule and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slowness in flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.

Two 23-year-old and 27-year-old speleologists have been missing in a hole under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, it was learned Friday from the Isère Rescue Speleo.
They were spotted this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one hard-working and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
There has been no news of them since then, the same source said.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Rescue Speleo in charge of organizing the rescues.
Dozens of people on the ground
About twenty rescuers, ten civilians members of the French Rescue Spéléo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They got lost in the network, returned to their feet while awaiting rescue, the prefecture said.
Recharged, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday urged its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services the day after further revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging until further notice,” she said in a statement.
She finds Washington Post reports "scandalous" that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected massive amounts of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, chairman of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
Fires painted: MP demands resignation of Brigitte Grouvels
Minister Brigitte Grouvels’ project to “relift” the posts of the traffic lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched on Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 poles of signaling lights in the yellow and blue colors of the Brussels region.
The aim is to "increase both security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights, for an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who talks about the "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend the money of Brusselsers madly in operations of relifting the signposts to the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouvels continues her operations of flamandizing the Capital," said De Bock in a statement.
After her yellow-manga-black taxis, she finally painted herself in dark blue-yellow-black the poles of Brussels.
According to the MP, there is now "no longer a difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
Brusselsers deserve better than to see their money wasted by a minister of CD&V who is carrying out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan Horse of Flanders.
"Brigitte Grouwels was elected with only 2,245 votes or 0.5% of Brusselsers!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the Portico de Pont - de - Buis dismantled
The portico ecotax of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national highway was diverted in the aftermath.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the Finistère prefecture on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax porticoes that can operate in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers who own a prototype of Google’s signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a headphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of microfibers or an intra-ear headset.
While Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction lenses, no large-scale release date has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father got rid of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn’t know how I was going to keep “frequenting” it.
There is no recipe, no manual to pass through the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that’s what I thought the day I found her body empty, criss-crossed on that hospital bed with the crumpled sheets.
Likewise, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the thin glow of the candles that would frame his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small day or night appearances, a little timid, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she took her place in the landscape of my thought which believed itself to be in mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother’s person at all, but simply a woman I didn’t really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
In dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside as well as outside," he says.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a tough relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He spoke to me, encouraged me constantly, inhabited my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me with my privacy.
It took a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don’t know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer there, but I feel them close to me all the time.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it’s too late, but there’s always one thing that keeps me from fulfilling that moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and are part of my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I needed to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was lifting myself out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he was smiling and happy that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to signify that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I am delighted to tell this common memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
I realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I’m in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and being interested in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a large school, were not, with the backwardness, anodin choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades – before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so much so that I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be up to the generosity and uprightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, tears that go off on their own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then, time eased the pain.
All that remained was the lack, the emptiness without answer, the need for her to confide in me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there, looking at me.
Every morning, I see his restless eyes resting on me, I see the hues that weigh down his gaze, the wrinkles around his lips that pierce the cigarettes, the folds that mark the forehead on the days of restlessness.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We are constantly feeling its protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually relearned to smile, and to pronounce his name is no longer a taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the depths of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the moral is a bit reached.
We feel carried and protected in the difficult moments, the backwardness of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay in the path she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot tear it from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted on what he thought or appreciated.
I couldn't attend his funeral and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don’t know if I adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's here on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It has been almost 30 years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old.
The immense pain that then overwhelmed me has, of course, been mitigated, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "lands" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that on awakening I am even more sad to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in shock, anxious and turned on the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that he was going to arrive.
I still live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I turn to see if he is not there, I know it is him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants U.S. aid.
“We don’t tell the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” Maliki said in Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what’s happening in Iraq isn’t resolved, it’s going to spread, and what’s happening in Syria is going to spread too.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They brandished signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation has been arrested
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Court of Appeals
A top defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug trafficking activities after compromising himself because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed “Bash” and considered by criminals as a “first-rate case,” was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug-trafficking trial.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, as he was attending a bar dinner with fellow lawyers.
Investigations have revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, her wallet and her credit cards.
Over an eight-month period from January to August 2011, he illegally sought information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then under police surveillance as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking taking place in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction would be exposed to the public.
Ditta, who works for the Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors law firm, has fallen into disgrace after being convicted of two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted to possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing the drugs, pure to 60%, under the lawyer's garbage in a black golf glove.
Shortly after depositing, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, the Blackburn Rovers' club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug, and they called each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, her wallet and her credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied cocaine use, saying he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a “legal privilege”.
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that there were occasions when clients called him home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling for major actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If anyone needs to know that you shouldn’t break the law, it’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of engaging too much with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying the drug to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications as he was his lawyer.
But this has gone far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
It hindered the police investigation as much as it could to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said, “Mr. Ditta has gone from criminal to criminal lawyer himself since he started acquiring drugs from criminal organizations.”
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the backward thinking of members of organized criminal groups who charged him with obtaining valuable information regarding police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest integrity rules and establish a climate of public trust.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted an investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of all three charges of cocaine possession and now obstructing justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer session on himself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death corridor in America, his last guest at dinner would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin to return to the stage in December
The Detroit News reports that the soul queen will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board Room of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
In November, Mrs. Franklin went on to record an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, Respect's famous interpreter told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She said she was “happy to be back.”
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers of seashore covered with a coat of light: one could fry the heat in Menton with the lighting bill.
An invoice that, unlike many municipalities, is also settled by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To alleviate its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
He was an employee of the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Very soon police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it will be the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five saynets imagined and performed by artists from the region, cartoons with a high dose of humor, allow teenagers to master classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyric Art of the Kingdom will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now makes room full of the Pulperia de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving the chance to artists in the region to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apero lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the competition of the soprano Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger.
It was a for-profit activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as a bat's air.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future is well planned, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
“The finances are floating and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step we will take in seven years,” the administrator said.
“I’d even say beyond that,” added the CEO, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Surrey's Gabrielle Roy School faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Mustapha Hassan was accused of taking hostages, seizing, uttering threats, carrying weapons in a dangerous design, abduction, and failing to comply with an order.
“The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident,” said Corporal Bert Paquet in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective appeal against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new collective appeal was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that were reported to have taken place this time in the oratory of Saint-Joseph as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", who was masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his brother Submis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a priest.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us: "I, I was at such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has the particularity of allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where abuses could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also underlines that the Congregation of Sainte-Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exerted a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims" and that they "have sexually abused and sexually abused the victims".
These latest allegations are based, among other things, on letters written by Sainte-Croix brothers' lawyer, Mr. Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility to the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage, i.e. the substantive hearings, is carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a trade in the district of LaSalle, in Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
Rescue services were called at around 1:00 a.m. on Friday due to a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were sent to the site took nearly an hour to control the fire.
The fire caused "significant damage to the structure of the building", said the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty homes, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, as residents of one of the apartments may need to be temporarily housed, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical aid dying in the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would want to end their days, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus were on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Réseau des soins palliatifs du Québec also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance’s vice president of palliative care homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes the Quebec Bill is disorienting the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will take the lead.
Gatineau’s Liberal MP, Stéphanie Vallée, said the notion of the end of life would have to be clarified before the bill was passed.
Kenyan Press Aggrieved by Controversial Media Law
“This is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?” the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court "will always be partial because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament,” he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have “the grip on the media.” The Standard, meanwhile, said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “had suffered a hard blow” and whipped the bill calling it “draconian”.
The bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate shopping mall last September.
Kenyan media angered the authorities by broadcasting footage of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly robbed the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interrogate them, although the summons was withdrawn following a hike of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, media outlets could face fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists of up to 1 million with the added risk of being “deleteed” or no longer able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize an offender's property if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do what they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering.”
Kenyan legislators have been the target of people’s anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their spiraling wages of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-exempt – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) de Laval caused a lot of emotion to the management of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Santé, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department found itself severely staffed.
It lacked nearly 30% of the necessary staff, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We did not resort to troubleshooting, Mrs Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or diminished for as long as things change.
Of course we worked hard to get our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There's a circumstance contest that put us in a bad situation last year.
Enhanced situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back at work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's retention efforts have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain in employment with the CSSS.
Now it’s getting much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will complete our departures from last year.
Always Growing Needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or the prevalence of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always ride three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists available to do replacements, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old top model doesn’t start her film career with a small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a 40-year-old addicted to sex since her teenage years.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her eldest is striking: a silhouette of twigs, a diaphane complexion and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay naked on iced paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the Canvas: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he had recourse to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing her actresses into their final cuts, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated on Thursday evening
Thursday night, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling in the throat felt by spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility evacuated the room and alerted firefighters to a suspicious odor.
Approximately 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a complete recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on a tear jet background?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is always that the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients thoroughly.
The room was ventilated and everything went in order.
The cinema has been able to regain its rights and customers find the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to bring in two kilograms of cocaine hidden in pumpkins at Montreal-Trudeau airport on Thursday morning.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug was detected.
The cocaine had been divided into three pumpkins that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said CBSA spokeswoman Jacqueline Roby.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border guards at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 seizures of drugs, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, Border Services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1,653 seizures of narcotic drugs.
Air raid on military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A short-range SA-8 ground-to-air missile cargo was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new ISIS air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont ground-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy.
Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, calling into question the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to cope with its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It comes with a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances of it being lowered again within a year.
“The government’s strategy is less and less likely to guarantee enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of loans taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities have massively used to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency increasingly judges a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of failing to pay a $882 million bill.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had undergone its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been asking for months for assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it a loan of $ 15.3 billion in 2010 and has so far unlocked only $ 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "important external financing needs" constituted "a vulnerability", while at the same time showing "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Centre for Political Studies, "there is no short-term improvement to be expected."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the expert told AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditionals on the release of opponent Yulia Timochenko.
“Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia’s reaction,” S&P said, fearing “trade restrictions” on Moscow’s part.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
Green light from the United States at the merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objections from the U.S. authorities to their merger, bringing them closer to the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the previously announced merger review period of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a statement.
They also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions necessary for the execution of the transaction.
“The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory approvals and approval from the shareholders of both groups,” they add.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would chase the M23 rebels to their bases located in the forests and mountains of the bordering North Kivu of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of being defeated after being driven from localities in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) it controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.
"We will prosecute M23 and harass it wherever it hides because they are criminals," FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not allow them to reorganize themselves because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace back.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would in no way change his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Hangings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last insurgent town to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion originated in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the government garrison's flight and the passivity of the Monusco blue helmets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawi and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was redesigned and the army moved on to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” said Congolese business expert Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - it would be the first time the government of Kinshasa has succeeded in defeating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which fervently denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, formed from former Congolese mutiny.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman announced.
Last week, Kigali had mentioned the possibility of military retaliation for the shells that fell on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, residents of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be liberated by the army one day," a resident of this neighbouring Ugandan town testifies.
"We lived in terror (from M23), we are traumatized," he added.
Tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus turned out to be negative, the ministry of health announced.
“The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date.”
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being affected after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported a decline in its quarterly profit on Friday due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining at a standstill compared to the group's targets.
Its third-quarter net profit fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpd for this year, with an expected 25% increase in production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment spending has increased by $7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a decline in net profit on Thursday, despite an increase in its gas and oil production.
School Transportation: Complaint deemed admissible
The School Board of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) requires a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) from the beginning of the school year for students receiving two-residence school transportation, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediate and asked for an additional time to reflect.
"It is always better to talk about it, to work together and to find solutions," says Lefèvre.
The School Board of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-Dieu emergency rooms
In the face of the several months of controversy by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to "delay the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that will not be able to intervene on November 4.
An official request made "to take no risk on taking care of the emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but which also aimed to not hinder the PS's campaign a few months away from the municipales.
Despite ministerial orders, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if, in the APHP, the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of 4 November, the firefighters who were responsible for about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency services at the Hôtel-Dieu will all have been instructed to take about 30 serious cases per day to the emergency services of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, emergency internees will leave room for five general medicine internees on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The emergency room of the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4th," said Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Capron, president of the APHP Medical Establishment Commission (CME), who supports the management's project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he said, citing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain in place, he said.
But it is up to the SRA to decide on the closure of the emergency room.
"Things are going on gradually," says Nicolas Péju, a spokesman for the ARS, for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
“The minister lied to us or we lied to her,” says emergency physician Gerald Kierzek.
Resigned from his position as head of the SMUR at the beginning of July for having led the frond against the reorganization project, he defines himself as an "alert launcher" in the face of a "cynical" decision made by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
"They're emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he said.
"If the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly engrossed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting for the Lariboisière emergencies.
The ARS argues that thirty patients "dispatched" to several sites are not at risk of representing an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP are advocating the "new hospital model" already launched since 7 October and which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to participate in the implementation of an "ambulatory care continuity".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose," asks Gerald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of non-serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to be like level 3 maternity.
People aren’t crazy, they’re going to go where there’s the best care available.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the handlebars, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency physician and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP adviser from Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the UMP in Paris was for the maintenance of the emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibility".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, again reminded France Inter on Monday morning that she had voted in favor of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, she would mark her clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama ends eavesdropping on IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to take back control of the NSA's eavesdropping case after revelations by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Asked about the matter, a US administration official replied: “The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered the practice to be stopped over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as that ending the hearings at UN Headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission on Thursday approved a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission imposed new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “overstep national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process to set Universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique’s founding president, as they coughed, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment firm.
Worried about her country’s future, she traded her work clothes for a tee-shirt bearing the inscription “we want security” in Portuguese before joining the crowds crowded in the capital’s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst hangovers since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-run Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale do Brasil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko- USA.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo reject each other’s responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo bastion, on October 17.
The assaults on former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo’s spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the conflict, and accusing it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who wanted to use “all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.”
The Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
“It’s two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep fighting,” said Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and Mozambique specialist.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott municipal elections due in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes collected by Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to gain more votes in the elections.
Mazanga said Guebuza – who is due to step down at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has conducted disruptive lightning strikes on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the landings took place in Sofala province, several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal, is located.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railroad for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want peace back, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
It would be necessary to teach myths and legends to children as “models of lifestyle,” says the author.
Thor's Legend may show that "brutal force does not weigh against subtle ruse", while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "meticulous selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes children “completely defeat” messages being “sublimated” into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
An armed Hamas fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have said.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they fired a shell from an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA espionage: U.S. has "goed too far", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in terms of espionage, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged, in Washington’s first confession in the midst of controversy with Europe over the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the U.S. and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA’s interception of communications and data in Europe.
“In some cases, I admit to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure this doesn’t happen again in the future,” Kerry said at a conference in London that he attended from Washington on Thursday, October 31 via video link.
In his broadcast address, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of the US diplomacy has long justified the practices of intelligence and information gathering by the necessary counter-terrorism fight and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since thwarted many plans of attacks, through the interception of communications and the collection of information.
“We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects ahead of time,” he said.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, “I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.”
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately," the secretary of state admitted, who had already had to comment on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said on Thursday night that President Obama was “determined to try to clarify and that he is reviewing these practices so that no one feels wrong.”
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The paper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program, dubbed "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by internet giants.
According to one document, some 181 million items had been collected in January alone – ranging from metadata on emails, text items, or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and its leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed the U.S. president was unaware of such eavesdropping, Barack Obama refused to comment on the matter, citing national security.
On the other hand, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services who allegedly seized these communications, before supplying them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and it would absolutely not target Europe, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia summoned the ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also stirred China's anger.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its asset master, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the Ligue 1 club in a statement.
PSG, leader of the league against Monaco in the difference of goals, broadcast the list of players retained for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is "bleached", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from left knee inflammation at the time of his return from selection, at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated dead
At 11 a.m., Father Lachaise’s Crematorium organizes a secular ceremony in memory of all the cremated dead in his institution during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the mayor of Paris, must attend and then explain her funeral proposals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funerals of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they are unlucky to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which refers to the "delete of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Appreciating Death.
It has only been tolerated by the Catholic Church since 1963, which has limited attempts to appease it.
To appease cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would be entitled with an funeral.
Ipsos’ annual survey shows a strong commitment to organizing the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, doing nothing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the handing over of the ashes," observes Michaud-Nerard.
70% of the institutions now propose masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to connect him to others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize the farewell.
This has been the case at Father Lachaise’s crematorium since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
In this context, Father Lachaise’s crematorium has been organizing, since 2010, on the day of Toussaint, several commemoration ceremonies, both secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of those who have been cremated in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, relocation due to rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their ground floor apartment in the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
Given the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office, proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken an exaggerated proportion, says Jo<0xC3><0xAB>l Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in cities.
The de-ratification company carries out two passes a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not roam the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, derailment products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a child.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," defends the father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon out of money and we are waiting for a new home, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing stats.
The exchange rate has suffered from the dollar's decline against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning about its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house on fire in Old Quebec City
A fire that started on Friday afternoon in Vieux-Québec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames were declared in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms went off, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," said France Loiselle, a spokesman for Quebec's fire department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that the city of New York is where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremonial master at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly in front of the audience, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was taken up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of the headlines emerged at the Carolines, and they were a big hit, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue to work with them.
This year’s event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes,” a comedy and music evening for veterans at Madison Square Garden, which will feature Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Co Waters and Bill.
The festival has grown in size, just like the world of comedy.
Many of the actors participating in this year’s festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, such as performing on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance in front of the stage in a cable sitcom ("The League" on the theme of FXX's happily lascivious fantasy football) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the Saturday Night Live show and was part of the cast of the Parks and Recreation series, but she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other young comedians with a singular voice (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the City Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedic DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would go down an alley between two buildings and say, Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
Oil price continues to fall and approaches $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of inventories offset a report showing that China's greedy electricity manufacturing sector is growing stronger.
The U.S. benchmark crude price for delivery in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had risen by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, which show a growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth bounced back to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been seen for two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 the barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
The Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas has reinstated certain restrictions on the right to voluntary interruption of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The ruling by the Court of Appeal means that doctors practicing IVGs will need to have a "privilege of admission" from local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his or her status as a member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to issue a diagnosis or treatment there.
Defenders of the IVG argue that the contents of the law could result in the immediate closure of one-third of state clinics because these clinics failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge ruled on the eve of the law’s entry into force that the provisions dealing with the admissions privilege were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who is contesting the governorship, has asked the appeals court to override the first-instance judgment that blocked the law’s enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has achieved an audience-side return, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6 percent of the audience.
But was the show on the date?
Approximately 10,000 candidates presented to the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the pervert André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored in this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows spawn a wide selection of singers on the go, for the better and sometimes for the worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, a few have found their account.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of a successful singer are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD's control and search policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to appoint an overseer to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on Tuesday regarding the request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal said the judge must be dismissed from the case because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the court's criticism of the case.
The judge ruled that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
She appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and ordered a pilot program to test body-bearing cameras in neighborhoods where most controls take place.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the city's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and search has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest level in 2011 with 684,330 checks that concerned mainly black men of Hispanic origin.
A lawsuit was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's control and search program say they will end unfair practices, enable more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, would represent a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police personnel have been greatly reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that she was not ending the constitutional control and search practices, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Renters must go to vote, as each of them pay an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us $100,000 in fireworks, $4 million to $5 million in land in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysee
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysian kitchens as committed after working in embassies, the chef climbed all the steps until becoming a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and fed an incalculable number of world leaders in a quasi-anonymity that he breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years old.
The man with the face open, skull stripped and glasses of intellectual, born on October 24, 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin is holder of a pastry CAP.
Her mother herself was a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I've passed from one castle to the other!" ironizes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the mania of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus,” he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysee!
It displeases heads of state who showed a relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all greedy", gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific regime demands".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysee: you have to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now-former chef of the Elysée, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch to the heart.
He said compliments.
“His human side has emerged,” he says.
The chef will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been on the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in Old Quebec on Friday noon.
The four-story building, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms from the fire department.
The fire broke out at the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokeswoman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The burning house was home to four homes, but no tenants were on the spot at the time of the fire.
Damage has been limited, even if the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sapeurs have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Second Trailer Released
Martin Scorsese misses a few images from his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to cut you off in his role as a furious trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a “Long Island stock exchange courtier who refuses to collaborate with authorities in a vast Wall Street corruption case.”
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort sets up a scam that will make him a rich, very wealthy man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, man chains parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seem to have found the magic that brought them together in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its too long mounting.
It seems that the film lasts 2h45.
On December 25, he will be able to compete in the Oscars.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a barren pipe on a link involving then-exercise Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was in a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her “pretty special counselor.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, with hacking Pawlby’s voice box and “permanently planting in front of his door,” but Coulson also called and left him voice messages.
“The indictment suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stand in front of people’s houses hoping to surprise them, it’s the kind of man to like to present the story to people to see what they’re saying about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects: phone piracy, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, there can be no other way.
But what about the first one?
Is he aware of phone piracy?
He says otherwise, but we say “Of course it is.”
Rumors about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW’s editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she had been told, “Don’t waste your time with her, she’s with Charles.”
A tape, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures of the private investigator’s computer that involved Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a “Projects” file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about her, Edis added.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Ms. Pawlby's minor acts and gestures.
In a voicemail he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to tell Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to phone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister in the midst of violence
The U.S. president was due to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of U.S. help to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations reports an even higher record with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
These violences are becoming more and more deadly despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence has led to fears of another escalation as neighboring Syria is in the grip of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has fostered this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the deaths of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five trapped cars north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri al-Maliki wants a “world war” against al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the center of US Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki’s talks, which will be hosted by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise of ending military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and congressional elected officials.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a “third world war” against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uighur group of attack in Tiananmen
China’s Homeland Security chief on Friday accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, fell on the crowds that stood on the famous square of the Chinese capital, symbolizing the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security, accused the East Turkestan Islamic Movement of instigating the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there, driven by independentist claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV.
“The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in East Turkestan,” he added, his remarks being taken up by the new China agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle, whose name suggests he is of Uyghur origin, and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained petrol-filled containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement in East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probe on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has begun conducting a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each National Conference of Bishops, with the aim of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter", an independent Catholic newspaper of the United States.
A spokeswoman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the UK, bishops have published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: the army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The M23's irreducibles, a few hundred fighters, were pulled down at nearly 2,000 metres on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunangana and Jomba, two towns about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba told AFP, joined by phone at about 12:30, and said a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a bit," he added, "it seems that the FARDC armed forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a bit."
According to the witness, who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "stayed the night" in Jomba before heading to the front for a "raid operation".
There were cries fed with light weapons very clearly behind him.
From Bunagana, a political fiefdom and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting entered "a final phase," with the FARDC having "surrounded the remaining M23 positions to dislodge them."
Since Friday's resumption of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco has not directly participated in the fighting, but it provides decisive support to government troops in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.
By the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well-stocked with ammunition, were climbing towards the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, civilian-assisted soldiers loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a flaming new FARDC truck, to ensure the follow-up of another machine firing M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday called on the rebels once again to "demobilize voluntarily" under penalty of being disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without a result for now.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it is only up to the Ugandan mediation to arrange the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the return movement to the DRC that started in the morning reversed at midday.
"This morning we crossed to go to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back, told AFP.
We have the impression that the shootings are getting closer to the population.
In the early evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions sung and danced take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical asserts itself as a genre of success.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's rock opera, most attempts were ridiculous.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables carried the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the face.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles like successful tubes.
The first takes up, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the global creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On other stages, musical shows such as "1789", "lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" come to the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comédies musicales" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard conquered.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The supply has multiplied.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve at the will of the producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year backward leap under the pretext that you can serve pretty much anything when you have Matt Pokora at the top of the poster.
Afterwards, we have the musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that bring us back to the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like "Rent", "The Spider Woman's Kiss" or "The Awakening of Spring" are hard to fund.
Do we have enough artists capable as on Broadway of singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, tours, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as consequential as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
It is these same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful (often talented) young men at the head of a musical show is the assurance of the enthusiasm of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are cleverly maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
Mayonnaise is made in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
Gravely injured in crash with ghost driver on Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning at around 5:30 a.m. on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is harmless.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9 a.m., at the site of the accident, while the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation caused little traffic jams as the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be deflected by this exit/entrance of the ring.
A child seriously injured at an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His life prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It has been closed until further notice.
DRC: the army is preparing a new assault
Children are playing on a coal-fired armored vehicle that belonged to M23 rebels in Kibumba, eastern DRC, on October 31, 2013.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last rebel strongholds of the M23 near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on her own.
There will only be Runyonyi Hill.
"The one in Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fiefdom and last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23, are cut off at nearly 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting Thursday throughout the day said the situation had been "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fighting on the eve and were buried.
One girl was wounded by a bullet, and three other people were injured, including one seriously evacuated by the FARDC, the witness added.
Since the resumption of the fighting between the FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, the two fighters have not reported any casualties.
NSA revelations heighten corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower-turned-consultant, began unveiling his inexhaustible treasury of information on U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have sparked more than ever corporate paranoia about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the U.S. poses as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, nothing to date indicates that the United States has passed on industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament said that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“This is not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations has been a shock to some companies who previously thought China represented the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-U.S. members have given up their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There have always been.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, Managing Director of the chemicals company BASF.
Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally unwilling to disclose the preventive measures they have put in place, in case that would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long hammered the message that it is at least reckless to retrieve a free USB drive at a business show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says collecting mobile phones before board meetings so they can’t be used as remote listening devices has been a common practice for years.
The German BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the risk of impairing the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warned in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies about the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) in February cited France, Russia and Israel as second-degree culprits for hacking economic intelligence behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a Georgian teenager, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a wrestling carpet rolled in his high school gymnasium, think their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on Jan. 11 stuck in a carpet standing behind the courtyards of his high school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff’s Investigators have concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old’s family disputes these findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the Sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these findings were provided for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a cardboard box and they gave it back to them in a mortuary bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of “positional asphyxiation.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers any evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office representative was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage that investigators had examined.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues to the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from food allergies.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among faculty and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the most commonly used EpiPen branded self-injector – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
Legislative assemblies of States recently updated regulations to allow schools to have epinephrine in stock more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “I feel like something is biting my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling on my tongue.”
The NSA case highlights the total absence of a debate on intelligence
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which, on the one hand, blurs itself in public by summoning the US ambassador on October 21, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on board Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of U.S. surveillance over all communications in France.
Isn’t it surprising to read in the world’s columns a few weeks apart the reproduction of U.S. diplomatic correspondence on the one hand and a condemnation of the NSA’s listening to Quai d’Orsay on the other?
Wouldn't it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on US diplomacy’s analysis of political or other issues around the world, we indeed consider that, in the eyes of US power, this constitutes an important enlightenment.
When we describe American systems of interception against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to indignate us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The establishment of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, for the last ten years has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, in particular, France and the United States have established procedures for cooperation and for the exchange of information on a quasi-daily basis, which are described as essential on both sides.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and in return - it has already been said quickly - Americans can give information to French people about other regions of the world.
So the substantive question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to provide themselves with interception tools, as the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially within parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of violations of freedoms.
What is the real danger of the United States degrading its image?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk posed by Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US providers subject to U.S. law, and thus to the grip of the NSA.
Lastly, the vast movement of revelations undertaken by the media around the world, which is helping to spark a debate on intelligence surveillance practices that have hitherto been virtually non-existent, could push lawmakers, including the US, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly attributed to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child’s sex, allowing them to enter an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the Act was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infant, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and bruised.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersexuality being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term describing people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sexual identification specialist, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but that’s not the case with most children,” he added.
It is possible to do a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It’s like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as the other one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual traits (such as muscle mass, hairiness, breast and stature), primary sexual traits (such as reproductive and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-compliant gender now have camps specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to include male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeals lawsuit that allowed her to keep an "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will include a third designation alongside M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this largely Catholic country signed a petition for the “gender theory” to be removed from schoolbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also opposed the German law, writing that “since the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overturned.”
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also told Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be assigned to babies at birth.
“The role of parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s sex,” she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community regarded gender as a slate, which can be erased and redesigned.
But now, many are questioning the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their sexual reassignment when they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was put forward by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender malleable.
He dedicated the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals—the way parents raise a child—interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a crooked circumcision to castrate him completely, also removing his testicles, and raising him like a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say “[that] they are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he found out horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to grow.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and having his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labelling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an ‘indeterminate’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female gender, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
German law deals with the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should be fighting at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammogram radiologist in Pittsburgh whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said German law will “account for” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
At the age of 29, Katie is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law leaves some latitude to parents so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to take some tests and understand them, and a time limit before entering “male” or “female”.
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don’t have to rush into an operation that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite strong tensions between the left and right in the ruling coalition as the Senate vote to dismiss Silvio Berlusconi from office.
In an interview with La Stampa newspaper, the centre-left leader said he had "firmly intending" to continue to rule with his coalition until the upcoming 2015 parliamentary elections.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former president of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his impeachment.
But part of his party, grouped around the national secretary of the People's Liberty (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2nd his refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi, who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunshots.
Firefighters called at the scene said they had responded to a call claiming "multiple wounded".
"Police are on the scene," the airport said on Twitter, as images from the televisions showed people evacuated in ambulances.
“There was a shooting,” a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
The local ABC antenna showed a person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm immediately whether one of its employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli Army Kills Hamas Member in Gaza Strip
Israeli tank fire killed a Palestinian Hamas militant on Thursday and severely wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, health services sources said.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in the area because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli military has merely evoked a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel classified as a "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and the discovery of which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's Campaign Considered Dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have considered, in the greatest secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event featured in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s highly anticipated 2012 campaign book, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and said Thursday night that the president's close associates had conducted "in-depth group work and late-2011 polls" to see if Biden's eviction could help Obama for his re-election as his hopes were dwindling.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, former White House secretary general Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the vice president by former secretary of state Clinton could have on the president.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the Chicago Campaign Headquarters and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before ultimately deciding against the change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president wasn’t in shape, so we were like, “Lord, what can we do?”
While Daley called the review "concerted," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was reviewing the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible overhaul.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of the possible change, the former secretary-general admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's eviction from the presidential list was being considered.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Would you like a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the glossy protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to gleam when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” said: “It’s something incredible but we’re just in the beginning in terms of production, and 2 grams of this stuff costs about <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice begins to shine.
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice I’ve created because jellyfish luminescence is worth four times as much as gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes pretty good!
The company at Charlie’s experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation sounds even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed Died During a Tai Chi Session
Singer Lou Reed died while practicing tai chi, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" aimed at residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his hands of musicians slitting the air," Anderson writes.
Lou Reed was a master of tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even though we are citizens, it is our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had.”
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I've gotten more pink.
For the last two years, I haven't distributed a single candy and I certainly won't do it any more this year.
But stats show that I'm the galley sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party are the trends.
Costumes are expected to represent $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men from the Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't glamour.
Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kilograms of Hershey bars, nipples, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go on a candy hunt in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, let’s not tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; and yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to elucidate.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which is actually a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted homes in the U.S., which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes those awesome photos of you peeing on your friends on Facebook and you can’t take off and on which a guy you like leaves a headline of the “style.”
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and sculpting a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby lemonade trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pumpkins and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkins that gently crumble on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try carving their 922kg pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal defamation structure ("bad bank") with 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have it completely cleaned up within three years.
RBS also said it would register a provision for additional <0xC2><0xA3>4 to <0xC2><0xA3>4.5 billion in dubious debt depreciation on a quarterly basis, a write-off related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also clarified that this internal restructuring would release between <0xC2><0xA3>10 and <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion in capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would draw a line on the past, with the government being accused in particular of interfering in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for the customer base and for the UK,” new CEO Ross McEwan told the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior features baquet seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally fans who join Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rallying raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a serious road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry
Firefighters descended as a reminder along the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from a certain death
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called to retrieve him safely while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared into the career following a non-serious accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and came down as a reminder to rescue Ruby using an animal cage to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical Rescue Specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn’t move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical Rescue Specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to be out of it.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check-up; her overall condition was satisfactory, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified to see the rescue."
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were awesome.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely awesome.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: “We were afraid she would fall but she didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dragged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a chorus on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He dragged me when I was 18."
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said that he "categorically denies having made any advances on Katy Perry."
The representative added: “Maybe she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who made an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question a Turkmen Islamic movement
"Support behind the scenes to the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," the head of the Chinese security forces told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted online Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has named a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uyghurs of the same family from the Muslim-dominant region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with petrol cans against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother perished in the car fire.
The Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often referred to by the Chinese authorities as being responsible for the sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The breakup of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Trade Area in order to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic repercussions of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the big headlines (and it was to be predicted).
Neither has anyone said that EU Member States spend a large part of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I first heard the bobard that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely deadlocked.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties opposing the EU or campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and coming from nowhere, gathered nearly five million votes in the September federal elections and pulled the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the carcass weighing on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments registering excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has imposed on its members exchange rates favourable to German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a redundant disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt roars, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the French economy in ruins.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, returning the socialists to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot start from the principle that a split from the right will automatically favor the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her new popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single anti-currency and anti-European bloc within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are a good figure in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unite and will eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will come back to something that will resemble more the free “Europe of the Nations (sovereign)” privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will make the eyes of the United States soft.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of Little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending walkers to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accept a freer European agreement provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour chessboard, Alistair Darling, and the Conservatives/Coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Aging Early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts think the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The tendency towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s pubic breasts and hairs begin to grow at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedoendocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — in general, that doesn’t indicate a rapid shift to full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as bulging of the breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area, and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and a half, compared to 12 and a quarter in 1970.
“Once the breast has started to grow, it takes at least two or three years for the first menstrual periods to appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered “early” when the development of the breast is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster progression may justify tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first menstrual periods and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
The drug and hormonal treatment recommendations are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate and affective maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but recognizes that “controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have their own periods.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they’re going to handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first menstrual period at the age of 10.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, she was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from school frightened and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be cautious about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedoendocrinologist working at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls with early puberty should be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinemathèque, had won the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen cast their spells on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich surroundings of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing in to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" recounts in a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole earth.
It accepts to back up replacements to the raised foot in the studios.
Without housing, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
“His relationship with success is tortured, that’s what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who’s not there at the right time, who’s not a careerist but an integral person, with self-destructive behavior,” Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel from several Oscars and Cannes awards, told the press.
If Llewyn Davis didn’t exist, the two folk music filmmakers built their story on real figures of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich Village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as writes journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes on the look of a documentary, from the unselling 33T dusty music label inhabited by an unpaid old secretary, to the music choices of the studios of the time and the cafés where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by incorporating a funny character that constantly crosses the film: a gorgeous red cat with a crisp look, Llewyn Davis’s companion of fortune.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country."
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to “be considered good,” “coincidence can also launch someone’s career,” and “more and more today.”
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck in anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gerard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He never knew the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times described him as "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, theatre of the 198th and 199th works of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved during this trip with a stroller.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, ensured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
“Unquestionably between 120 and 150 million all countries are confused,” he said in March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Foch Avenue just a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS have been translated: Italian, German, Russian or Greek.
"Not counting pirate editions," he added, denoting a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivories reported from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, throws himself into the hands of all the villains of the land, communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a raft of violence and torture.
"I never pretended to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked “like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went on the spot and came back with real and long investigations.”
SAS’s father said “to do some sort of geopolitical leaflet.”
"I keep my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from services that I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SASs are often premonitory: thus, a month before the attack of a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Road to Damascus".
In “The Madmen of Benghazi,” he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan rebellion.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported on the 4X4 columns of jihadists that were based in the Malian capital.
I am not a guess, defended Gérard de Villiers, I just make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM marguerite typewriter "whose all parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page with the pen.
At the walls of his office are hanging assault rifles AK-47, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome in Africa, where I have many readers.
Gerard de Villiers once said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age."
He will not die and will not retire.
Not more than me.
Airplanes are arguing about the width of the seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute raging between major aviation manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The conflict focuses on the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy class passengers – which are not always the most courted by airlines, but to which space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economy classes, but its major U.S. rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as airliners sought to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, eventually hoping for a record orders at the event that will take place from November 17 to 21.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its refurbished “777X” will be able to accommodate 406 people in economy class seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange strikes on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is calling directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to outperform its competitors with more than 100 orders.
Recently we were able to see what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other in the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept that?”.
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ chief commercial officer.
As eating habits change, people grow larger, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American’s weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The size of the 21st century average American is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival clings to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named jet set was narrower.
Airbus added that it commissioned a study that indicated that an additional inch in the width of the seats would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures on seat width and argues that it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the experience in the cabin does not depend only on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to run their business,” said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their company better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies an estimated $700 billion aircraft order race at the market price in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first pointed out in July, seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Both Airbus and Boeing are claiming a 20% higher performance per seat in their latest models of long-haul twin engines than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to seat more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines have to choose.
The aircraft vendors who go around the world even take one meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While eager to offer comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of the cabins by offering wider side aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that his call to the aviation industry to set up a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make the 777X wave of sales forget.
Oracle shareholders annoyed by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle's shareholders voted Thursday against the proposal for compensation for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but comes to tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just hailed from the victory of his boat in the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had already received a negative vote on his salary.
Oracle’s boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group’s poor performance, which failed to meet its growth targets, but he received about $77 million in stock options.
His fixed salary is only one symbolic dollar.
Over the whole of 2013, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% while the bounce stock price jumped by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which rose 24% at the same time.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Suppress Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure one takes from smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice for life from nicotine addiction.
More tests are needed before starting human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of New York’s Weill Cornell Medical College said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having his dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated “were soothed,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous anti-tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently that the levels of antibodies remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use is completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t have any fun because of the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, security services said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But officials from intelligence, the army and the activist movement said he had lost his life in the strike, which was carried out in the northern Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shootout," a senior security official said.
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a trip to London, had informed the British government that talks had been initiated with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi is not influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied altering the lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out if Mr. Obeid had pressured several ministers of state to renew his leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a coffee shop, after their expiration in August 2005, without any calls.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former deputy secretary-general, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government has pressed for leases to be the subject of a tender.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay businesses, which earned the Obeids approximately $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, called for a change in government lease policy.
The transcript of telephone conversations submitted to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid's orders at the Ministry of Fisheries.
“Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has conducted airstrikes against missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity” test
The government is currently considering setting up an "authenticity test" for foreign workers holding a 457 visa while considering extending enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion intended to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unskilled positions or as a diverted means of bringing his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
“The unsuccessful statements about ‘foreigners returning to the end of the queue’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historic artifact.
The working paper outlines the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others under consideration.
If the “authenticity” criterion were adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to see “whether the job offer is genuine in the event that the applicant is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company.”
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, intending to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's 9-year-old son was traveling to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the UK government.
HS2 Ltd’s work suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “would bring the UK together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and improving the duration of journeys for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of a maximum of three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are huge.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to "unambiguously" support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland’s economic weight to the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to explore options for bringing the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps.”
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to soften electronic device regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to be able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision requiring U.S. carriers to perform significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to immediately change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
“The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on airplanes,” she said.
The issue is the subject of regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already told CASA about her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said it currently complies with the current rules.
“According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change that immediately,” she said.
The FAA’s decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand baggage program and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can authorize passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a gathering of about thirty people, according to the testimony collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was stirred on the side of Pia where a rift involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries were reported.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded are taken care of.
Singapore’s Loan Lenders Benefit from Middle Class Caused to Tighten the Belt
Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings at a lender at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore to pay his daughters’ tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband works as well, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, has become this week the third loan company to be introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Borrowing jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in Ms. Amirthalinga’s case – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, lenders on pledge have the advantage of not requesting a solvency check or salary proof, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to lenders on loan as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and overindebtedness from households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by overly lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to lenders on payday loans to fill the gap while their economies are slowing down.
This week, credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s cited growing household debt, stemming mainly from rising mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt/gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as much as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have prompted people to pledge their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items pledged at the city-state’s 200 loan-on-loan stores are gold.
People say, “The price of gold is high, let’s borrow the grandmother’s gold chain and we’ll come back for it next month.”
In Thailand, the largest lender, EasyMoney, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
ValueMax, the operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to grow not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside of Asia, said its CEO, Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore’s $66 million raised this week on its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticized for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah points out that pledges not only offer lower rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
“Customers mortgage assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
Insuring is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term.
People who go to lenders on pledge are also not only those who have financial problems.
Prosperous people in Singapore also go to ValueMax loan shops to pledge gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“It can be wealthy people who need to borrow short-term for business or investment, or small businesses who need cash to make a difficult move,” Ms. Yeah adds.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for youth in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was officiating, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released on condition.
In particular, it must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being chased out
A man in a Nazi uniform wearing a bracelet with a cross was asked to leave an English supermarket after customers complained to the management of the establishment that called the police, the store said on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," a spokeswoman for Asda said.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "by the time it arrived, he had already left without hesitation," she added.
I was standing in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
The people were mouth-watering.
“You don’t go out on the street like that unless you want to get attention,” Rosina Rusin, 60, told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to dress as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS bracelet twice a week for three years at Asda," Dutton said, explaining that he was suffering from "mental problems."
$325 Million Rescue Plan for Tasmania’s Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the floating health care system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent measures” to end a crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned over four years, was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 surgeries, particularly in the area of orthopedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up.
Funds are also provided for non-scheduled clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to care for Tasmania’s health system,” Plibersek said.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict regime of reporting and accountability.
The state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much “unless they are followed by genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request for help it submitted to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I hope the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “fortune solution.”
“The reason we are here is that the state Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that pulls out nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in $300 million, and pretend it's a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the bailout plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of the novel by Denis Diderot boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstruction of the era, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Superior Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours in lubricity or sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons Production Capacity, Surveillance Agency Says
Syria has destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day ahead of the deadline of the
November 1 set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or “defeat” all chemical weapons production units and machinery intended to mix toxic gases and fill ammunition.
Completing what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The militant group, which tracks the evolution of the human balance sheet through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, there were an estimated 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces were killed, of whom 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She has not updated this figure since.
About 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to Al-Qaeda groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal amid a lasting civil war, within tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was “now satisfied to have controlled – and destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling.”
She added that “no other inspection activity was planned at the moment.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... that elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the moral strength and courage that you have all shown as part of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was a strong explosion Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger Caused by Punishment Against One of Bali's Bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted with anger to the sentence imposed on the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by an execution platoon.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years fleeing as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in manufacturing explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also convicted of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have called for life imprisonment, but they could have asked for the man, who is described as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, to be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the brink of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be dragged in front of the execution squad,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times while under respiratory care.
Mr. Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali’s bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill al-Qaeda's former leader, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden for the purpose of re-establishing ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was making fun of the grief he might have caused to other people.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” said Ms. Corteen.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phones – under the highly anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers shouldn’t expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew training manuals and the rules on aircraft storage to be compliant.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane’s doors are closed.
They are not supposed to re-ignite them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft during the descent of the plane before landing and not re-ignite them until the plane has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during takeoffs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was happy with the changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers for that – it will be beneficial for everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room watchers” when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was noisily ejected from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered to be at risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could eventually create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, they could disrupt mobile phone antennas relays if they are used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government authorize a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there are no valid security reasons for these bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and are approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s executives loaded a line plane from Kindle e-book readers and stolen it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has given the members of the FAA Advisory Committee mixed feelings as to whether or not the use of the devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landings at instruments in low visibility conditions.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for travelers equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A heliported bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, helmeted after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The waterslide was hoisted aboard a helicopter towards Aberdeen last month before it was reset by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa rescue center.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This waterslide was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted to bring our help.”
The water slide was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the broadest and most comprehensive survey from UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting caught up in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcanes.
When asked for their opinion on specific political issues – from monopolies regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders think that control of these key competencies should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and even more so, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives in favour of a treaty change and the development of a trade-based relationship with the EU rather than a policy-based one.
This finding, which can be found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the corporate world is insisting on a “significant change” that returns power to the UK.
The stakes are high – succeeding in changing the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would see a 16% turnaround of votes in favour of maintaining the country in the EU during a referendum.
The prime minister should not doubt for a moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan aimed at renegotiating the terms of Britain’s accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will represent a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain, and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means re-emphasising trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of invited children in the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the festivities have recovered.
In New York, thousands of costumed people took part in the parade organized in the "Greenwich Village" neighborhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to wear the suit I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan feast celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller says Bulgaria’s gas pipeline is ushering in a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the director of Gazprom said.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe’s largest large-scale project,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, the country through which most of Russia's gas destined for Europe transits, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director adds.
Miller added that the direct junction with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream’s gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti reported on Thursday, taking information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if you count three other small nearby islands.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutineers, an episode in the history of the English Navy that resulted in three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen residents, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutiny, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the island unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes the creation of such a protected zone would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to ensure its surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place surveillance military vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEZ, neighboring Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin province in northeast China was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday for corruption.
Expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million yuan of bribes, according to official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the president of Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and those in charge of obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, the Beijing First Intermediate Court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as untreatable with the powerful "tigres" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of senior officials were convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most dramatic recent case was that of the former Chongqing CCP chief, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions within the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating a party-independent body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were charged with sexual assault on children following allegations made against Caringbah's educator, Jonathan Lord, in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it had “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned on two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education monitor was convicted of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel for the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA was inaccurate, emphasizing, "external controls of the YMCA have been carried out and indicated that the safety of children is a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst assessments of four institutions during a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees were aware that they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's breaches of children's safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, keeping them private, making them sit on his knees, telling them that he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under Lord's guidance and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found the YMCA Caringbah's child services manager, Jacqui Barnat, to be "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director-General said he rejected staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their superiors.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord had blurred their judgment, which meant that they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his views before the New South Wales YMCA Council saying that, for the organization, the lesson from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not be about "reporting" by staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were cited, was made by YMCA’s Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that the decision was intended to prevent any contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excessive zeal" and that it had been improperly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruiting, controlling, initiating, training and overseeing staff.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Special Envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East Peace Process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair reportedly replied, according to London's Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it can probably happen, so..."
When many equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year Trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland win, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and just a few months after making his first guns, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables – who are of the same size – were hailed for their presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat hat a little on the side in a casual way to show off his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton has been hailed by judges for its uncommon natural training qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has been training since with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great duo.”
They showed up against and against everyone, but both picked up the gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy happy that he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it.”
He walked the entire length of the track running and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he’ll probably be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he’ll do a great job.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They make a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they paraded on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I’m sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he looked really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be redesigned"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be redesigned, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public company.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order of "recasting" comes from the Guangdon Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“New Express’s writing was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the persons responsible at New Express and immediately remake the newspaper’s management team.”
Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a front page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories for money.
“In this case, I hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express posted his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made television confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in rade.
The leak of radioactive steam detected at one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the ship was at sea was "safe for sailors", but not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal has just confirmed to us "the unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist of the defense ship, assures that its teams and those of Areva, sent to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the faulty boiler.
"Everything is being implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment by the end of 2013," DCNS said.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not question the program of activity of the ship" nuclear-powered.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier is out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had flew from Toulon in mid-October for a training.
In particular, in order to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small breakdown", confined to the confinement space of the reactor, had then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew was not exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great deal of dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, a flood of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs not to be ended.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved to allow a highly respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly stolen from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, we do not bother with sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of lazy ducks: deficit cultural center, large subsidies to the Energy City, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they should be sold to the private company or demolished.
It is also regrettable to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that never came.
I do, however, make an honorable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such companies, but rather at the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were delighted to learn that the Fishing and Pile Lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large decline in population, water use has declined considerably throughout the territory.
Without mentioning wasting it, the city will never lack water and the strict regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by ties with beautiful degrees for the most part and I don’t think a sheep farmer will do worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, has been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4 foot by 3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging over a length equivalent to nearly six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of undefined warehouses, which makes it easy to conceal trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were taken out unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who reportedly worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following marijuana harvesting in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge to drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard crossing equipped with railroads that departed from the kitchen of a Tijuana home and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a “remission notice” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sex crimes, after exhausting all possible avenues under UK law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he made against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “has issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to appear at a police station on the date and time of his choice,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions for his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after unveiling more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting classified information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Are you finished typing passwords to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to verify the identity of a person performing transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but worry about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés has authorised 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, of the shape of the hand or of the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere, anytime,” said Justin Brookman, consumer privacy officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of Identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a drawback: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for about twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Due to the increased accuracy of the sensors and the computational capacity of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and unfalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers forensic police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognising a person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who he claims to be).
The identification so far concerned the issuance of identity documents: it is necessary to compare the biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) with the information that the State has on all citizens already filed.
This ensures that one person does not attempt to usurp someone else’s identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
“We retrieve images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet,” explains Dany Nassif, NEC France’s commercial development manager for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a photo of a quidam who is queuing in a store, track its progression thanks to facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical (opening of a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the buddy pointing for another," justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also affect transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing their card and placing their hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the keystroke of the secret code.
A similar technique is being tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in store with your bank card, the customer does not type his code, but enters his finger in a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in cash thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailor-made options.
And finally, rest assured by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is locked if you try to move it,” says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Specialists in the protection of privacy, they, continue to worry.
“The advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick, of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was inflicted an amend of <0xC2><0xA3>1,000
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to carry between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the required caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his licence led to a six-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100 per victim.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the measure of capital gains tax but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, enrolled a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold titles rather than individually to a company.
The stamp right already applies to residential properties in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West and the Yorkshire and Humber Region.
Mr. Cook said: "As a result of the increased stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance law in this regard, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestige real estate – the 5 to 10 percent of the highest real estate market prices – in the thriving southwest London sector stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon rose by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
Prices in central London are growing steadily year-on-year by 5.6 percent, but have been eclipsed by a fast-growing “domestic market,” with the city’s southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) recovering, according to Savills’ studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how a dog’s tail movements are related to his mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs stirred their tails more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs stirred their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what was wrong with other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs’ disordered tail movements, the researchers followed animals watching movies where other dogs appeared.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusing factor – and we were able to traffic the tail movement and present it as going more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog without expression stirring the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog stirring the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed a tail diverting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog shaking the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you encounter other dogs repeatedly and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side results in a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
Researchers say the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better grasp their animals’ emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol’s School of Veterinary Sciences, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs would go more easily to a robot dog when his tail was stirring to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs participating in the different studies did not fully consider film animals or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“While many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to perform Friday at The Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogramm the show.
The announcement came after the group was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these concerts.
We apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis to appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest church men in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – this is a group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope generally appoints as many cardinals as necessary for the number of cardinal electors to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year’s consistory will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis’ election in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is some sort of tendency to favour Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope had to decide for himself.
“From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was "absolutely possible" that Francis asks for advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero said the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to repair the back of the seats
General Motors recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to fix a problem with manually tilting files, according to a statement from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the files do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards regarding head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the headrest may not protect passengers properly, thus increasing the risk of injury,” according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The rollout of GM’s pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM notified pickup owners of the defect during the first fifteen of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the owners' newsletter due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11 a.m. on Rue Marquette, near the intersection of Rue Beaubien, in the arrondissement of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
It is likely that work on the foundations has been going on here for some time.
A city foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site in order to retrieve his tools.
I was passing by by car and I saw the wall collapse with a large cloud of smoke,” said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We could only see part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an old man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Reanimation maneuvers were attempted by the emergency services, but were unsuccessful.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Commission on Occupational Health and Safety was sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
The cry of despair of an Obama electorate
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change.
He says that Obama has made praiseworthy efforts distracted by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
It is a book that I thought would encourage me during the morosity of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope again.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s the memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical records at night and I went to bed, this book reminds me of a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in an overwhelming victory, and news reporters took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades wept with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before he took office in 2008, he had 82% of favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I am crediting Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, to the end of the “no seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the areas of immigration reform, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after defending the Obama administration many times before my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the brink of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the wrongdoings of the government.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and exceeding the authorized spending during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and random events, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all of the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, who was elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had heard for so long.
Yet, while the favorable opinion index dropped below 45% this week, it is even harder to go back to 2008 through this book.
He made me want the many promises that flew away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses in favor of Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on the street from Retinne to Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fleron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the emergency services, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who disputes the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, made this argument in an attempt to dismiss issues related to a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Palmer won the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of reshaping the voting system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why couldn't we have a system where you could enter, enter your contact details in a computer, vote immediately, and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered possible options with regard to electronic voting and has recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions “very seriously”.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new bump dolphin species off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for the scientific mission at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
Although species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis in the past, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of species classification.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are questioned due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two species that are very close morphologically have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered endangered or endangered depending on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility of recovery from nearby stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the newly discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This brewing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
The marine environment is the least well-known environment.
It is preferable to send robots to Mars, rather than to know what lives in the Mariannes pit, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than we do on marine research, and it’s high time that that changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources close to the case, showing once again that the global regulators’ investigation into suspected currency market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators as part of investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the enlarged investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file said that RBS had sent files of emails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of cash trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of cash exchange trading at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior forex trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been the subject of any charges.
Mr. Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS said this week it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspected currency market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations of bankers who have agreed to manipulate foreign exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the case said.
Banks are peeling instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News of these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers of investment banks’ trading units in recent years, but that has been challenged this year due to the low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at little cost.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had sent back a trader working in its London Stock Exchange fund office this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford has been scrambled, says a lawyer
After police confirmed they had handed over a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby claimed he had never seen an investigation “so sneaky.”
Mr Ruby told The Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, 35, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering parcels to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Mr. Ruby called "inexplicable" the fact that police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put his phone on the wire, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair chose in good conscience not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Mr Ruby's remarks a "obvious and desperate attempt" to assert himself to the media in a case that does not concern him in any way.
In a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock exchanges decline in mid-session, except for London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are down on Friday at mid-session, led by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe the U.S. Federal Reserve could unravel its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could soften its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures predict an opening of upward U.S. stocks, after two consecutive sessions of retreat.
In terms of values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest rebound of the CAC 40, led by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) scored the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also publishing declining results this morning and announcing the creation of an internal "bad bank" structure bringing together 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
In turn, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the forefront of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to a press release requesting AT&T to consider a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation about the ECB’s monetary policy is going well, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank, testifies.
The ECB’s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a decline in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its recession against the US currency and hit a two-week low at $1.3517.
These same conjectures, on the other hand, support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared that the health system reform law ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, under penalty of fine – and declared it constitutional under the government’s taxation power.
The president of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other 2,700-page sections of the Act and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered to the detriment of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The blocking procedure was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including nominee Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to former fighters in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet Cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and dead of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by the mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian tie-up at Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were wounded Thursday evening, October 31, 2013 during a violent halt on the Gaza-Israeli border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip's only power plant ceased to operate on Friday, November 1, after its fuel stockpiles were exhausted, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority said.
A local Brigade Commander Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another cadre of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shelling during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younès, in the south of the local medical sources of the Gaza Strip.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigade officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made a 100-metre incursion into the territory before retreating.
The confrontation lasted for half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zouhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers were killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during a Zionist incursion into Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
For its part, the Israeli army said the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug in Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, specifying that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas fired an explosive device targeting IDF forces and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," Army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
Israel struck an airbase in northwest Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, the satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details on the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he said.
Officials of the Israeli government have refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing “exclusive sources” that she has not named, the Saudi capital chain said that “the bombing targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon,” referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, had reported several explosions heard at dawn Wednesday at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, relying on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by Henri Michaux' inks and poems, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advances, of profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a series of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, wholly dressed in black, with only their hands and face uncovered, wait on either side of the playground, rush when the next graph appears, embody it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in solo relays, in a group at the same time (a mass that does solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
One thinks of "Gloire du matin", where, alone, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online in the foreground.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux' poem, monocorde and monotonous in the crye, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and deafening.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - such as those hairs that fade or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has imposed herself, with her tics.
The result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
The inks of Michaux, like forms of Gestalt, open up a wider and more boring imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers hacked by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The audience loved it, the welcome was warm.
Gymnopedias, after intercourse, is richer.
The scene is partly draped with gray, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers reworked to play the scores.
Their touching misadventures in music give a real fragility.
On stage, couples, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Bouffons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnivores, fugitives or players.
The gesture, the laughter and the little cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the bodies in coitus, of beings that fuse.
But the piece takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it is the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei face legal action over Nortel patents
The group, which holds thousands of former Nortel patents, began a series of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it co-founded during the auction of patents that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Court of Appeals in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow you to display advertising related to search terms on the Internet, said the findings of the lawsuit, which is the core of Google's business.
It was not possible to contact representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are manufacturing phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market that is partly based on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, it has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the court said in a statement.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater that caused the explosion
Grandma reportedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a home in Gesves, which injured two seriously injured Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, the King's alternate prosecutor said Friday evening.
The expert sent to the site by the prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and an accumulation of gas.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she by helicopter, him by ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who descended on the site.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
All except, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remaining intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the police of the Arches intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of office to the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took oath in front of the 18 black court judges whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal and hard-hitting organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to applaud the new president and, standing out from the presidential fast of the Mubarak years, the traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic “rescue wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the Mo-bar president.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges in the woodworking room where he was sworn in.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by a military fanfare that played the national anthem while he was guarding himself.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song “The people and the army, hand in hand...” sung by thousands of people gathered in the university’s grand amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, starting the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year, and vowed to regain presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed.
But by accepting to officially take oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is customary, he bows down to the will of the army, showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the US has slowed the rise of the car market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal governments weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, according to figures released Friday by manufacturers, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
The three major Detroit manufacturers are showing double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market stood at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he believes that this slight slowdown is primarily explained by “the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first fifteen months of the month.”
GM, however, reported a nearly 16% increase in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, up from 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group’s four brands saw their business performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pickups, saw its sales grow by 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
For its part, Fiat-controlled Chrysler announced an 11% increase in its sales to 140,083 vehicles, up from 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted lower-than-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2%, respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, the GM stock was gaining 1.4% at 16:35 GMT, while Ford was selling 1.1%.
Renault plunged into the stock market after Nissan's warning
Renault on Friday blamed the sharpest fall in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced a nearly 20% decrease in its annual net profit forecast, traders reported.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a redesign of its management.
Several traders reported that Renault’s share was affected by the “warning” this morning.
“It’s clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” says a trading official from a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan’s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from Nissan’s website.
Greece: Two dead in a shooting near a local of the neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another seriously injured on Friday night by gunfire from two people who were on a motorcycle passing in front of a Golden Dawn Neo-Nazi party venue in the western suburb of Athens, police said.
The police have not yet been able to provide information on the identities of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn claimed that the victims were guards at their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorism police rushed to the central avenue in the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six members of Golden Dawn, including the party's leader and founder, for participation in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's Appeal Rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, saw his call rejected and will be suspended for the next two Champions League matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for hitting Neymar, the Scottish midfielder saw his suspension extended to three matches by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed" and felt that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are without electricity across the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to strong winds affecting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, Montérégie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The Greater Montreal region is also experiencing a lot of breakdowns with nearly 7,000 homes without electricity in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and expects record results thanks to vacationers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit on the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said Flight Centre had achieved 8% profits in the first half and that the second half had started in force, especially with respect to non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results over the entire fiscal year before deducting interest and taxes,” he said.
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector bounced back in the second half, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure travel sector recorded good results while business customers spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to profit from the entire fiscal year for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns shoot at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown people opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without making any casualties, as a result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, Interior Ministry spokesman Gen. Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt receives virtually no more tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloody suppresses the protests of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling, and grammar
As part of the English literature courses, students will be required to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a nineteenth-century novel, a romantic poem, and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will need to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical review.
It will make changes in other key subjects next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Regulatory Bureau of Examinations, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our exam system to restore public confidence," insisting that CSEGs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the in-depth math GCSE - as well as the greater importance given to the subjects listed in international rankings - would likely encourage higher-insurance schools.
The programme will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
Eighteen-year-old welcomes children with a rifle to the Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 went door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man told the gendarmes he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without any trace, was actually buried in a common grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he told the daily newspaper on the basis of archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would answer one of the great enigmas of the postwar era.
The German secret services, the BND, also assured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were completely wrong.
"Since August 1945, Müller's body has been found in a temporary tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing a general's uniform.
"Inside the left pocket were his state of service with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district mayor of the Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The president of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is being grossly shaken," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who were never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and under his command Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, was sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

He walks through the mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle delivers free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to choose him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would carry the sequelae for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle adds.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., go to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation hasn't changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr. Bwelle said.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers practiced more than 700 surgical acts for free over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they pile up in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrains to get to the villages that need the most help.
Luck does not always follow them.
Many times they had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best housing available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
“We get 500 people on each visit,” Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinerant hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive brackets, a collected pair of glasses or a free birth certificate – a document required to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his or her place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s an overwhelming pace, but the village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They’re hitting drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, practiced 700 surgical acts for free over the past year, and they know that their presence can make all the difference for those they come to help.
One man explained that the free surgery he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“This will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to living this itinerant hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances his association at 60%; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity for field learning that they don't have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help sprinkle the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to extinguishing.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and alleviating pain are the reasons that drive me to do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but by highlighting its weakness for crossing paths, Sciences-Po, Hautes Etudes.
Arbiter of the works of others in his office in the rue Gaston-Gallimard?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Certainly still, but knowing that such a sacred can not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it has passed.
They gladly recognized in him a great awakener, animator and federator of their work, but by observing that he showed little inclination to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The vicious tongues were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen eye and a laziness of scholarship, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora soon two years ago have already established that the one who went on to not write had a lot and well written.
The book here should definitely make him justice.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual wandering, the jubilation set to jump as if at joint feet from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the broker back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: It is a concern of the time.
Here is a few, we have been collectively invited to give a definition of it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that chases Pierre Nora is completely different.
He does not become an heir to an eternal frankness, he refuses to define it.
Anxious analyst of a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at each step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented by annoying questions.
This one, which is born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so permanently settled within its borders, so formerly carved and solidly masonry, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are only so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to conjure up the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Francos and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very ancient.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits the national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without being able to deny it; concerned on the contrary to find its sacrality and all the more greedy of unity and indivisibility as she had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, hence, an invinciblely binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueness of the French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so that the American escape of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinship only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men cluttered with an Ancient Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and the confit.
There always honored founding fathers, and here revolutionary ancestors who struggle to make models, and who, after all, killed each other.
There is an institutional consistency, and here is a cascade of constitutions, as well as so many mistakes to catch and attempts to resume.
France is leaving, France is coming.
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could sew the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of number two.
In this Third Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France was obscurely preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity has only had a time.
Here it is again in debate, stirred by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the circumspect sketch of France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
It was discovered that the chimney was a housewife.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The border crosser stood in the center of the center.
And he who had deposited, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had withdrawn from the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will have ended up doing it.
Certainly in a less rigid, more bursting and more subtle form.
But let us not be mistaken, just as compelling.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is complex enough to manage"
Abducted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "World hostages", which he has presided over for several years.
Its main objective is to provide the possibility for hostages to lodge a complaint and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret were released Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to return to their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the "World hostages" association.
On the night of your release, you were on the 8:00 p.m. stage of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your liberation today?
Especially in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Roger Auque.
He tells me we're free, but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
This is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland hotel site where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the embassy of France.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no way to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How did your arrival on French soil go?
We landed in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible hustle and bustle.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I come back and there's plenty.
The descent of the plane staircase, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and me, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull themselves together to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a bit of the police to prevent some from getting up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and suddenly we're under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we did the hardest thing.
The same evening, I'm at 8 o'clock, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then starts a kind of rehabilitation to life, very gently, for one or two months that are a bit like holidays.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I was entitled to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grâce the days after my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on him, remember him if necessary, that we are not committed to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostage-takers.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four Niger hostages?
I listen to what's being said.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I try to share things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat of president of the "World Hostages" association that allows me to distance myself, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a problem with semantics.
The taking of hostages must be described as "political" - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages to have access to justice, to file a complaint and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why not say to the hostage-takers, "you have violated the rules of war, like all the Geneva Conventions, you will be brought to justice"?
It seems to me, however, grounded, legitimate, struck by common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists take to the streets to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is raging in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, this Muslim Brotherhood activist points out.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial if a pro-Morsi arises, it is he who is supposed to bring Sisi to trial, not the other way around.
Morsi must sue Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, “all military spouses are entitled to a Department of Defense ID card and the benefits that come with it,” the minister recalled in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located in their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The secretary of defense said he ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-state roundup began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between Texas law and federal law on same-sex marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage to be about 5,600 active, including the National Guard, the Reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations will take place on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin in the wake, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the awards ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, are already attending competitions at the highest level, like the prodigious young hero Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already won his place at the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he likes nothing but to show off to competitors who surpass him by three heads.
The mayor of Toronto chases journalists who came to question him on a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugging himself, according to several media outlets.
A video of the case appears to support these suspicions.
The person, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging to have a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he kicked out of his property several journalists who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes the images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced on Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of rabies has been confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive," the ministry said in a statement.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
Departments are now calling for people who were bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this kitten, or whose pet was in contact with this kitten between October 8 and 28, to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from November 1.
"As France has been free of rage since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not safe," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded case of "indigenous" rabies dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizooties (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," the ministry recalled, and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama backs down on his health care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday on his unambiguous and often-repeated promise that “if you’re satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their service providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “a buzz in the news” about terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to get complete and better suited health diets for the same price, or even less than expected.
“You’re going to win,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who insure themselves were forced to change their plan because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Allow me to address these Americans directly: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius said during her testimony before the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace in October had failed "unfortunately".
“I’m as frustrated and irritated as anyone,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, while she believed her micro cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, Missouri Republican representative, to find out if she should go to Missouri.
For more than three hours, Billy Long continued to ask Ms. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel releases special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky chosen, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 world champion, unveiled a special helmet for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday, the drawing of which was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automotive brand, of its stable.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, so he can see the German champion up close, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, for testing.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Above all, let us not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only aimed at the suburbans.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native town of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal number one is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the people on the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them, too.
There are only extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -consultable on the Internet- from many themes intended to talk to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years old, the rehabilitation of the function of guardian of buildings...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this is likely to be fair, he admits."
It's a matter of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven top spots in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I've been receiving since yesterday don't all emanate from the suburbs," he said.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that US espionage “has gone too far inappropriately”
John Kerry pointed out a softening of the United States’ defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions espionage “has gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, ruled on “autopilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities emerged.
The leaks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government learned of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from World War II to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course September 11th."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed boundaries, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry stressed, however, that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns over the alleged U.S. spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the United States, the president of the Senate's subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration raised by the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in our mutual commitment to combating terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate European Affairs subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I’m going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has disrupted relations with some US allies, however the agency’s director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it involved metadata that the US allies and NATO allies had by.
Other revelations included documents released by Snowden that the NSA intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the allies' espionage by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and of both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be revealed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “affectionate firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world doing espionage,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry plans to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the resentment generated by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down Thursday, slammed by Shell's poor performance and the day after a Fed announcement of its continued support for the economy, as expected.
Australian Woman Appeals for Imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of false statements after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before admitting to having invented the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local police station cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women’s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Canberra Ministry of Foreign Affairs to help her daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“Obviously, we’ve had an awkward time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after paying a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region in southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in sentences of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent killing in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to rediscover its deteriorating image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht fans coming otherwise than with RSCA cars
The French police have decided to impose strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain scheduled Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, spokeswoman for the Brussels-midday police zone.
Belgian RSCA supporters who wish to attend this Champions League match will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Recem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had the intention of going to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has announced that measures have been taken to allow arrests or even guards to be held," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a native language other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and staff of education, to think about ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The organization Vision Diversité has been walking around schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are from the tribe or they came from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So, we create projects so that they identify with all of that,” says Vision Diversity President Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support to staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who, sometimes, also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different educational strategies, that's the real need," she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
