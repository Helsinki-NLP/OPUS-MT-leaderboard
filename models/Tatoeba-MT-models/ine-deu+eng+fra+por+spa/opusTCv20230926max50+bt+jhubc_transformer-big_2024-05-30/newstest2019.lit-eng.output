MG Baltic case: Gustaini's new lawyer says he has not yet had access to the case material
At the eleventh hearing of the MG Baltic trial on Monday, all the defendants gathered: <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Vytautas Gab<0xC5><0xA1>ys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The hearing began with the statements of the accused.
At the previous court hearing, the state-appointed new lawyer for Gustain, Alexander Doroshev, told the jury that he had not yet been able to get acquainted with the material of the case.
Then MG Baltic lawyer Linas Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius stated that in order to ensure full personal defense, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer to access the material of the case and asked to postpone the hearing.
"In order to ensure a person's defence, he must have access to the criminal case material.
This is not just a formal sit-in,” Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The new lawyer, A. Doroshev, noted that he was unable to get acquainted with either the charge or the entire material of the case.
At the previous hearing, the suspect, Mr. Gustainis, announced that he had refused his lawyer because he would no longer be able to pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the meeting.
The lawyers of the defendants were angry that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, when taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions favorable to the group in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as influenced the selection of public procurement winners, ELTA recalls.
The pre-trial investigation interviewed more than 150 persons, including more than 50 members of the Seimas in the past and this term, several former ministers, members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 screenings were conducted.
Gustainis is suspected of having received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 in bribes, Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius - <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000, V. Gap<0xC5><0xA1>ys - more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>27,000, Masiulis is suspected of having taken more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106,000 in bribes.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade in influence, the Liberal agitation is suspected of bribery, trade in influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade in influence from these parties.
It is suspected that politicians consulted with the vice-president of the MG Baltic group, R. Kurlianski, on bribes, and subsequently proposed or supported initiatives in favour of the group in the Seimas or other institutions.
Guardians of Ethics: The Liberals’ Controversy Board on the Law of Conduct of the Vilnius Department
"The decisions taken by the government are in accordance with the statutes," said its head Vytautas Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas after the committee meeting.
“This decision was not a new one.
We had already made an clarification as a commission in July, when there was a question about Paghegije and Utena.
We then said that, according to the statutes, this is a matter for the board of directors.
And if the board decides that a section can do what it wants - go with the committee and the board approves it, then the section can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is a decision for all the sections to form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas, the party’s board will now decide on further action.
On October 17, the Board of the Party Liberals’ Movement revoked the decision of the Vilnius City Department to participate in the municipal elections not with the party’s list, but with the newly vacant electoral committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the liberals in the capital to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes, the decisions of the board.
By October 31, the Vilnius section had to cancel the aspirations to participate in the municipal elections with the list of the committee.
But the department did not.
The former head of the department, parliamentarian Au<0xC5><0xA1>rin<0xC4><0x97> Armonait<0xC4><0x97>, has already left the Liberal movement.
Vilnius Mayor Remigijus <0xC5><0xA0>ima<0xC5><0xA1>ius, the former chairman of the Liberal Movement, promising to pursue another term as head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "To Vilnius, of which we are proud!".
He also left the party.
Elections to municipal councils and mayors will be held next year.
Residents of a village in northern India caught a tiger in a tractor that had previously smashed a man, officials said on Monday.
Forest watchdog Mahavira Kaujlagi (Mahavira Kaujlagi) said the tiger, who worked in the fields late on Sunday, surrounded the beast by villagers and, while trying to escape, drove her to a tractor.
Residents say that this tiger also attacked and protected a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Shelter in the Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km southeast of the state capital of Utar Pradesh, Laknau.
Fishing tigers are prohibited in protected areas.
District Director Ramesh Pandey said that according to the Wildlife Protection Act, the case will be reported to the police.
In April, villagers struck another tiger in the Nighasan district of Utar Pradesh state, which suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is the national animal of India; according to the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year’s government data showed that at least one person per day was killed during the previous three years in collisions with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have been steadily increasing since India launched a tiger protection program in the 1980s, which established shelters in national parks, and began to criminalize the hunting of large cats.
Although the methods of counting tigers have changed, censuses suggest that the population of about 1,800 tigers then increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Cats and dogs are required to be labelled with microchips
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, along with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which propose that cats and dogs must be labelled with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous microchips and their registration and labelling should be organized by the local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge with state funds, and in 2020, cats will be labelled free of charge, so residents will not have to worry and the costs will be covered by specially planned state funding,” said K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee.
The amendments to the Act aim to address the systemic need for labelling of pet animals.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that the expected average cost of the microchip and the service, which will amount to around EUR 5, will be compensated for all pet owners during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling for all pets can reach up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach 2 million euros per year.
The labelling programmes are expected to be funded through the Municipal Environmental Support Specific Programme, which will significantly increase revenues this year due to increased natural resource taxes and redistribution of funds.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for cat and dog labelling, but also for castration and other programs.
According to Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikos, the practice of mandatory labelling is widespread in almost all countries of the European Union, this makes it possible to protect the animals themselves (because the lost can be easily returned to the owners), and saves the time of the animal farmers themselves, when the search for the fugitive and the lost pet will take a lot of time.
In addition, EU legislation stipulates that it is only possible to travel with pets labelled.
At the same time, labelling requires responsible care for the animal throughout its life.
Earlier proposals for mandatory labelling were resisted because the relevant programmes were proposed to be financed by the population.
"The model now provided should avoid this criticism, as animal protection is proposed to be financed by the increased revenues of the environmental support program and the right to labelling by granting not only veterinarians, but also the public, i.e. individuals of animal care institutions, who have listened to the special courses in the project of the Veterinary Academy.
The bill was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different Seimas factions - K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
In eastern Afghanistan, 13 members of government forces were killed in an attack by the Taliban
Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four more soldiers were wounded during the attack on a joint army and police checkpoint in the Chogyang district.
According to Noori, six fighters were killed and ten Taliban were wounded in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces.
A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, released a statement in which the movement claimed responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Noori said the post was set up two days ago in a strategically important area to intercept the Taliban's supply route.
During the attack, the post was completely destroyed.
"Morning" extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will take place in the Vilnius Morning Arena, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The match will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius Morning, which maintains warm relations with Ukrainian basketball, will host the teams of Cherkassy Mavpy and Pristina Pristina Pristina on November 7 under its roof in the morning arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to host this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to welcome us," Maxim Michelson, head coach of the Ukrainian team, said in a statement.
“We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the countries with the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope to get some support from the Vietnamese.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team occupies third place after the first round with one win in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has won more.
This will be very important for Group E, as only two teams will enter the next stage.
In the past, the Ukrainian and Kosovo national team match for the 2017 European Basketball Championship was also held in Vilnius.
Then the Ukrainian team won 100:61.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the match for free on Wednesday, and the start of the match is 19:00.
"Women Lie Better" star B. Arsobaita persecuted by liars
Probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-haired actress Brigita Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> has already been given roles related to liars for several times.
First the series "Women lie better", then the show "Lies" and finally the comedy "Lies".
In this film, Brigita plays the flattering wife of Dani Kaslauskos hero.
“I really liked filming in Lies because I’m more of a theatre actress and I rarely appear in movies.
A wonderful team of colleagues gathered from the beginning promised a great result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would certainly be big and serious.
I've never been fascinated by those small, decorative four-legged figs.
But during the filming Sunny was so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and I eventually even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but unsuccessfully.
A new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai", produced by the Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Between Us, Boys..." by producer Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys and Vladimir Baltakis, has been added to the comic and intriguing peripetitions of family members from the first minutes.
Your lover just announced - she's waiting.
That would be great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Unable to announce the "good news" to everyone, parents suddenly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens just before the most beautiful holiday of the year - Christmas!
But the ending will be even more surprising, because no one expected such atomic bombs.
Not all heroes are what they seem at first glance.
In addition to B. Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> in the comedy "Melagiai" good mood for spectators gifts four times movie stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Uzait<0xC4><0x97>, Giedr<0xC4><0x97> Giedraityt<0xC4><0x97>, Liubomiras Laucevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Larisa Kalpokait<0xC4><0x97> and Gediminas.
Comedy "Liars" - in China from November 9
Deciding whether to write off <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million unpaid taxes on migrants
The Seimas on Tuesday agreed to consider an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of the Place of Residence prepared by the "peasants" leader Ramunas Karbauskis.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will continue its consideration of amendments on or after 6 December, upon receipt of the Government's conclusions.
According to Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, in three years one person does not pay about 1,000 euros, and now there are about 100,000 such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sys regretted that in this way the Seimas would "invite some of the people to break their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no fees would be charged.
Antanas Matulas, a member of the Conservative Committee on Health Affairs, noted that Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment by paying a small health insurance tax - they are provided with the same services as the residents who pay this tax.
The amendments provide that persons who leave Lithuania will be considered to have paid social security contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and Sodra will exempt them from the payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, the head of Sodra, has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the lives of emigrants and the activities of Sodra.
Video of a Sliding Bear on the Internet Reveals a Serious Problem
Sloping down like a mother bear climbs a straight snowy slope, and the baby keeps climbing, sliding down and again obstinately copying.
The video received a lot of views and comments.
People admired the little bear's tenacity - he slipped down repeatedly, he climbed again to his mother.
He does not succeed at first, but the little one does not even try to give up and finally reaches his goal.
The video was indeed the focus, but it also reveals the threat posed by humans to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
“It’s clear to me that the bear drone was very frightening.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drone hadn’t been flying around, they would probably have chosen a safer route or taken it slower or more cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," environmentalist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and colleagues investigated how drones work on bears.
The animals were fitted with heart work gauges.
When the drone approached, some bears would run away, others would not run anywhere, but all their hearts would start beating more often.
Scientists advise using drones to film animals responsibly, avoid flying too close, avoiding noise, and avoiding flying where it is prohibited.
The exiled president was quoted in the newspaper.
A Kiev court on Tuesday invited the ousted Russian president Viktor Yanukovych to attend a hearing on his alleged state treason in an unusual way, the summons was published in the state's official journal.
Let's call the court, published in the government's news newspaper "Uriadovo Kurjer", the former leader is invited to come to the hearing of the criminal process on November 19, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that V. Yanukovych has the right to participate in the meeting by video communication.
On October 30, the Kiev court announced the end of the debate in the Yanukovych case.
Yanukovych’s lawyer, who works in Russia, Alexander Goro<0xC5><0xA1>inski, was given the opportunity to register with the register of foreign lawyers until November 19, so that he could attend a meeting where Yanukovych is expected to have his last word on video.
The Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president’s refusal to sign an association treaty with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been deported to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, and shortly thereafter a war broke out in the east of the country between separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, the fighting has claimed the lives of about 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a long-term ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas will hold the list of Conservatives in the Vilnius City Council
The Conservative candidate for the year has already been approved by the former Minister of Economy, the parliamentary Dainius Kreivys.
Over the weekend, during the primary elections of the Conservatives, party members rated the list of candidates for the Municipal Council of Vilnius.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas became the leader of the Conservatives list of the TS-LKD Vilnius Conference.
Paul<0xC4><0x97> Kuzmickien<0xC4><0x97>, Adam Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas, Gediminas <0xC5><0xA0>vilpa, Audrius Koistys, Rasa Baskien<0xC4><0x97>, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Ar<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC5><0xB3> Ar<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC4><0x97>s, and Mantas Benku, president of the League of Young Conservatives.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on March 3 next year.
Restrictions on Cogeneration Power Plants Appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (Constitutional Court) the decision of the governing bodies to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition Sejm Group of the Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of Sejm members had appealed to the CT to investigate the conformity of the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by the governors.
"Parliamentarians stress that the provisions of the law aim to question the projects of waste incineration plants already underway, instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential area) until the entry into force of the law in Vilnius and Kaunas for the construction of waste incineration plants," the statement said.
"Parliamentarians note that in view of the fact that the prohibition on the construction of objects of state importance (i.e. the distance is determined and the concept of 'residential territory' is defined) is not formulated in the law of the country, the conclusion is that the prohibition is disproportionately limited, or even denies the effect of the law on the construction of objects of state importance.
The appeal claims that the law passed is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CT has repeatedly indicated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the newly adopted legislation entered into force.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law backwards in accordance with an unspecified criterion.
The establishment of such a legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the appeal states.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants.
If the current projects are suspended, the state would suffer not only hundreds of millions of financial losses, huge losses suffered by the people of Lithuania - increased heating costs, increased environmental pollution due to the increasing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, senior deputy of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democrats and the ruling Social Democrats working group, signed the appeal to the CT.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to gather 71 votes to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Law passed by President Dalia Grybauskaite veto, which provides for the government's right to stop the construction of coal-fired power plants already started, as well as to establish a "war zone" for the construction of coal-fired power plants.
Amendments to the law re-adopted by the Seimas will enter into force on January 1, 2019. The truth is that the ruling parties are already proposing to waive the 20 km limit.
This proposal is planned to be considered at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government’s right to suspend projects that have already begun is not planned to abandon.
KT will examine this case in a sequential manner - not earlier than in a year.
LeBron James's questionable statistics published at the Lakers Club
LeBron James's career start at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six defeats, and such a weak start helped spark rumors about the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
Yet such speeches reassured the president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, saying that the coach will not release, but to play better.
The biggest star of the team, L. James, should turn to himself.
While the striker's stats are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 scores.
But she does not tell the whole truth.
During the first ten games of the season, other figures highlighted that the Lakers play better when L. James is not on the pitch.
The striker has an adverse +/- statistic showing how many points the team scores or misses when there are certain players on the pitch.
When L. James is on the pitch, the Lakers have spent 30 points more than their rivals this season.
While sitting on the bench, the Lakers earned 19 points more than their rivals.
Currently, the Lakers are only 13th in the Western Conference, but a few wins can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia’s airspace in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region," said Minister Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO air police and air police reinforcement missions in the Baltic States, three of them in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish Eurofighter fighter jets were deployed in <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai in the months of May-August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia’s airspace in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that there are regular consultations between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda issues.
Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga has been the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Robles Fraga handed over the awards to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> on the arrest of R. A<0xC4><0x8D>o: I believe in the innocence of the man and law enforcement
“It was the most unexpected thing I could ever think of.
On the other hand, the authorities are probably doing the work that they have to do.
We all do our work.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is fair and honest, that no unjust actions should be done," Acien<0xC4><0x97> said.
A<0xC4><0x8D>a Special Investigation Service (STT) arrested on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still the director of the administration of Raseiniai municipality, took a bribe of high value, and in exchange could make exclusive conditions for a private company, signed a contract with the municipal bus company.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a or being involved in masking bribes in various financial transactions.
The Raseiniai District Municipal Council dismissed R. Acha in April of this year for the third time after expressed mistrust from the office of the head of the administration.
The former "manager" in March this year became a member of the newly-established Gediminas Kirkilas-led Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party, he suspended his membership of this party on Monday.
A few years ago, he unsuccessfully ran in the mayoral elections as a representative of the electoral committee "Your Raseiniai".
V. Acien<0xC4><0x97> says that the man did not intend to nominate his candidate in the next Raseiniai mayoral elections, but had not yet decided whether to participate in the municipal council elections.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> was elected to the Seimas with a list of Lithuanian peasants and greens, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
Politicians say they are awaiting further law enforcement action - and it will depend on whether they will step down from the Labour Commission.
“I’m not making any sudden decisions today, I think I’m going to make a decision this week.
I will see, if there is a need, what accusations are made, of course, I will make one decision or another.
Perhaps I need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, time will put everything in its place,” she said.
The representative of the opposition Conservatives in Seimas Radvil<0xC4><0x97> Mork<0xC5><0xAB>nait<0xC4><0x97>-Mikul<0xC4><0x97>nien<0xC4><0x97> urged Seimas President Viktoras Francki<0xC4><0x97>tis and "peasants" leader Ramunas Karbauskis to detach themselves from the statements of the group colleague Vidas A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission, moving her to the Seimas Commission to work.
She argues that the continued work of Aciene on the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission “would cause public distrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervisory commission”.
Sensual "Coldplay" music also attracted famous Lithuanian couples
On the autumn evening of Monday, a lot of music and film lovers opted for the preview of the film "Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams".
The event was attended by a group of well-known people: Jonas and Simona Nainii, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of one of the most popular British pop bands, Coldplay, which overflows with moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matt Whitecross met the men when they were still playing in bars and were gathering only a few dozen spectators.
In the film you can see still unseen shots from behind-the-scenes concerts, rehearsals or leisure time.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at the college in 1996 and formed the band "Pectoralz".
They were soon joined by bassist Guy Berryman, and a little later by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed the name to Coldplay and just twenty years ago released their first album, Safety, which featured three tracks.
Most of the 500 copies of the record were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of the Safety went on sale.
Now Coldplay is a world-famous, respected and beloved band, having released seven albums with more than 100 million copies sold.
Over the past two decades, the group has won 107 awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.

Only recently added to the team of Pasvolio legionary Y.Franke 88:93 defeat match with Prienu Skycop threw 24 points, rebounded 10 balls and provoked 8 opponents defeats, scoring up to 31 utility points.
True, the most useful basketball player of the week did not allow him to be defeated by the team.
The defenders’ chain in the pentathlon with the legionnaire of the Pasval team consists of his opponent of that day - Prienai team representing M.Gecevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
He scored 19 points and rebounded 9 balls.
Such indicators guaranteed the sniper 26 useful points.

Palestinian man stabbed to death by Israelis in West Bank
The soldier "prevented this attack by identifying a terrorist who tried to stab civilians and an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) commander," an Israeli army statement said about the incident at the Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron.
"The war has set fire to the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
"Israeli civilians and IDF troops were not injured," the statement said.
A military spokeswoman told AFP that the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
After the incident, video footage shows that he was not seriously injured.
A wave of similar attacks by Palestinians began in 2015.
Such attacks have declined in recent years, but there are fears of a new wave of attacks.
On October 22, a Palestinian was shot and stabbed to death by a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron.
Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU businesses
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries to facilitate foreign import conditions.
At the opening of the Trade and Investment Forum at the Shanghai China Import Fair, Mr. Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> stressed that in view of the signs of a slowdown in the economy, the common European and Chinese goal should be to "unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism around the world" in the face of "substantial trade wars that will not provoke" inflows.
"China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment is very important for the European Union - this is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said.
According to her, the opening up of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that the transparency of investments must be "higher than the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be an essential thing for the environment of new investment relations", - emphasized D. Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
“Corrupted capital flows should not be welcomed in any country in the world – not just here or in our countries,” she added.
China’s import show tries to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening its market and protects only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25th among its export partners.
Last year, Lithuania’s exports to China increased by 50%, reaching <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>180 million.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded 820 million euros.
Some officials are concerned that China’s investments in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence, and Beijing’s special focus on Eastern Europe is shattering EU unity.

Cause of Lion Air plane crash uncovered: relatives of dead in rage
The data from the black box of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air indicates that in at least his last four flights there was a malfunction of the speedometer, the researchers said on Monday.
The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), Soerjanto Tjahjon, said a similar ruckus had occurred during the last four flights of the plane, including the fatal one, when the plane crashed in the Java Sea on October 29, just after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board the plane were killed.
Many media outlets have reported mishaps during the previous flight of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact, the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," Tjahjon said during a press conference.
"The data from the black box showed that there was the same problem during the two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta," he added.
“There are a lot of rumours on social media.
Now we want to clarify that in the black box (data remained) about four flights during which there were problems due to the air velocity meter," - said the head of the NTSK.
During a meeting with family members of the deceased, Tjahjon said that the flight data recorder’s information was consistent with reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight had changed drastically when the plane took off.
The search team has not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said it had corrected the technical fault during the flight from Bali to Jakarta, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and an investigation into the disaster.
But he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Kirana, along with his brother Kusnan, who founded Lion Air in 1999, present himself.
Lion Air behaved improperly," said a man who appeared to be the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, a prosecutor on the island to which the plane flew.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
"Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn’t show any sympathy.”
After this meeting, Kirana rushed away, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identification of the dead.
Police medical experts have handed over nearly 140 body bags loaded with people's livestock.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Family members questioned why the airliner was allowed to fly two months ago, despite the failure of an October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, which frightened passengers into crashing down the plane immediately after taking off.
Lion Air said that this failure has been corrected.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they did not claim that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond according to the law so that plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Tjahjon said that the large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris spread over a relatively small area indicates that the liner probably crashed into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was intact when it crashed into the sea.
He did not blow up in the air, and the engines of the plane, when it touched the water, operated at great revolutions - this is shown by all the broken turbine blades," the official explained.
The crash of the Lion Air liner is the largest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan, killing 234 people.
After the accident, rescuers led from the rubble: a minor was also injured
On Monday evening, on the road, Cranberries - Plunge, Tilviks were hit by cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
Cars collided, three people were reportedly injured.
It is reported that a BMW driver, born in 1999, drove to the opposite side of the road and crashed into a car Mercedes-Benz, which was carried by a father, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the rubble by firefighters - rescuers.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz stabbed her teeth in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
The Presidency: no artificial facilitation needed for the referendum
After the senate approves the proposal of the ruling parties to reduce the referendum cartel to the first section of the Constitution, which currently has more protection, the president will veto the amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Ling<0xC4><0x97>.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular the articles contained in its first section, should certainly be a no lesser majority .
It is not difficult to predict that the president would really veto it," Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>, an adviser to domestic politics, told the news radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, therefore reducing the number of votes necessary to replace these articles would create a "negative precedent", according to Ling<0xC4><0x97>s.
"In the President's opinion, there is no need for any artificial facilitation, there is a need to prepare for the referendum itself, there is a need for more dialogue with the people," he said.
The Seimas are scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the amendment to the Referendum Act.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution with higher protection shall be adopted if at least two-fifths of the electorate votes in a referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens with a right to vote may amend the Articles of Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution by referendum.
Approximately 2.5 million citizens in Lithuania have the right to vote: half would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - one million voters.
The proposal came after the Seimas approved the presidential veto in September on amendments passed earlier in parliament that softened the demands on the number of votes by amending Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The cartel for the referendum is proposed to be reduced in preparation for the referendum on dual citizenship, it should take place on May 12 next year and on May 26, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Immigrants who regained their independence on 11 March 1990 are currently, with some exceptions, not eligible for dual citizenship.
The global Lithuanian community is seeking dual citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions, the referendum will not take place - a sufficient number of people will not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "Bra<0xC5><0xA1>ka", so they need to be updated
Lithuania's airports and road infrastructure are starting to shrink, so it is necessary to update it, says Transport Minister Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
"The air transport infrastructure is already inadequate because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius airport - this is not even part of long-distance planning, this is the minimum that we must do," Masiulis said at a transport conference organized by the Democracy Development Fund and the magazine "Valst<0xC4><0xAB>b<0xC4><0x97>" on Tuesday.
According to the minister, the next decade will be extremely important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, Klaipeda outer port was built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports were renovated, and perhaps a new airport was built.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an outer port in Klaipeda, arrange airports, maybe decide on the construction of a new airport.
We need to stay awake and start projects that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years,” he said.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that too little money has been devoted to car road maintenance in recent years.
"The state of the roads is not improving so far, because the funds are not being allocated enough.
We expect to build new roads, but even the most necessary maintenance, such as on highways, is lacking funds.
We have to determine the amount that should be allocated to road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Masiulis said.
He stressed that Lithuania’s exports of transport services rose 18.6% this year, and Germany became the largest export market, surpassing Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU country carriers have to return tractors to the country of registration on a regular basis.
“We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, proposing tow trucks to return home on a regular basis is absurd, because empty trucks would run in Europe, would burn fuel, would increase emissions.
Most of this will benefit the railways, as the costs will increase to the extent that some of the transport will go to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,” Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Communications, the transport sector generates 12.2%.
Lithuanian Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Disputes with Patriots
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced at the Seimas Economic Committee that negotiations had begun on the cultural change of the Vilnius airport building - this would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), Algimantas Degutis, called the deliberations of Mr Masiulio political pressure.
According to him, a building built in the sixties of the last century is a value, entered in the register in 1993, and not for politicians, but for professionals to decide on its deletion.
Mr Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of Lithuania’s image.
"To remove this old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step so that it can be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal can be built, so that the arrival in Vilnius makes you feel in a modern country, rather than in such an interesting, really unrepresentative of our country as an innovative one."
Mr. Masiulis also announced that in Kaunas it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal and to connect the airport with Rail Baltica on the track, building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to be operational in 2026, after the completion of the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year 4.8 million passengers are expected, and next year - 5 million.
Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.
What are Lithuanian soldiers doing in Afghanistan?
The SNB shall specify their tasks.
In total, nearly 50 Lithuanian soldiers are serving in Afghanistan.
Kabul.
The Kabul International Airport headquarters in the Afghan capital serves soldiers of the logistical base element, serving all Lithuanians deployed in the country, organizing visits and rotations of troops.
This headquarters also serves two Lithuanian Special Operations Forces soldiers, which ensure the interaction of the NATO mission leadership and combat support with the "Seals" in Kandahar.
NATO’s “Strengthening Support” mission is headed by military police officers who oversee public order.
In the same command post are serving Lithuanian military personnel.
They are responsible for intelligence, operations, planning and logistics.
Kandahara.
Approximately 30 Lithuanian Special Operations Forces troops are stationed in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
They trained the local police special operations unit, which serves about 150 Afghans.
Officers of SOP soldiers are trained in their own training grounds or outside of them.
"Aitvars" is also supported by the Air Force soldier, who controls unmanned aircraft.
Herat.
The headquarters in this city in the northwestern part of Afghanistan are staffed by military personnel.
They work in boards responsible for military training, logistics, intelligence, operations and planning.
Next year, direct flights to Madagascar will start from Vilnius
In the spring of next year, the largest passenger plane "Boeing 767" flying on regular flights will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Be, which belongs to Madagascar, based on the travel operator "Itaka Lietuva".
It is announced that Blue Panorama passengers will be able to choose from 259 Economy Class and 8 Business Class seats.
The new direction of the holiday will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milovskis, CEO of Itaka Lithuania, says that Lithuanian tourists are trying to offer new destinations for their holidays.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
For the summer season of 2019, other tour operators have prepared new travel directions.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will fly directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
The Minister of Finance on a possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
“We always have to be prepared for the tough times.
For the third year in a row, for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we are accumulating reserves.
But it’s also very important not to talk about the disease,” Mr <0xC5><0xA0>apoka said while visiting Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Finance Minister and Deputy Minister Migl<0xC4><0x97> Tuskien<0xC4><0x97> will attend meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how to tax the income generated for the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States until there is agreement at global level.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets submitted to the European Commission (EC) for the euro area countries.
On 23 October, the European Commission rejected Italy's draft budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the European Commission has taken advantage of this opportunity.
More information has been requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union: the possibilities for implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role for the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.

Traditions and customs of Lithuanian work
Recently it was 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural year-old Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D> (1897-1972) in Sidari, <0xC5><0xA0>iaulianu vals<0xC4><0x97>, then <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai gubernia.
In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how a life-filling national revival called many people of Lithuania, including the Bura<0xC4><0x8D>i brothers - Bali, Jonas, Bronius - from the depths of the countryside to the creative power to get involved in our culture.
Balis Bura<0xC4><0x8D>, who has travelled his native country with a camera in his hands for more than 50 years, has presented a wide and realistic picture of the customs, traditions, folk art and material culture of our country.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing vestiges of national culture and had a rare ability to realize the lasting value of his work.
In the photographs of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>o, Lithuania’s landscape, castle hills, everyday and festive environment, our people embellished the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication presents a significant part of the legacy of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>, dedicated to the description of national work practices and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite the two world wars and the severe occupation.
The manuscript contains very abundant descriptions of the works of interwar <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija, especially Kupi<0xC5><0xA1>k<0xC4><0x97>nai, <0xC5><0xA0>iauliani, Tel<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>kis, as well as the works of the Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kia inhabitants, their holidays and other traditions and customs of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>a.
Of the approximately 10,000 negatives left in museums and archives for this publication, more than 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos were selected, which were grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture, characteristic of Kupi<0xC5><0xA1>k<0xC4><0x97>nai, D<0xC5><0xBE>ukas, other areas of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija.
In Panev<0xC4><0x97><0xC5><0xBE>ys, a suspect escaped from a police car and was released for four hours
As a young man (born 1994) managed to escape from a service car, officials have yet to reveal.
He was arrested on suspicion of theft.
At about 4 p.m., police released a photo of the fugitive and asked the public for help: "Suspected stockbroker Dalius Malakauskas (born 1994) escaped from a service car in a robbery.
The man fled with his hands.
If you notice this person, please call 112 or 8700 60000.
Complemented.

The police department said: “The suspect is detained in Panev<0xC4><0x97><0xC5><0xBE>ys and is threatened with another case for attempting to escape.
Thank you all for your help.
tragic fate of a couple: died after a few hours of marriage
In the southwest of the state of Texas, a couple of newlyweds died in a helicopter crash just hours earlier.
24-year-old William Troy Byler and his wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died on Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 km northwest of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, a local peace judge said.
Strangely enough, the accident occurred after a flight of about 24 kilometers, just as long as the newlyweds were years old.
Helicopter pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, was also killed.
The youngsters studied at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday night at the Byler family ranch near Juvaldi and took off on a family-owned helicopter after the wedding celebration.
The accident occurred after the helicopter took off about 24 kilometers.
The youngsters flew to San Antonio International Airport, where they planned to board a plane and fly on their honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"It's a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," Kennedy said.
G.D. Lawrence has been piloting the family's aircraft for many years.
According to Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after taking off.
Its debris hits a wide radius on the steep slope of a rocky hill, and the hull remained "dangerously suspended," Flight Safety Investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said at a press conference on Monday.
Researchers are planning to take the debris out and then inspect it thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the tow truck and truck to reach the spot, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified and the preliminary NTSB report should be published in two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister Calls Entry of New Sanctions on Iran 'Historical Day'
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told members of his party's Likud parliament, his office said.
“Today is the day when, under President Donald Trump, the United States is imposing particularly tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran in all the time that efforts have begun to curb its aggression,” he said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would put a "decisive" strike on Israeli actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls “the toughest sanctions of all time,” came after Trump’s May decision to withdraw from a world power deal with Tehran over his nuclear program was controversial.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels per day since May, and to cut Tehran from international funding.
Israel has long disagreed with the agreement with Iran and says its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has promised not to allow it to establish itself there from a military point of view.
Other parties to the deal with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - oppose the U.S. decision and say the deal, as planned, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court again investigates the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist.
With the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the northern town, the court will hear the testimony of the witness in the accident case.
The Vilnius District Court ruled on Tuesday that in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses will be heard at the next hearing on November 26.
An acquittal has already been issued in this case, but the prosecutor’s office does not agree with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius city district court acquitted the driver of the car, Eduard Osipov, 79, of the accident of a motorcyclist who died, saying that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and had committed a serious violation.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor’s Office of the District Court asks for the annulment of the district court’s judgment and claims that the accident was the biggest culprit for E. Osipov, and the district court’s findings are unfounded.
The family lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist is also calling for the abolition of the acquittal sentence.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015, around 3 p.m., when Osipov’s <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia from Lak<0xC5><0xAB>nai Street entered <0xC5><0xBD>irm<0xC5><0xAB>nai Street and collided with a motorcycle driving on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of violating road traffic rules, which were intended to give way, and caused a traffic accident - a man who drove a Piaggo motorcycle on the main road died.
Initial police reports said a scooter driver was killed, but later investigations found that the vehicle was comparable in power to a motorcycle.
Vilnius city district court judge Rolandas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas told BNS that experts found that the motorcycle driver was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the permissible speed at that point - 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have predicted that the motorcycle would be driving at such a high speed," the judge said.
At that time, the driver of an honorable old car claimed to have driven only 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The driver of the motorcycle, who saw the obstacle, tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before colliding with the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia.
The prosecutor’s office believes that Osipov, who was driving from the side road to the main road, should have given way to the motorcyclist.
"Novaya Gazeta": Six "Vagner" mercenaries killed in Syria
Among the dead were five soldiers of the Syrian military and six people belonging to the military company "Vagner".
This is reported by the Novaya Gazeta source in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Army Corps was deployed in the area, which was joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries".
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request to provide information about the fate of Russia.
Ex-King of Belgium will have to pass paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of the former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a brief love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old king denies paternity.
According to the station RTBF, he can appeal to the Supreme Court in opposition to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - the ex-husband of Delphine's mother - is neither biologically nor legally the father of the artist.
For the relevant study, Delphine applied to be recognized as the "real" daughter of Albert's father.
They will give money to social workers, but they will not give money to social workers.
The Central Election Commission (CEC) is planning to allocate a budget grant of nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million to the largest political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), headed by parliamentary vice-president Gediminas Kirkilas, was established in the spring of this year, but it is not yet planned to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they can be allocated in the near future by a separate decision of the NRC, if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to the parties changes.
Laura Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aityte, the president of the International Monetary Fund, informed V<0xC5><0xBD> that "this Thursday is scheduled for a meeting of the commission to decide on the allocation of the budget half-yearly subsidy to the parties".
According to her, the decision on this issue must be taken by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.751 million.
The opposition Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million euros for the non-Parliamentary Union, about 0.55 million euros for the non-Parliamentary Union-Lithuanian Democrats, about 0.2 million euros for the non-Parliamentary Union-Lithuanian Democrats, about 0.2 million euros for the non-Parliamentary Party-Lithuanian Democrats, about 0.2 million euros for the non-Lithuanianical Democrats, about nearly 0.
Under the current law, which will also be governed by the CBI, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal framework does not allow only the LSDDP established this spring to expect to receive money from the budget.
The party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers will receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the coming elections next year, even three - the local government, the president and the European Parliament.
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> vetoed the relevant amendments adopted by the Seimas of Political Parties and this year’s budget laws.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the ruling party, Mr Kirkilas, and the leader of the peasants-greens, Ramunas Karbauskis, believe that parliamentarians will seek to reject the presidential objections.
However, this will not be possible until this Thursday's meeting of the CRC, so, according to Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aityte, "the grants will be distributed according to the legal order that has existed so far".
It is true that the head of the CRC has not rejected that if the Seimas rejects the presidential veto this week or next week and new amendments to the budget allocation to the parties enter into force, a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP, may be considered by the commission.
"When we make a decision, we will take into account the entire current legal environment, because we are the executive body that has to implement the laws that are being passed," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws would come into force, the government would allocate additional money to the parties under them, having additionally borrowed the corresponding amounts.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenka: activists of Handziuk murder sponsors must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and their more than 20 today - will be rejected.
Each will be very carefully checked, in accordance with the investigative procedures.
As President, I have no opportunity and no obligation to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with the youth in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he is most interested in having Handziuk's murder solved, and that the killers, the organizers and the sponsors of the crime "take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been re-qualified for murder, they are rightly and reasonably threatened with life imprisonment," the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called the public’s demand to investigate the case openly and impartially.
Poroshenko stressed that the statements of law enforcement officials in parliament should show that "the government is determined to hold criminals and murderers accountable, whoever they are".
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help to clarify the situation, and even more confused everything.
“I call on all the forces, both the government and the opposition, not to waste on unwarranted arguments and, God forbid, not to use this killing for public relations,” he said.
"Conversely, we now need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - in a way that builds public confidence.
There is simply no other way.”
“No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the situation in the country,” he said.
In July, Handziuk, who had fought corruption, was attacked and saturated with acid in the city of Cherson.
She was an adviser to the mayor of the southern city of Ukraine.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in the hospital on Sunday.
Without the police and prosecutors clarifying the culprits of the attack, Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenko delivered a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, officials received accusations from public activists that they were unable to properly conduct the investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"Today, I am presenting my resignation," Lucenka told members of parliament, reading his study report.
Parliament has yet to approve the resignation of the prosecutor.
Lucenka accused activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Handziuk.
Bill Gates unveiled a toilet without water
Introducing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates transitioned from traditional such devices to a water-free level with the 1980s computer revolution of the past.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet that doesn’t need water in pipes at the Beijing exhibition, Reuters reported.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilizers.
“The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in sanitation in the last 200 years,” Gates told Bloomberg.
The tech toilet was created by a charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over the course of seven years, a facility was being developed that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water, and the fund spent $200 million on it.
In total, according to Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now complete and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die every year as a result of poor sanitation conditions around the world.
Fighting poor sanitation problems, such as cholera and others, increases health spending, which already amounts to $233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates to the toilet presentation of a glass with faeces.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example "may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100,000 worm parasite eggs."
S. Slyva elected president of the Mass Football Association
On November 5, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Mass Football Association took place in Kaunas, where Sergey Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
Following the request of Anatoly Stecenko to resign as president of the association, an extraordinary general meeting of the members of the association was convened.
There were 13 out of 15 participants.
The main issue on the agenda was the election of a new president.
Two candidates – Sergey Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis – took part in the elections.
11 members of the association voted in favour of S.Slyva, two members voted in favour of V.Rastenis.
Slyva will end Stechenko’s term of office, which will last until January 2021.
Anxiety in France: People's deaths worry
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide, raising concerns over dozens of people who have been poisoned in the west of the country lately.
The health agency ANSES said the decision to ban all products containing the pesticide methamphetamine was made after a new safety check started earlier this year, before the poisoning waves that began at least three September in the departments of Maine and Loire.
As a result, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfectant chemical should not be in contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, about 700 tons were used each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Anjou region, where a lot of lettuce is grown, have complained of congestion of the eyes and throat, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but they did not rush it," ANSES deputy director Francoise Weber told West France on Monday.
Metam, one of the most commonly used pesticides in the U.S. and Europe, is considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to be a “credible human carcinogen.”
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is authorised in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether he had alternatives," Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand how difficult it will be for lettuce growers, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of methane in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
More than half of Europe’s 35,000 tonnes of salad juice is grown in the region near Nantes.
Next season will be "much less lettuce, radishes and pairs" after the government stopped using methane last month, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes producers' federation, told AFP.
Tallinn invested 70 million euros in the shopping centre with a review cycle
The new shopping centre "T1" will open in the Estonian capital next weekend, in which the local capital real estate development company "Pro Kapital Grupp" has invested 70 million euros.
A total of 130,000 sq.m., or 55,000 sq.m. of leased space, the shopping mall will have 150 shops services or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer’s statement.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius "Akropolio" (calculated together with the area for offices) amounts to about 110,000 sq.m.
"T1" - the first shopping center with a review wheel installed on the roof, says the developer.
It will start operating at the beginning of next year.
In addition, international transport gates will also be integrated into the territory: there are trams next to it, intercity buses will soon run.
The main rail terminal, Rail Baltica, is also located nearby and is projected to serve 1 million passengers per year by 2026.
Paolo Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that the global mall business is undergoing fundamental changes, and T1 has managed to be at the forefront of them.
“We’ve created a new generation of shopping mall that delivers emotions and experiences that aren’t accessible online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very center of the city, a gateway for travelers, an impressive and noteworthy attraction and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family," Michelozzi said in a statement.
A lot of attention to entertainment
According to the manager of the mall, T1 also has the largest center of entertainment and discovery in the Baltic countries.
A total of 12,000 sq.m., or one-fifth of the total rental area, is dedicated to entertainment.
An exclusive accent - a review wheel fitted on the roof.
It will elevate guests to 120 m above sea level - Tallinn is higher than just the TV tower.
After a review round, the fourth floor will feature the Super Skypark, opening here the largest batting center in Europe and the first Estonian basketball and volleyball court on the bats, the company says.
In the interactive SkyLAB research and discovery center, children are promised to take at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also feature a 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema, shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and moving chairs according to the film's rhythm, the sense of reality here will be enhanced by the sensual effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema hall.
According to the developers, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's revenue from tourism by 13 million euros per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Stock Exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group received sales revenues of EUR 1.8 million in Lithuania and suffered losses of EUR 350,000, according to the financial report of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market generated almost EUR 9 million in sales revenues and EUR 2.4 million in net profits.
The shopping center "T1" was built by the Estonian company "Merko Ehitus".
Cameroon: President Paul Biya sworn in for seventh term after controversial elections
Speaking at a ceremony under the auspices of 85-year-old President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, Biya pledged to safeguard the "integrity and unity" of the West African state.
The oldest African president to rule his country for 35 years has been declared the winner of the October 7 election, with 71 percent of the vote.
However, the elections have been overshadowed by low voter turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya’s inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including a principal, were abducted at a presbyterian school in the Northwest region, where English-speaking separatists are carrying out an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, autonomy was demanded in the North-West and neighboring South-West provinces due to dissatisfaction over alleged discrimination in the areas of education, judiciary and economics.
In 2017, after refusing to yield, Biya declared an independent state, the "Republic of Ambazonia", and raised his arms.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces have been killed in attacks by separatists and government response operations this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some across the border to Nigeria, but many have been forced to live in the woods.
In the October elections, only 5% of the voters in the North-West region voted, and 15% of the voters in the South-West province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya received two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative Primary Elections: Mistakes caused by inexperience
"When places are lacking - understand that the party has organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities allowed the use of their premises, but there were no voting booths everywhere, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
“Thank you to those who borrowed,” he said.
According to him, the complaints were received, but their content does not change the substance, and the violations themselves are not of a malicious nature.
“There were complaints.
Not all the people who participated in the elections had experience - it was news to them as well.
Therefore, not all actions were consistent with our order from this inexperience.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CRC that the principles outlined by us should be respected.
These complaints, however, do not give grounds for doubting the results," Anushauskas said.
According to the Chairman of the CRK, there were cases where the ballots were not stamped - upon learning about this, the ballots found in the ballot boxes were cancelled.
Some towns lacked space, but according to Anusauskas, the complaints and violations relate to several dozen bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it certainly does not make a significant difference to the election results," Anushauskas said.
It is said that the party members' turnout in the elections was 55%, while the non-party voters' turnout was 69%.
The two candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked on committees.
The results announced on Sunday also do not change - 79% of voters voted for the winner Ingrid <0xC5><0xA0>imonyta (16,418 votes), while for Vygauda U<0xC5><0xA1>acka - 21% (4441 votes).
On November 17, the TS-LKD Council will officially support <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97>’s candidacy in the country’s presidential election in May next year.
Trump Says He Won't Meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton earlier said Trump would meet with Putin in Paris, where the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War will take place this week.
But on his way to the last rally before the midterm elections, Trump told reporters he was not sure if it would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” the US president said.
However, the White House chief added, the two will meet during the G20 summit and "probably meet many times" afterwards.
Trump is still trying to "reload" relations with Moscow, despite suspicions that Russia is meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas asks for annulment of the VTEK decision
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas, the former director general of the clinics of the University of Vilnius, asks for the annulment of the decision of the Supreme Commission on Service Ethics (CSEE) - it recognizes that transactions were not declared in time and thus violated the law.
K. Strupo’s complaint was examined Tuesday by the Vilnius District Administrative Court.
The decision will be announced on November 26.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of the VTEK of 23 May, the BNS spokeswoman Sigita Jacinevi<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> Baltaduon<0xC4><0x97> said.
Strupas believes that gifts given to relatives should not be declared, he claims having understood the exception to the law.
In May, VTEK announced that K. Strupas, Director General of the Santara Clinics, and Silvija Strupien<0xC4><0x97>, Head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation of the University Hospital of Vilnius, had violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The study found that four transactions were declared in non-compliance with the stipulated deadlines: loan received from the bank in 2010 with the spouse, acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, gift given to the daughter in 2017 - apartment and in 1996 granted and not recovered to the natural person together with the spouse.
S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97> also declared these transactions bypassing the deadlines.
Persons who have violated the law of conciliation of public and private interests in the public service cannot be promoted for a year.
The law obliges to declare not only your own, but also the spouse's data.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of information provided by Info TV.
It is clear whether Mr. Strupas and his wife, S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97>, head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation of the University Hospital of Vilnius, properly and in a timely manner declared their transactions.
As reported by Info TV, last year Strupas gifted his daughter with real estate worth 125,000 euros.
However, the former head of the Santara clinics and his wife had not indicated the data in their declarations of interest.
Law Enforcement Strupps, along with at least ten other individuals, have expressed suspicions in the corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, for the successful purchases of public computers, software in clinics demanded from companies, it is disguised as support.
In this way, Strupas is suspected to have spoken at least five times in the course of public procurement in the field of information technology at the Santara clinics.
Mr. K. Denies his guilt.
Corruption suspect Professor K. Strupas was fired from his position as head of the Santara clinics in September.
By decision of the Ministry of Health Protection of Santara Clinics and Vilnius University, the working relationship with K. Strupas was terminated at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Santara Clinics will continue to be temporarily led by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until the competition for the new Director General takes place, which is promised to be announced later this year.

Schools already want to teach differently: promise fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in educational content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them at the forum "Education content change: foreign experience for decisions in Lithuania" held in Vilnius on Monday.
Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97> said that over 30 million euros have been invested in updating educational content over the last ten years, but the results are not visible.
"According to the results of the international student achievement survey PISA, student achievement is below the OECD average," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>.
The OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in the report of the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania is too focused on the provision of knowledge, not on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in general education programs in Lithuania focus on pupils’ literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also needed to develop children’s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
The Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Gra<0xC5><0xBE>vydas Kazakevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, presenting the changes in the content of general education, said that the volume of programmes starting this academic year will decrease, they will be more specific, disciplines will be more closely interconnected.
According to the Deputy Minister, the education of students will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30 percent of their unique content of education, the current system of pupils' assessment will change to an accumulative score, the weight will gain in the informally trained competence.
Smaller standardized tests.
It is promised that the general education programmes will be digital, easy to use, linked to e-resources, a task bank.
The update of educational content aims to improve the achievements of students in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between the achievements of students by a third, to improve the literacy of pupils in various areas.
As of May 2018, Lithuania plans to allocate an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.8 million to the European Union and state budget for updating the content of education.
It is expected that the project of general education programmes renewed in the academic year 2019-2020 will be tested in part in schools and will be implemented in all schools from September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism for the project of almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 million, implemented by the Education Development Centre, aimed at updating the basic, basic and secondary education framework programmes.
With a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.8 million for four years, the first <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3 million purchase was announced at the beginning of October to seek developers.
When experts criticized this purchase, it was suspended, and Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97> dismissed Director of the Education Development Centre Giedris Vaidelis.
In Lithuania - exercises on how to respond to extreme floods
Ten-day exercises to improve the response of the institutions to extreme floods will begin on Monday in Lithuania.
As reported by the Department of Fire Protection and Rescue (PAGD), the exercise will examine how the state authorities are prepared to work in the country after the state-level emergency, such as flooding: to eliminate its consequences, to coordinate the search for people, rescue and emergency eviction of people in the enclosed areas.
The exercises will be attended by more than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of the emergency operations centers of 12 municipalities.
On November 5-13, the preparatory stage of the exercises will take place, during which the municipalities, receiving information from the Hydrometeorological Service of the PAGD about the continuous precipitation and the beginning of flooding, will take decisions on the management of the emergency situation.
The active phase of the exercise is planned for November 14-15.
During this time, the State Emergency Operations Center will operate in the department, and in the state and municipal institutions - the emergency operations centers of the institutions.
After the government declared a state-level emergency due to the effects of the flood, the prime minister-appointed Operations Manager will lead the liquidation of the emergency, the elimination of its consequences, the protection of the population and property and rescue actions.
Mindaugas Kanapickas, deputy director of PAGD, says that the most important thing in the exercises is to check the readiness of the institutions to perform the functions stipulated in the legislation, to evaluate the possibility of exchange of information, to check how the state is prepared to warn and inform the population, the state and municipal institutions and institutions of the state and the state.
The exercises will also demonstrate the joint capabilities of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump large amounts of water from the enclosed areas.
The BaltFloodCombat module was established for this purpose in 2009.
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuriy Lucenko resigns
Ukraine's Attorney General Yuri Lucenka announced his resignation in the country's parliament on Tuesday over the resonance caused by the death of Kateryna Gandziuk, an acid-smelling anti-corruption fighter, according to the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
Under Ukrainian law, a request for resignation must be submitted by the Attorney General to the President of the country, who must submit it to the Supreme Council for approval by a majority vote.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Lucenko presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation into the order for the murder of K. Gandziuk in the Supreme Rada.
In a speech to parliament, he described the study as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandhi's death was being exploited for politicians' public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her hometown of Chersone, in southern Ukraine.
On July 31, an unknown attacker, K. Gandziuk, squirmed acid in her face.
On November 4, she died in hospital due to injuries sustained.
Protesters at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs are demanding an answer to what killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix said.
According to Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation includes 12 people who may have been involved in the order to kill Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study has been leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the study.
According to the Attorney General, due to the leak of information, the suspects received substantial information from them.
Lucenko added that he was personally acquainted with Gandziuk and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
“For no one to have reason to say that someone is holding on to power, I want to state that I am making a resignation statement.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine, and you in parliament will have to consider this issue," the newspaper Obozrevatel quoted Lucenko as saying in the Rada.
Lucenko added that "it is not permissible to allow duality in the country when the law enforcement system is destroyed without any evidence, even for the crimes that have been revealed."
Lucenko is considered a close accomplice of the country's President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on 12 May 2016, following prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of covering up corruption by top officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Z. Vai<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas meets with representatives of Orlen Lithuania
As adviser to the Minister of Energy Aurelija Vernickait<0xC4><0x97> informed Elt<0xC4><0x97>, the meeting will discuss the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not meet the trajectories set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans at EU level, accounting for 6% of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is relatively slow due to various difficulties, including relatively high greenhouse gas reduction costs and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%) and electricity at this stage plays a lesser role.
The Seimas has taken the questions of the proposal of the investigation of corruption to complement the appeal of the Conservatives to the UN
On Tuesday, the Seimas approved the proposal, which was recorded by Agn<0xC4><0x97> <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>, a "countrywoman" who leads the investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
Nine parliamentarians abstained from voting, while 58 were against 27.
The project will be further considered by the Seimas Committees, the main one being the Law and Legal Affairs Committee headed by A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>.
Upon receipt of its conclusion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of the amendment to the resolution.
The Temporary Commission of Inquiry of the Seimas, which is currently conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
<0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> proposed to extend this term, stating that "in the public space, significant information has appeared on the possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions".
In the draft, A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> describes "the possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Supreme Commission on Service Ethics".
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by opposition conservatives.
The ruling "peasants" found out that the Conservatives relied largely on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their appeal.
Influenced by the Supreme Commission of Service Ethics (VTEK), the leaders of the "peasants" blame former comrade Povilas Urb<0xC5><0xA1>is.
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas State Governance and Municipal Committee could have ordered the members of the VTEK to dismiss the former head of the Commission’s Prevention Division, Mindaugas Siauuris.
At the end of September, the Seimas constituted a commission to investigate the possible illegal influence of interested persons or their groups, the influence on the electoral process, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary factions, individual politicians, the activities of parties and social movements and the financing of organs of the leadership, legislative processes, public administrations, and governmental bodies.
It is also proposed to examine the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities and how they responded to it.
Researchers are expected to submit their findings by May 1 of next year.
There will be an election campaign for the President of the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the Commission, seven are representatives of "peasants".
Its members also appointed two social workers, one "provided", a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Polish electoral campaign-Christian Family Union.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the committee's work.
A new study was initiated by the president of the ruling Lithuanian peasants and green union, Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis.
According to him, a study conducted at the last session by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSDC) showed essentially the same things that the investigation needs to continue.
The head of German intelligence lost his position.
The 55-year-old Maaßen has sparked controversy by saying that his problems are the fault of the "radical left force" in Merkel's coalition.
As a result, he was not moved to another position, as promised earlier, but was forced to leave the reserve.
Among other things, it turned out last weekend that at a meeting of representatives of the European internal intelligence organizations held in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Maassen criticised Merkel's "naive" immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has defended the head of intelligence for a long time, said at a press conference on Monday that Maassen's comments were unacceptable and "disappointed" him personally.
Seehofer, who has been pressured by both the dispute and his party's poor appearance in the local elections in Bavaria, has asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen to the reserves.
A shark attack has frightened the entire island - a third person has been arrested.
A Queensland Ambulance Service report said the victim of the attack near Pentecostal Island, Sid Harbor, off the coast of Queensland, suffered "serious leg and wrist injuries."
The man was taken to the hospital by helicopter.
The Isle of Wight is the largest of the archipelago of the same name, attracting many diving and sailing enthusiasts from all over the world.
Shark attacks in the region have been relatively rare so far.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last time sharks attacked this island was in 2010 before the last series of attacks.
VKK has two new members - Visconti and Puksa
A. Puksa was proposed to the members of the CRC by the Lithuanian Bar Association.
He will replace Svajonia <0xC5><0xA0>altauskiena, delegated by the Association of Lawyers, who has withdrawn from the CRC.
Lawyer E. Viskontas was proposed to the members of the CRC, taking into account the provision of the party "Order and Justice".
This party does not have its own representative for the VRC when Donat Laurinavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius left it.
In a secret ballot, Puksa's candidacy was supported by 74 members of the Seimas, 5 were against, 6 parliamentarians abstained.

NGOs propose not to limit the publication of important data on candidates in elections
In an open vote, 95 members of the Seimas spoke out in favour of the appointment of Viscounts as a member of the VRC, no one was against, 3 MPs abstained.
It is planned that the new members of the RCMP, A. Puksas and E. Viskontas, will take oath in the Seimas on 8 November.
Skinny girls ruin stereotypes about wedding dresses
Skinny girl with white blows in the wedding dress - mission (not) possible?
Can a white swan flying toward the altar be larger than size S or M and still look attractive?
Plus the size of the reality show "Dead (r) Evolution" participants will already prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on a woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project will shed tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the filming site.
“There are still those who think that bigger girls don’t get the attention or glances of guys.
“It’s just a myth – my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me as I am, he doesn’t require me to have a figure that meets some standards,” Aurica said in a statement.
Wedding dress is not easy, in all senses, clothing - it is a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less self-confidence.
I can reassure you that a properly chosen dress model really solves this "problem", - said one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The fate of the girls in the project is decided by R. Kalinkin together with the whole commission - Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social media star Nagli Bierancu and TV producer Laura Pauk<0xC5><0xA1>te.
"When deciding which girl to say goodbye to the show, there is a lot of quarrel among the members of the committee - after all, we all represent different spheres and differently imagine the winner of the show.
The task of displaying wedding dresses has become even more difficult, and this - I can now reveal - has resulted in two newcomers who were certainly not inferior to the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense,” says R. Kalinin.
Newcomers - 23 years of scandalous behavior in one summer reality show famous Ieva and 31 years of exceptional beauty mother of two children Dovil<0xC4><0x97> - like other girls participated in the selection of "Dydis (r) evolution" and got into the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session for girls in the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were returned to the show by LNK viewers, who voted for their favorites on the television portal.
After receiving international recognition, the reality show of the beauties of the body is already taking place in Lithuania for the second week - here plus-size girls compete for the first plus-size star name in the country.
So far, there are only eight of them - and they all understand perfectly well that the winner will only be able to be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable reality show "Evolution of Death" starts this Monday evening at 20.30 in LNK.
Actor I. Elba is the Sexiest Man in the World
People magazine has named the world’s most sexy man this year.
He became the 46-year-old British actor Idriss Elba.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected, when he told about the new title, he did not take pride in it.
I thought, "It can't be!
Seriously?".
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought – yes, today I look sexy – the actor shared a laugh.
Speaking frankly, Idriss said that this title is an extremely pleasant feeling that has embraced his ego.
The British star believes that he often received insulting words and bullying, which made his childhood difficult, because, as he himself calls it, he was "very tall and inconvenient".
The young actor did not surprise his peers and became the subject of beatings because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
“I just grew my mustache and became the toughest guy in my city district,” Idriss smiles.
When a man loses being the biggest on the screens, I. Elba works as a disc jockey at parties held in Spain, and especially in the tumultuous Ibiza.
In his free time, a man enjoys Thai boxing and has a sense of fashion that he realizes by creating his own line of clothing.
The British actor believes that his most important thing in the world is his family, so he plans to marry his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33rd sexiest man in the world to be voted by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was given to Blake Shelton.
Man Killed in Drinking Distillery in Shirvind District
On Monday evening, a man was beaten to death during drinks in the village of <0xC5><0xA0>alki<0xC5><0xA1>kis in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>irvintis.
According to Vilnius County Police, at 21.16 a.m. a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbor during drinks.
The doctors found the death of a man born in 1943.
Arrested a suspect born in 1994, who was diagnosed with 2.53 percent alcoholism.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Managers no longer require a distance of 20 km to build waste incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration plant is under construction, near Gari<0xC5><0xAB>nas market.
Managers no longer pledge to maintain a distance of 20 kilometers from settlements when building waste incineration plants.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, head of the Environmental Protection Committee, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in the Seimas on Monday, waiving such a requirement.
According to Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikas, the "peasants" group, which has previously supported the provision on the distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment because of its rejection.
The amendment by Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikos provides that, from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built according to the requirements of the law for environmental protection and the protection of public health.
He acknowledges that the amendments have raised the President's doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of the residential area, it is obvious that it would be almost impossible to find a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built," the committee chairman said.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the presidential veto amendments that tightened the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants less than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided permission for the Government to make decisions on the future of two power plants already under construction, taking into account the public health interest.
The latter provision, Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, does not propose any adjustment.
The Lithuanian Energy Group is building a waste and biofuels power plant in Vilnius, while Kaunas is building it together with Fortum Lithuania, a company of the Finnish energy group.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
Talks on a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
Britain and Ireland's leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday over a complex issue in Northern Ireland that is hampering Brexit talks, Dublin said.
Speaking on the phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the opportunity to review the so-called safeguards agreement mechanism, which would allow for an open border between the province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider the proposal, but has rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the deal, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the interview, Mrs May "opened the opportunity to review the safeguards mechanism," it said.
"Varadkar has made it clear that he is open to a review of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review will not be a unilateral decision to terminate the hedging measures," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators are not finding an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain pulls out of the single market and customs union next March.
The two sides agree on "insurance measures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger-scale trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the entire United Kingdom.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain to withdraw from the hedge agreement unilaterally after three months.
But Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
"Three months or a limited term hedge fund is not worth the paper on which it will be written," he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels did not confirm information on the breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations after the announcement in Britain that the deal was hand-in-hand.
"I would say we are making further progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," May said in a statement.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schin also told reporters: "We're not there yet."
Nobel Laureates Call for Access to Reliable Information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a statement Monday calling for the right to access reliable information in the Internet age.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Senas (Amartya Senas) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglitz), Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebaydi).
"We call on goodwill leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions based on facts," the group said in a statement.
They argue that the "global space of information and communication" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion".
"People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of truthfulness of commitment, principles of approaches of pluralism and rational methods of fact-finding," the authors of the statement added.
The document seeks help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticizes “false news” but is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders should express their views on the issue when they meet at the "Peace Forum" in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories called for.
This declaration was prepared within two months under the leadership of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, head of the Paris-based media freedom and journalists’ rights organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Among the signatories are former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Sejm approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act, which provide that penalties for product safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the sitting.
Antanas Vinkus, member of the Seimas Health Affairs Committee, said that the new project welcomes the fact that the objectives set are related to better protection of consumers of products.
Its provisions shall also be adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, the proposed bill, is better and more specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of penalties does not always prevent further infringements, because entities who have paid fines continue to commit repeated infringements," Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments aim at increasing penalties for infringements, strengthening consumer protection, empowering market surveillance authorities and creating a clear system of product safety requirements and monitoring of compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the ministry, market surveillance authorities do not have the right to access the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, to carry out inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the six-month deadline for the imposition of fines and warnings is too short to determine the violation, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the penalties imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - in 2017 alone, 14 companies did so.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product in order to ensure its traceability, in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to identify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right, through public product safety controls, to access the territory, buildings, premises and to carry out inspections of operators who manufacture, supply products to the market.
It is intended to increase the amount of fines for violations of the law.
A manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor who has placed dangerous products on the market would be fined between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now between EUR 144 and EUR 1 448) for providing or providing dangerous services.
A fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000 (currently between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>868 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,344) would be imposed if the National Consumer Protection Authority (CEPA) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (currently between EUR 1 448 and EUR 5 792).
If hazardous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and 15,000 (now between EUR 1 448 and 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products have caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 (currently between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,792 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 (minimum fine not set), in Belgium - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>26 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600,000, in Romania - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>155 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,666, in Bulgaria - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 - a fine of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500.
10-year-old has a baby: a family member was raped
The incident in Colombia has overwhelmed millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world thanks to a cesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
For some time the doctors took care of them.
It still has to be some time before the young mother with the child will be spent at home.
"Based on the information I received from police officers, the child became pregnant after being sexually abused by a family member - a brother," the director of the hospital where the child was born told a foreign television station.
Police are investigating the incident of rape and violence against a child.
The Norwegian armed battalion took part in NATO’s drills in the most remote and harshest areas.
Soldiers from the Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of difficult exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
It is part of the NATO exercise "Triangle Connect 2018" - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the troops from the second battalion of the Norwegian military after the September 11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they are skilled at warfare in the Arctic, and these skills are especially useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and harshest areas, soldiers have taken part in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wilderness, but in a harsh climate, they have to put much more weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers in command say that their skills, how to survive and fight in such conditions, they share with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which resemble real warfare like no other, will teach them to be prepared if a serious threat arises.

The vice-president of Kaunas does not plan to return to politics
Former Kaunas Vice-President Povilas Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis, who left his job in the municipality and the “Vieningo Kaunos” organization due to his support for Vygaudas U<0xC5><0xA1>ackis in the presidential elections, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
“I want to focus on business.
I am a shareholder in several companies and also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to dedicate more time to the family," said P. Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis.
He also said he did not plan to participate in the upcoming municipal elections.
Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis had not yet had a chance to talk to U<0xC5><0xA1>acki after he lost the primary elections of the Union of the Fatherland-Lithuanian Christian Democrats to Ingrid <0xC5><0xA0>imonyte on Sunday.
"If we're honest, we haven't been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about the plans for the future.
Clearly, after Vygaud’s departure from the further electoral struggle, this stage of my life is over,” said P. Machiulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy on support for U<0xC5><0xA1>acki, only regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations".
Mr. Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis worked as deputy mayor of Kaunas for a short time in 2011, and later returned to these positions after the successful election of "United Kaunas" in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school "Erudito lyceans" and several other companies.
Workers in the castle: what are they doing here?
The Kaunas people, who have noticed the workers plundering the Kaunas castle, hope that the work of rebuilding the remaining tower is finally underway.
For the portal kauno.diena.lt, director of the Kaunas City Museum, Gabriel Su<0xC5><0xBE>iedelis, believed that the work of changing the south-west tower with a fragment of the defensive wall is taking place here.
According to the spokesperson, the roofs will be cans.
"Emergency wear and tear of cans posed a threat to the surroundings - people could fall and get injured - so it was necessary to replace it.
Roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so the heritage was also damaged," explained the director of the museum.
Will these roofs be similar to those that were a few centuries ago?
"All works are combined with heritage and other institutions", - G. S<0xC5><0xAB>d<0xC4><0x97>lis added, aiming to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time important and practical side - the ceilings must protect values from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution is chosen.
Before that, the elements of the castle of Kaunas had been covered in the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value," the director of the Kaunas City Museum said.
The contract was signed on October 2nd.
It is planned that the work will not take more than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November," the director of the museum said.
According to him, the value of the work carried out amounts to almost 24,000 euros.
This amount, according to the spokesperson, was foreseen in this year’s budget.
Work in Kaunas Castle is carried out by the company "Statija".
Kaunas. diena.lt is written, as according to the research carried out, Kaunas castle could have looked earlier.

The two countries have been conducting joint military maneuvers for many years, which Pyongyang has called “provocation” and “preparation for invasion.”
North Korea on Friday threatened to renew its nuclear program if Washington does not lift economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be "seriously considered," North Korea's foreign ministry said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told TV that sanctions would remain until Pyongyang renounces its nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet with North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.

The Eastern European Studies Center will collaborate with two prominent U.S. "brain centers"
According to Lino Kojalas, head of RESC, who is based in Vilnius and is already counting on his thirteenth year of operation, the consolidation in the US will enable the implementation of projects and will make the voice of Lithuania more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two major institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will arise, because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation and development of the Eastern Partnership countries that we are analysing are also their priority,” Kojala said.
The agreements point out that the RESC and the US authorities will work together on the preparation of international project applications, exchange of expertise and expertise, and prepare expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and brings together nearly a hundred top-level analysts.
The University of Pennsylvania’s latest global ranking of analytical centers ranked FPRI seventh in its category.
At the time, CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to advise and work in top U.S. political institutions, was ranked tenth in its category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality cartel," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the help of partners in distributing the forthcoming RESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review among decision makers in the US and in the public space.
The Eastern European Studies Centre operates on the basis of the projects being implemented and no targeted grants are maintained.
Among the RESC partners implementing joint initiatives are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.

Mexican Restaurant Helps Deported Migrants from the United States
The further away, the more Mexicans are deported back, and these find it difficult to adapt on their return.
“When I was deported, they took everything: my house, my car, my clothes.
They took everything but one thing – my knowledge,” said Victor Hugo Hernandez, director of the restaurant.
The restaurant board expects that by combining the cultures of Mexico and the United States, better understanding between them will be fostered.
Afghanistan Special Forces Member Shoots U.S. Instructor During Training
North Ogden Mayor Brent Taylor, 39, north of Salt Lake City, has been on vacation for a year to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the United States Army General Staff, but was due to return to work as mayor in January.
Another U.S. military member, whose name has not yet been released, was wounded in Saturday's attack that claimed Taylor's life.
Officials said Taylor was killed by Infantry gunfire.
Utah National Guard Commander Major General Jefferson S. Burton told reporters that Taylor helped train and strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan National Army.
Utah media quoted a NATO report that Taylor was shot by one of the trained special forces soldiers and that the assailant was killed by Afghan forces.
Taylor had a wife and seven children.
Its supporters will be deployed to the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday evening.
He had previously carried out two missions in Iraq, and this was his second mission in Afghanistan.
In January, before leaving for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisers and instructors from one of the country's special forces battalions.
Hundreds of residents of North Ogden gathered in the streets of a city with a population of about 17,000 to melt down their mayor, accompanied by their family by police escorts.
Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
