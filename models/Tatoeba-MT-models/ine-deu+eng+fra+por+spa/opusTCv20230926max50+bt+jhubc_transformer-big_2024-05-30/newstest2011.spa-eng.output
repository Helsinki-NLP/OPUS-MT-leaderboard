What counts? The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the bakery
The new councillors of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in the capital will apparently have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the members of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed colleagues of the SDG.
The period Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz "examined" the members of the new Council of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to check their knowledge of the slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The codified dictionary that used the Prague flower and political cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand those well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
“Who is Voldemort?”
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics," cultural councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> said during the "college" terminology examination.
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted in the same way.
Maybe you know the concept of "golf hole."
"Maybe it's the only expression of all you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, I usually don't use slang."
From the glossary, the definitions of which were published by the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last June before the voting congress of the SDGs, the editorial staff chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "bull neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "blind".
Three councillors agreed to undergo the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will in future be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t get involved in these things, nor do I intend to appreciate how civic Democrats have fun.”
“What matters to me is how we understand each other in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As it has been seen, Councilman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of the former Mayor of Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
To Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> the word "Voldemort" says nothing; the only term he hit on the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who immediately adds: "But I know it from the news."
"I'm going to have to sign up for a language course," he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environment Councilor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Afterwards, both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find that character; furthermore, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is soon revealed that this is the headquarters of the companies in Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, it indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that it does not employ such vocabulary.
According to the test participants, among the Social Democrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
“I asked my colleagues, but it really looks like we don’t have anything like it.”
"Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or make word games with the names," says the president of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose fellow party members call Hulda.
"In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza, but I don't know if my classmates call me that too," confesses his own nickname Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz put the name to the test and it works.
For his party mates, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the fraudulent elections during the party sponsorship, is nicknamed "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobil") by some of his teammates.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that Social Democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
The "doctor of the rights of thugs" apparently recalls that Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as it published in a pamphlet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually of advanced age, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "turn" witches are sent to an isolated area, so they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer such a thing."
"Healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help in the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, is occupied in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a catch.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso don’t know how to read,” warns Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week in Ghana, a neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman got stuck in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “Human soul eaters have always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president was still involved in it.
Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that allegedly had been related to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by means of black magic.
“To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the President’s personal escort, forcibly took men and women randomly chosen from among the Gambian peoples to the President’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detainees did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
Bakala tenant: heats up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, aged and young, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-story lease agreements: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving sentence.
All three have just been caught up in the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 CZK a month, the son will pay 4,100 CZK from next year for a two-room apartment with a second-category separate kitchen.
"Furthermore, there is no hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man points out in his son's new contract, over which he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains, half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which rated the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, the date on which it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, man only makes one ademan.
"Everything says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing laboratory for liberalization.
After the New Year will happen with the vast majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a number picking machine.
"Rental 2011", can be read on a bright button on your touch screen.
When pressing it, a little paper with a number comes out of the machine.
There is almost no time to even read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly thereafter, an older marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues, and similar issues.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the tenants’ mailboxes of most of the 44,000 RPG-owned floors around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers you in the cards a rental increase of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens at the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been running for a week, so it’s starting,” they answer, after briefly doubting, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The liberalization and old mining floors of Bakala are the most delicate issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were treated loud and clear by the Vice-President of the Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change my damn bathroom plate," the man mentioned in the introduction says.
According to the workers, for the moment, more than anything retired come to check if they receive a discount on the rental if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked for the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people,” estimates the window employee.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to conduct individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rental, an independent judge will have to settle the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed possible and fully compliant with the law," RPG said in a statement.
“Nobody is going to be judged here,” says one of RPG Byty’s employees, and a man standing on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I get a 13,000 pension and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
“Mr. Zaorálek warns you in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait,” he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
“Current rentals still don’t even cover the amounts needed to maintain the community fund,” recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio at RPG Byty, adding that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for landlords, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that elapsed between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014, the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, facing the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some highlighting data in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"Furthermore, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per month per square meter," the screen reads.
Just increase by 38% the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square meter," RPG says.
On 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not immediately affect rents, but will escalate in four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rental increase (see the chart) back in the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rental increase agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that there is also a small nursery with everything specific to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio numerous well-known buildings of Brno came out, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-kindergarten.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly in the baby boom age and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its workers as part of its social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini nursery was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-kindergarten is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (more than CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to keep the mini-kindergarten running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project took one year and the company Economy Rating contributed in the submission of the application for funding.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified personnel; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The kindergarten currently welcomes children without age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a "mini-kindergarten", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is a teaching and individual care, the contents of the mini-kindergarten program are comparable to the usual pre-school education program.
In it, children not only play, but also receive a quality education: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive atmosphere.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive when they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design ranks among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened staff marketing.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe Gaudí’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur, and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its shape similar to a skeleton, locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all of which are typical of Antoni Gaudí’s secession.
The cover of the house plays with dreamy lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought out order is observed.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snake and the twisting of the shapes continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the railings, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signs.
The Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gràcia, arose from the renovation of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of performing a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project ornaments appeared for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Güell Park of Gaudí, in which there are other pieces of the same.
Due to its organic form, the locals shortly after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of the yawning".
It is also said that, at the top of the building, appears the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating era with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Its forty-five-degree inclination may be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the building rules of the moment and did not let himself be influenced by them.
Still, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, upon its completion, the city council was so impacted with the result that it asked for it to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
Arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: just fifteen days after the request from the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
On the lower floors was installed the owner himself.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connection of space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the lounges and a larger group can thus communicate seamlessly, without renouncing the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with the light, white and blue tiles that cover the courtyard and candlesticks.
The game with the two colors brings maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which instead absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and refilled apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and the loft, including the roof terrace.
The price of admission to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of entry of other Gaudí constructions into the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and somier: women and men look for different things
Nothing like a pompous frame for the bed; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, i.e. the mattress and the sommer.
First of all, they must be complemented perfectly so that they are adapted to specific users.
During the choice, numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and mattress is placed.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that is usually not heated, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they tend to weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more often.
If the channels of the center are not properly aerated and, above, are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside.
When it comes to choosing a bed, customs are also influenced.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very tall mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and harder surface.
“Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have time problems with the nervous system, so they receive poorly information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem anymore, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelasticity.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn around like after a hard game.
It just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against wounds.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to your height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, a total of 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk towards the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert of Cechu <0xC4><0x8C>alouník<0xC5><0xAF> a dekoratér<0xC5><0xAF>, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics in furniture for many years.
In the double rooms, each one needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you need to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the beds at different heights, which is not always possible on all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with interior springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When you touch it with your hand or sit on the mattress, you should definitely not notice the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of somier.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can not wash your sleeve, which is often done today.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that talk about a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
That is why sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the cover, but it is better to add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although zippered mattress covers are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when opened they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling on larger models (and by one person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a fly weight and a weight.
In bed, instead of a dreamer, does he have a firm table?
Never, never!
As much for the beds designed for one night visits.
However, it should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulated sheet beds containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although it is always better to use a bed with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the stiffened lumbar area sheets may be reinforced.
Articulable sheet beds should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by the mattress makers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross structured or tray beds with the so-called multitorsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and soother, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mulled"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach to the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder pad or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, organic mattresses are fashionable.
The petroleum-based raw materials with which the polyurethane foam is made are filled with natural oils, e.g. castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biologically, in the case of mattresses, it means that the center is made exclusively of natural materials," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek of Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" themselves with brise vegetable extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "warm" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warmth.
Favorites nowadays?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold and viscoelastic foam makes it possible to manufacture mattresses from various areas that perfectly know where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns upwards.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as medical means.
The first to get this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and soothers.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is available for free.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cellular structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during the takeoffs the astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with the heat and hardens with the cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people tracking devices to control their children
The fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a lighter box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We’re all trying to tell ourselves that it’s not about spying, but another way to lessen the chances of a tragedy happening,” says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the tracking device suppliers in the Czech market.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone’s pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for safety reasons,” adds Pilin.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to prevent them from being controlled.”
"In the past, parents relied heavily on mobiles, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
“If it’s a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check if the child is carrying some kind of electronic device that can reveal their location.”
"Now it's the phone."
“As the use of tracking devices expands, you will also look for them, as their sale will undoubtedly be made with a lot of advertising.”
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the event of an impromptu attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can be helpful.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If it suffers damage, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The most expensive devices have an integrated tilt gauge, so if the person simply slips and stays motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, on which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that they are currently devices with a similar size to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for this reason, tests are currently being carried out with devices that resemble a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
“Or identify it after a certain amount of time, which can make the police gain time,” he adds.
Although the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mechas to surround the entire Czech Republic. But they only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to hold explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the service life of the wick is two years, four at the most.
The army bought the wick for explosives from STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mica saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of mica per year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnicians of the army, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high-ranking officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exemptions even the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and the army captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometers of wick.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have sufficient stockpiles for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of mecha, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stock for the 225 indicated above.
Soldiers of the rapid-intervention brigade recently personally complained to Minister Vondra because they say they have barely ammunition for various weapons, so even the practice of firing for money is limited.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also fail to understand that we are repeatedly bought such amounts of mica."
“But it’s their decision and they’ll definitely know why they act like that.”
"For us, the army is a good customer that we, as a company, try to satisfy," admits Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, the commercial director of STV Group.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends the hundreds of miles of mecha, saying he will also have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, of STV Group, indicates that the wick has a shelf life of only four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
“If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four,” says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition should be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of mica, it got a discount.
“They cost us 60% less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense’s shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of mica by police pyrotechnicians, who eliminated World War II ammunition or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask for only the right amount to deplete the ammunition before its service life runs out.
They decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wicks can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: you will have to remove hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I still live from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Businessman of the Year" contest helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun of Liberec.
Her success story seems to have been pulled from a movie.
And Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he brought together with seasonal work abroad and a credit from the bank he bought a house that was half-destroyed composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
"Currently, the value for money of the accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back into the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room boarding house.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four boarding houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said the number one entrepreneur last year.
“This sale of hotel opening licenses was greatly helped by winning the ‘Businessman of the Year’ contest,” Pytloun added.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends to everyone who wants to try some company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he still lives from contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
In total about seventy.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition.”
“It’s not, much less, my own personal success, but it’s the result of the hard work of the whole team.”
"Only my name appears in the foreground," Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly says today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had in Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone contest "Company of the Year", last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all of my collaborators and enhanced our confidence to fight the competition,” says the winner last year.
The history of the company Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the state proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not hesitate much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the competition in the media.
“Not only did our customers begin to consider the Farmet brand to be considerably better, but foreign partners also began to value the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year maybe it wasn’t Farmet just a show of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for trade results until 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And precisely 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, prompted companies to halt their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"Obviously, we are not getting rid of this situation either."
“Income fell by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must sometimes adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, even if at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite everything, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
"With the grants, we have built a research and training centre, strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained excellent valuations at national fairs," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with it, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a more calm atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the survey Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse moves.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a check on the insured's taxes," <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová said.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny business tournament and also begins to create a hobby among the general public.
While last year’s edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year it practically reached 4,000.
And it’s not surprising, since we still have several remaining legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in the number of papers required for tax returns we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic ranks 74th, that is, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated in the same way every year.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-award" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He wins the nonsense that gets the most votes.
More than one hundred were submitted for this year’s survey, including 105 nonsensical rules and regulations.
The examples were sent by both businessmen and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals for this year is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event that usually involves personalities from the political and social world.
This year, for example, the event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually puts obstacles on employers, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the mud.
In 2007, what most annoyed people was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate with three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a stand to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by its foreign workers from work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And on the third, the victory goes.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny contest is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
“In this way, we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the contest of the Rebel of the Year.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of Vodafone Empresa’s main competition of the year 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between the two, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example the disabled people, in others the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main donor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery that is especially concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; for this reason it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the year competition finished third in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment," explains businesswoman Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>stí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it backs up the work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona in Trouble Scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, a representative of the company.
They are also in good place with a mention of the laundry company Praní a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>ní from the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that affect their pension funds.
“We give benefits in food, transportation, improvement of qualifications and leisure,” says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D>, of the construction company Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the Year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest were automatically appointed who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
Organizers removed forms that were incomplete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition of Responsible Company of the Year, but are not disqualified from the "main" contest Vodafone Company of the Year."
“Individual nominations for this competition are not allowed, as this is a sub-category of the company’s top competition of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police have carried out several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
This apparently attempted to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of the rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million crowns for it.
"For the moment, I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen Attorney General Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that for the moment she cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how it may have influenced the public auction, given the little official information, one can only speculate.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra <0xC4><0x8C>erná responded to Právo’s questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
“This is a client, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public auction is called "Call for the submission of proposals for transfer of land in accordance with the law on land" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and, afterwards, the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the largest offer," the Fund's spokeswoman explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information about who was going to submit to the call and, since he is also interested because he acquired various rights of restitution, proposed to the interested parties on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
For that, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained from the Fund some land intended for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Afterwards, he exchanged them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the city had to intervene because, otherwise, blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay extra expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
As a result, families will have to withdraw several hundred kroner a month from the portfolio, starting in January, more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by about 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 crowns more per year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers have lowered prices, due to increased support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic.
However, the gas is costing moderately, especially at the time when heating is used the most and, therefore, consumption is higher.
In this case, they should also have a couple hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are rising across the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an additional 50 kronor per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay an additional 1,000 kronor per year.
Residents in Prague will also face a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Praguens will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
The prices of 450,000 leased flats in Prague, where the regulation will end in January, can increase considerably.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 floors in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, will increase rent by up to 100% from January.
The company will take to the courts those who disagree with the new lease.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year by up to 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer in mode, because it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get them drunk."
"Now, strong alcoholic beverages are fashionable," says Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, head of pediatrics at the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to get a bottle from their father from the casserole, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Vodka has the advantage of lightening with juice and not smelling so much,” he explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokeswoman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
“These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren.”
"In some cases, they use water that they took at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikan, it is thirteen and fourteen-year-olds who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics at Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when they brought it with 3.5 of blood alcohol, plus a mixture with ecstasy," the department's doctor said.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother wasn't even surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours," he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking on the part of their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot speak properly of dependence.
"Alcoholic is a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” explains Chief Pelikan.
According to the spokeswoman Jurinová, this year in Motol pediatric clinic were hospitalized until mid-November forty drunk children.
However, statistics show only those who come with severe intoxication and must stay in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after a medical on-the-go examination, go home with their parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink water, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs that should be mentioned: Halloween, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for the bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at a time," adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is prevented by injecting a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"These take it much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and it hurts them nothing."
“They only show up confused about where they are,” says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose good humor at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The transfer by ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients comes to cost about ten thousand crowns.
“I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell them directly to the children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job so that you would earn enough to pay for yourself that night,” Pelikán adds.
Health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a retrospective measure, which usually returns people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft found in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday to Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time such a device is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad to carry out internship or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version of the L-159T1, which so far was used by the Czech army and which was still in flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159.
These are still kept at Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>k, of the defense press department, says it is not yet known when the planes will physically withdraw from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 two-seaters were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seater aircraft.
One of the new aircraft was received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS pledged to add the aircraft to the equipment of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the EADS company is the one that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how they will use them in this context," says Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The newspaper Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny reported earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense directorate claims that the exchange promotes future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Domestic Aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Domestic aircraft and the last one should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
An index finger longer than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer journal.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
“Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger may constitute a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Accordingly, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same chance of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under the age of 60%, the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he is familiar with the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "completely demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, shook on Thursday with snow.
The roads and sidewalks are covered mainly by compact snow and the snow removal machines circulated throughout the night through numerous areas.
In the morning, the D5 road between kilometers 89 and 93 towards Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and cars, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was relayed by the operator of the Central Automotive Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
In kilometer 91 a truck broke down, in the 93 two industrial vehicles collided which resulted in injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the cuneiform.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must travel slowly after Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and enter kilometer 182 in K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
Stalls of several kilometers have formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Stalls are forming, for example, in Prosek, although <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí and Nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí Miru.
At eight o’clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
The Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> airport was closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday until 5 p.m.
Currently, it can already circulate on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brn<0xC4><0x9B>nska snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
Connections are currently closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment, it is not known when they will be opened to the public.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, should simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall is gradually reversing in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military is deploying a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, currently known only by the codename XM-25.
The generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and “change the progress of the game” toward its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise pointing.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25mm ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains makes it actually work like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when hitting the target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used, and when it throws its killer metal splinter rain, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point at it its laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of sight and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and presses the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the weapon is charged and the projectile is launched at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will switch their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, previously scattered throughout the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition, the collective office at Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, “In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important nowadays for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday sparked joy among those in favor and disappointment among those against.
The head of Frankfurt’s economics section, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this has earned him a “Global Player”.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the location."
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the city earlier about its intention.
"We have naturally offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic motives caused the decline.
Thus, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and the landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The property formerly used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of a controversial construction project of the spa town with the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years.
As a joint project of the city and of a private company of projects between the station and the town hall, a new entrance is formed to the city, which is in charge of the criticism in terms of the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001 they installed the investment consulting and valuation companies, the manufacturer of Software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the company manufacturer of computers Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, anyway Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been leased in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses, among others, the central association of electrical engineering and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Assange threats
Anxiety is getting more and more gripped by WikiLeaks.
The internet service provider Amazon has removed the revelation platform from its server.
Possibly there is political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly detained in England.
The WikiLeaks revelation platform is always the target of criticism, increasingly strong in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," activists said via Twitter's messaging service on Wednesday.
Just before, the internet company, Amazon, had deleted WikiLeaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon service website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks explained: “Perfect, we will use our dollars to hire people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported in a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
“I had wished Amazon would have taken these measures earlier, before the previous publications of classified information through WikiLeaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban the use of the server in other countries.
"Wikileaks's illegal, monstrous and disregarded process jeopardizes our national security and threatens life in the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has consistently described the investigation in Sweden as a plot by his enemy.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There have even been calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why he fears for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
The location of the founder of WikiLeaks remains unrevealed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to North American statements.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Governor Mike Huckabee said the WikiLeaks revelations should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, chief government adviser Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
There is a huge dispute between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridden and absurd” that Assange had asked the secretary of state to step down if she was responsible for ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website."
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was named an exceptional commissioner, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing “the important structural reforms,” which are necessary in light of the WikiLeaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of WikiLeaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream parlors are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
From the ice cream maker and ice cream maker.
The ice cream maker makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream maker pulls the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, there is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in the year 2003, so that the ice cream of his machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special more days courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in the ice cream shop itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk in the soft ice their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a California professor of this art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Ice cream master Luciano Ferrari then explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream cover of the national and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step in elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it to four degrees.
Then opens the faucet of the machine and comes out a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without washbasin?
How can you give free rein to some eagerness to experience?
Luciano advises that you avoid the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", has probably used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, guar bean.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you only have to buy it for a day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a noisy granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to pour flavoured ingredients into their merchandise."
"However, you must experiment sometime."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream from the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now course participants can use the freezers.
Luciano lets them each make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
That you know better does not necessarily depend on having more tofu flavor or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to taste dried fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group produces the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mix highlights the flavor of the ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream making is an artymetic problem: If you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to lower the sugar ratio from the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a utensil with which he sets the amount of sugar of the types of fruit (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to count.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
Not only does it help the tool for the automatic processing of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a temperature below zero.
Despite everything, all automation is left out as far as the small paste is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo stained himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were an uncontrolled mini-first giant.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it is only a matter of time that something like this happens."
Inspectors in a Complicated Situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
Currently, this issue is formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, and another EFSA expert have also been hired for years at the Ilsi association.
Consortia such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly on EFSA’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, placing him in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The provisions of the EFSA are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support and transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed its side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Office for the Environment as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, EFSA cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data is used, including some of the industry, provided they are of a high and technical quality, ordered in a report.
Experts working at EFSA are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the USA
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others, for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without researching food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not proven.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how are they going to be found?" asks the accuser, then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
She has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the U.S. and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck maintains.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday he was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to take down a large chunk of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing became debris.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
He excites: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tübingen in an earlier French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He has bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be disgraceful, they would grind the gravel or they would send it to the rubbish dump,” he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the shooting company.
He spoke to the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the cut 80 kilograms of brick, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also with the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart impulse stone has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He climbs to his all-terrain, makes a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, became interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
He is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the country’s largest antique stone dealer.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic cut sandstones.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge," he explains.
Dawn lime, yellow, warm, enthusiastic.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Mark a pile: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Beautiful travertine."
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the church of Sankt Blasien, toba from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple gadget and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich at all, immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to do the stone dealer, in addition quarries, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a stained glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the man in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be rescued.
Struggle of talents around great potentials
There is an active influx in the buffet.
16 students squeeze around sandwiches, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivaling and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a face-to-face struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Its mission: To hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And because universities don’t provide publications about their students’ skills, they try to spot exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A staff lady shares pens, elbows and folders with the VW logo.
It explains to enthusiastic young talents the internship programs and student jobs and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
“In turn, VW can meet students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point previously was in the technical projects," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not, they have to announce themselves and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students of the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacancies in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineer gap will grow even further.
At the audit and advisory firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election at the start.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly striving to pick and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple route alone would have been short."
For the Dykta hunting talents, the scores give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
“Some are nearing their end, and want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on the hunt, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students into the specialty fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, personnel manager for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The company Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
"It's very difficult to fill the vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter route is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several high schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The teachers advise that you can do internships with us or carry out your theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium usually can't offer it," says staff manager Stübe.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, attendance to children or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what you ask the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the HR manager also expects extra points in her ranking for her job seekers.
“I think the applicant is especially focused on the external classifications of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy that they earn a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers with more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity within the own staff.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with a gang,” Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the US state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby revoked its previous plans in an unchallenged manner.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast remain new drilling blocks for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What triggered this strict ban, which will be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce the U.S.’s dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling moratorium after the blast.
Subsequently, various peterole consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and tighter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is being reformed to its roots.
Obama also announced that profitable tax gaps will be closed for oil and gas consortia.
The industry is publicly announcing that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries,” says the result of the current survey conducted by consulting firm BDO – before Wednesday’s mining ban.
The American Energey Alliance complains about uncertainty in the sector: “No one knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new mining projects are protracted soon, at the expense of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marble, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of spilled crude have destroyed nature in Nigeria’s Ogonilandia.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari likes it.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the glow of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil spots float on the surface.
Previously, she used to pick up shrimp in handcuffs, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipeline.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogonilandia, is considered one of the most stunned regions in the world.
On the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation becomes obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, who immerses his hand in the water, will pull out some full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain are searched flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with a smell of gasoline expands in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says, hurricane Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison proceeds.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a relentless battlefield for years: Here more than 60 years ago the first European explorers broke in, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil workers.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: As they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were too quiet for the location.
Every two hundred meters, steel platforms protruded like strange water sculptures: "Christmas Trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At each moment a head fails, says Akpobari, then a constant jet of oil flows into the water.
According to experts’ estimates, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the crash of the ship “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and leaked pipes as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the conventional world, the scientist Richard Steiner blamed the consortium in 2008: Only the fault rates of the pipes are "on a multiple higher than elsewhere".
In a place that from a distance seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, oil is heated in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group’s head.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300 litre barrels of diesel per day: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $22.
The inhabitants of the delta are taking advantage of the fuel shortage in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and inexpensive price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who called the pipeline network that crosses Ogonilandia: According to experts, at this stage, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost per day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, which also include politicians and senior military officials, keep the best part in stores and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate about whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the lax way of production purely academic.
“If the oil companies had not behaved like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are shattered mainly by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like China."
Michael's getting nervous.
“It’s time you disappear,” says the muscular <0xC3><0x96>lmann.
"Soldiers can come in any minute."
If the army's special unit captures the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them with arresting them, if not with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This doomed invention has completely shattered our country,” Akpobari said.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big safety problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which could produce “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas’ Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing in early November were far more fortunate than you could imagine: Australian air safety authorities, thanks to their investigations, perceived a major safety issue in the engines of some A380s, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a sleeve connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected Rolls-Royce-manufactured engines belonging to 20 A380-series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal proceedings against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Sydney that allowed further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will carry out more safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept about three of its eleven A380s temporarily on land.
Lufthansa has repealed the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-deck plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada Across the Country Causes Traffic Chaos
Totally white Germany: From day to day it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets, chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter froze Germany: Frost-freezing temperatures hit almost the entire country overnight on Thursday, triggering traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 15-centimeter-thick layer of snow.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the snowplows are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind gusts sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the weather service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partly 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are in charge of wreaking havoc.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major street riots.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia the snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the lanes or the shattered catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue service attended the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesperson for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokeswoman for Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The snow removers are in continuous operation.
However, there are few stranded passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 beds prepared for them.
In many streets, there were already many accidents on Wednesday afternoon.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a crossroads in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred due to the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after throwing her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dusty and will therefore be rolled up in smooth streaks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly still be very cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutsche Bank arranged its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt bank district; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the renovation, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again," he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution is relinquishing its company headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investor of a fund of the house and then made the relevant arrangements for it.
Energy reforms amounted to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the newspaper towers renamed as "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold on a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been revealed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn the deaths of miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who claimed to be dead after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious at the site of the disaster.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was inserted at the site of the misfortune, but it did not detect any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue teams were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends commemorate the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand’s southern island.
They remain silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, underneath clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved half a dome in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, told attendees of the memorial.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume his son’s death until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners from Britain and South Africa were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does Gore fit into the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn once again explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip his enemies out of his body when his guts are evil.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are left to be carried away by at least one or two sentences or a pair of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offers to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has multiple audiences it is a pity that they cannot be discarded from each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the hairstyle drug dealer "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with some more humor in the mainstream or some less brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and sprouting guts can’t deter most fans of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and keeps quiet there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a movie distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
There is no escape for the spectators.
Refn conceives just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the bleak trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a small blonde young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
About midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the hub, hidden in a valley that rises from the river.
According to information from the U.S. CIA’s international intelligence service in late April 2008, a current reactor under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar was designed very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which the nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from within.
The reactor was recently in operation, he says, but it was still not equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely more known than at that time, the riddles grew older over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack, the CIA was totally sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in al-Kibar, but that it saw hardly any indication that there was a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several intelligence agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about an “assumed reactor,” although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible.”
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor ahead, a senior UN diplomat lapidarily replied in the summer that the IAEA has “enough material to have questions.”
The Syrians quickly cleared the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and cleared the ground in conscience.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in al-Kibar, which had been man-made.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state from commercial vendors right after the attack, which must have greater information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always hinted that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
The IAEA rejected it as improbable after particle analyses.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this, just as it has with regard to satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are forbidden a second inspection at el-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel, too, keeps a strict silence.
“We will never comment,” Ehud Olmert, the prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation into the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "is gradually turning into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, overseen by the IAEA, is pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams to be the key to progress in clarification, which must be “functional” with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
The inspectors have not disclosed publicly what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA has appointed Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as internals, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located in or immediately next to a military base, Syria for this reason prohibits entry to all three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear a record that the U.S. has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alert about the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
By means of satellite photographs, the IAEA has evidence that material is being moved between the three locations and the hub on the banks of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high-ranking position in Vienna said at least one of the teams could be “related to fuel production.”
But there is “no sign of sensitive activities,” neither uranium enrichment nor reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with unenriched uranium.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for the pumps, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As hundreds of cargo trucks disappeared from the ground, no one has information on where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometres from Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 as a radioactive waste zone, unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked her to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians made ground movements in the three allegedly suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA applied for entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians allowed, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus is also criticizing this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a kind of U.S. ambassador, feigns the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of “an option to which I am open in the future,” but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: it requires the majority of the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat reflected: "And what if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Times of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her yet unnamed debut.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women’s associations have been quick to protest, with which at the last minute they moved a few planned days of filming in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s war victims organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories given in the rape camps, and Jolie’s position on it delatas the victims enough about the script.
Her organization according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended the dismissal of Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, gave behind a ribbon and looses a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go after all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she introduces herself with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content is still inaccurate.
On the network circulates a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer".
It is certain that Jolie’s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can now achieve peace with the Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the network illegally, like many others previously.
Nothing as far away from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish.
No traces of sorrow
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout with joy as loud music resonates, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in South Cork, because players throw, and find, ping-pong balls into beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few air tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this odd drink game and discreet computer actually don’t make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with it, distract himself from the fulminant question, what the future will face him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a shooter he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," the young man says and smiles.
Due to the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, according to economic experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A big loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, comes a migration wave comparable to that suffered the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses especially the young, well-trained Irish, for whom so far everything is uphill.
The loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three in ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young immigrants, complaining that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a bleak future emerging because the government is only engaged in editing and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
“They cut minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to get new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
Observe how your peers go from unresumed practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
“For those who are starting to work, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career,” says the manager.
Pictures of a boy surfing in Australia and another practicing snowboarding in Canada appear on his website.
The message is clear: working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O’Donovan has known what it’s like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 fellow Irish builders in Germany.
Now they're building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January it will go to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay off a loan for his house in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as he was long ago from the first time he stepped on the threshold of his house.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m never so good.”
She laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with well-kept gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance there are large and expensive cars parked.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O’Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, “I don’t have kids to feed and I’m young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch.”
Civil engineers don’t like the complaints they often hear nowadays.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad isn't the worst thing that can happen, maybe with that we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let go of the future and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's been working in London for a couple of years now, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend in New Zealand be doing well?
But these days there is one thing that worries him all the more: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
“Just, not too much emotion,” he says and gives his beer a great drink.
"Goodbye, it sounds very anxious."
"Better we call it a party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democracy Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is more worrying than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latino Barometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
Around 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably above the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
Around 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has persisted during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only marginally increased in 2009 and has declined again this year, to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Chart 5).
Around 31 per cent say they or a close relative have been victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has fallen from 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, compared to only 56 per cent in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62 percent of Venezuelans say the same (and 80 percent support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the greatest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to garbage
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than foreigners feared trying to help the country recover from its troubles.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, ballot papers dropped in the sewers, electoral colleges destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The electoral colleges opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, said they were "relatively good choices in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that “we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and to his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The match is expected to take place in January.
All hope has not yet been lost in connection with the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has hardly any support, if he has any, has passed to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is devastating the country and more than a million of the earthquake survivors are still living in stores, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors believe that the election of a legitimate and popular government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has been evident, the Haitians themselves think so.
Advancing pointed towards the center
In the weeks that have elapsed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity index by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level it has recorded since its election in 2007.
Despite all this, it will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms. Fernández puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was accustomed to drafting budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened since Kirchner’s death due to a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissident members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs. Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
Accordingly, the 2010 budget will be applied to the coming year, giving the President even more room for action when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of the trade unions, place it close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez now moderate these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to enter into an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as usual.
However, last month the Minister of Economy, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund will offer “technical assistance” to develop a new price index for domestic consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win another election, you will have to decide whether or not you repudiate, with tranquility, many of your husband’s policies.
Half hurrah for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, went on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a champion of sentiment across the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three out of five mayoral elections, it failed to win the majority of votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has leaned toward complete independence from Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in municipalities.
In the elections, the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections were seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with banners and light-clad girls dancing.
Neither was the mysterious attempted murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicion about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this was not about the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing and job creation plans.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Accordingly, the KMT often avoids advertising its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that his policy towards China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Government of Beijing is expected to continue bribing them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into lockdown.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing to do is to wait for the 2012 presidential election to happen.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on corruption charges.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly urged explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PDP candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything it can to show that he can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to create a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, as long as negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr Chen’s intercession, the PPD will have difficulty choosing from its potential candidates.
The KMT must also take a conscience test.
Mr. Ma’s assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity appears to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing disparities between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will restructure its cabinet as well as local teams.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan’s support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist Revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys’ surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Revelation Artist.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure in jazz since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives some thought, but respects the Grammys rules that he must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly meant a great breakthrough and, given his light and pleasant vocal style as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, one can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the path to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent to the latter have been the Gramy range for voters.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer's "Historicity" Trio, an exciting and magnificent record that was one of last year's favorites.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite New Orleans star and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably toward fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's wild punk earned well-deserved recognition in the big band category, competing against the Billy Childs Ensemble's great camera jazz and the always-risk Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Classical Album Direction
Classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories spanning orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classic Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classic music album are Bruckner for the Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra; the Chicago Symphony "Sy and Synergy" Artists.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Orchestra" by "The Enchanted Wander" and "The Enchanted Orchestra".
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, which is about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "The Angels" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to be played in mandolin by Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
“He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets approval from the commission of planning
The mosque project for Temecula has gained unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics attacked the project saying it promotes terrorism and stalls.
However, members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'is, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“The truth is, as an American citizen, I’m proud of myself.”
"It shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They’re just talking too loud.”
“There are wonderful people in this valley.”
The meeting began at six in the afternoon and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people interceding for or against the center, virtually the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“The United States no longer exists,” reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Freedom dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests elsewhere in the country, including near Zone Zero, the New York area where the September 11, 2011, attacks occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of nearly 135 families has been living together seamlessly for years in Riverside County, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe poses the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it demonstrates that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it something very peculiar, although it lacks little to be a kind of really 'alien' way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of Thursday's journal Science.
For a long time, it has been considered that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated widespread speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be as fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute one for the other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, to put it another way, appeals to biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but the fact of showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic may naturally exist, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example that would prove to work had never been found.
Arsenic was more common in the early eras of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"So it suggests that there might be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The missing stolen dogs found in Compton
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Officers said on Thursday.
The four race dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met late Wednesday night, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Department spokesman Steve Whitmore.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They're back with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is underway.”
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the area’s competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to be exhibited in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the almost two-month tour that the couple performs participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They were carrying three other dogs (a boxer breeder, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany), who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, endowed with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while MGM restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to clear approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and television shows.
The ruling on Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal hurdles for MGM to relaunch under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a reduced study.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In reality, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The study’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management necessary to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron president and business recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial hardships and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion the creditors were seeking.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreement, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the companies of Moelis and Cooper will receive multi-billion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive a “successful fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on The Hobbit, along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to make a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to settle a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys Wants to Keep Your Budget Balanced for Gifts
While the iPad is the top candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed perhaps by the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant bump in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic beads decorated jump ropes, or about 48 Play-Doh cans.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see which electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button-powered toys are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are for Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and over) are teddy bear-sized toys that sing a note when their bellies are tightened.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to compose a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once it starts squeezing, it can’t stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative wheel-articulated feet with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a notebook of self-correction exercises occurring.
If you are suspicious of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games don’t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years old), it’s the first major upgrade of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-type system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to arm words by putting the blocks in line before time runs out; it’s great for an improvised word-arm competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at the Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6-12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include wheeled skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush, the Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the latest in a line of button-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly over 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of law enforcement in China is promoted
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin made his way to a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the corpulent police officers of China’s urban order, feared and despised for their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firms!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "how beautiful the girls are!"
Four girls who barely spent adolescence with identical white gloves and olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white striped mouldings.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," Mr. Tang said, scornfully.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
A city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grayish-green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a snack cart, and watched it with the cheek constantly frowned for half an hour, until the strolling salesman picked up his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rude police a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s petty respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province beat a passerby to death after he used his cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how to effectively whip criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a traveling melon seller from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a quarrel with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, introduces Chinese-trained inspectors who attack street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar in the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded “a really meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above average, more than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
"His image is the important thing," a district official told Rednet.com, a nearly governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
Female Chengguans are like florists, she said, adding, “in addition to being florists, they will have other responsibilities.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city’s district administration office, is not eager to back up that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job announcements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, the disabled or disfigured should not appear.
“We can’t allow a picky or a junkie to come here to work,” Mr. Zheng said.
“Your image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colorful cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His co-worker with pits, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said, “Our work must present the image of the city.”
They also don’t oppose their fixed-term work, they said, because they harbor career ambitions greater than simply evicting vendors into the alleyways where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen strolling vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many sandwiches or bowls of tofu as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his cart thrown by bicycle with noodle trims.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is more or less the same every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his spare time.
"Very routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after the false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen police officers or Chengguan officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were tossed or set on fire.
For now, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is barely guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was screaming loudly.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the bad-faced officers made way to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old coordinator assigned to the men's squad, stood behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 years of age or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we struggle physically," Mr. Li said with total naturalness.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it felt "certainly happy" with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him on this issue.”
The Department of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, email and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, get lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was barred under the law from lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door status,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon prosecution by Steve Sen.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins declined to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, alleging that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was just a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "knocking" the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he hired Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, she said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the Department of Justice’s lead and complete its investigation.
"Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire Appeal Will Target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the appalling testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely-followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is set to come to an official conclusion, with the judge’s imposition of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed letters in court outlining the arguments of appeals likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims is that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, senior defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
Chief Justice Jon C. Blue, of the State Superior Court, laconically rejected the claims in a ruling last week, saying the media were “carefully controlled” and there was no evidence that the jury was carried by the passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that coverage of famous cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard v. Maxwell case, that there was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime was inspired by the TV show and the movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media” on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report saying it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them horrifying photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of intense process coverage can attract most interest.
They observed in a rejection to the filing verdict last month that the case dominated news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually cast fire to the fire of emotion on the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps across the state.”
Their attention in the coverage of Tweeter is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint that the immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly was a ludicrous view that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future trials.
But some lawyers said appeal courts often felt attracted by the arguments about adaptation required in courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which revoked Dr. Sheppard’s conviction due to the coverage of the trial, and made clear that they would require that the new media require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the 21st century Sheppard vs. Maxwell case.”
Can civility stretch a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, this week has sparked a bit of civility in Washington.
Is it a foreshadowing of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a swift return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders yielded no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But as they all say, it was at least a courteous discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was equally civilized, despite remaining political differences between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a trial period, probing each other to identify signs of co-operativeness and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voters’ patience for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent evaluations of the same by the participants were done with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed with respect to the way things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then extinguish.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Likewise, there is likely to be a commitment to extending unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t make people believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s White House meeting, there is increased optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontational one,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012.”
The motives have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises of cutting state spending and nullifying the new health law.
Those support lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting expenditure.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have handled one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forced the issue of the deficit into the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials in the panel, suggesting that on tax issues there are, at least at present, few bases or desire for engagement.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama over budget, taxes and medical care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks they are losing will likely change course and seek engagement.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” leaving a portion of the bribes and protection money directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has dubbed the “vertical authority,” takes its share as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blamed him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libel over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, he said: “It’s crazy, it’s bullshit, it’s annoying.”
According to surveys, the Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
“The direct links of the Moscow City government with crime have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional’, and to claim that the government functions more like a cleptocracy than a government,” the statement said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means ‘ceiling’ or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
“Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS raises money from the largest companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not take place until late at night time in Moscow, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way."
Veterans of the Red Khmers forced to face the past
In a poorly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everybody loves Ta Mok here."
“He was a good leader and cared for his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers surrendered to the government, long-lasting loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Khmers to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Khmers, sentenced the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the Anlong Veng Red Khmer veterans, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Red Khmers, but they can do nothing,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During the reign of the Cambodian Red Khmers, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began deserting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the shallow soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gained little benefit after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
“They were raised with no concept of doing business.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating herself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Khmers was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok gave them all to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to self-supply."
The current Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Center that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent muggy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Khmers.
She claimed that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Khmers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Red Khmers, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the High School History textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Khmers, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Khmers retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black smoke covered by an oxidized tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here over a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old mobile phone salesman on the side of the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him,” he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to Pol Pot’s last resting place, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of qualified uranium for weapons
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will relinquish its reserves of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations with Belarus had been carried out in the past two months to remove 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for armament from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal was "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapon-qualified uranium) and low-enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material ... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the installation of low-enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said “this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence” that led to the deal signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapon-qualified uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential relaxation.
“While progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the country’s progress and its citizens.”
The Spanish government did not make repairs to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not make repairs to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading to Guantanamo on Spanish territory, the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the leaked documents (cables) by WikiLeaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed so that "they can demonstrate that they are exercising appropriate surveillance over foreign planes that pass through Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting took place between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “unpredicted piled up,” Aguirre reports on a cable.
The then foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would like to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the embassy that he would not try to block the judge’s initiative to ask for the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern about “apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors,” rather than declassified information from the CNI or the Defense Ministry.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric".
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this matter.
“Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government,” he said.
The parricide confession complained on the network of the "agobio" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he used as a child, he communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two naturals of Noia, the people of Coruña from which she comes.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know his sentimental life, which ABC rebuilds through the testimonies of his relatives.
The 30-year-old galician began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tuñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, soon it was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him have a DNA test.
It wasn’t long before he met another boyfriend.
The chosen was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But by the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and cheeky, because I have come to work."
“When I told him it felt good, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the kid all day and not have the freedom to do whatever he wants.”
Then, talk about a message on your mobile that you just received: “I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child.”
She complains: "If he doesn't like me to leave the kid with my mother, I'll pick him up when he gets back."
In May, he talks about returning to his people: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'll only be until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to present myself to a job so I don't lose it."
He explains that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"He's going to be with who he owes me, that is, with me, and I'll never think of leaving him with anyone but my mother again," he said.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the kid) to some summer classes, and so I'll save myself a little kangaroo paste."
The 17th, memoirs and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
“Alberto says he sent you I don’t know what videos to email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck yourself.”
30, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money."
On the internet there are messages of her in blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
I even had one of my own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where it was called "Muki the jailer."
"Terror in Galician (title) ".
The last man who lived with her, keeper of the jury, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything happened because he didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered yesterday the provincial penitentiary of Palma, from the centre of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "nor did he intend to cause any harm to the minor".
Earlier, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs experienced in the recent autonomic elections, the Catalan PP already has the view put on the generals because, whether it advances or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation gets in those elections usually doubles the ones it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610.473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomy, the figure amounted to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been fueled by a crossover of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less.
These calculations would establish that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one deputy – now it has three – while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate meeting will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in ending socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relief at the head of the Diputación de Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 .
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority nor the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be inconceivable that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - you need to get 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can take the lead in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has stood only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Police Information Commissioner in 2008 in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar at the Last Bomb" (Laskar and Taiba).
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that with the “Operation Kampai” the falsification apparatus of Al Qaeda at the international level has been “weakened” and, therefore, “its operational capacity”.
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were counterfeited and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their “combatants” can cross the European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence the investigations have involved, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not excluded that in the EU territory in the coming days strikes similar to those developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), in Thailand another was developed at Butuqi and Ebuh Eharhan with the capture of the Muharmans.
These were the ones who ran the cell set up in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole tourist passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
In the media of the investigation it is underlined that, for the moment, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, some thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized ample documentation.
The PP demands that Mas park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to do without the adventures of the philosopher-sovereignist who wants to lead the country.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the assurance that he has obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make himself wanted, because the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investiture vote.
From a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas keeps these days with the rest of political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture “there will have to park all the sovereignist and independentist speeches”, as well as the economic concert – similar to that of the Basque Country – that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to slimming down the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomic administration and eliminating the tax on inheritances and donations.
The details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that his killer killed more than 11 elderly
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there employed killed at least eleven elderly people who was in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exert the accusation against the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible".
In addition to the social stigma that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the jailer in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then she has not stopped killing.
The judge pointed out in the auto that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by phone.
La Caritat, through its director, blatantly denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures can not at any time have been the cause of what has happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is not a single indication that there has been an reckless action by any person other than the accused himself."
The already-baptized "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he was killed by an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed with the help of a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to the medicines.
The insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to give them death.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the murderer, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That’s why they say they make themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday that warned “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The peripheral differentials have tightened and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying sign.
What has happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses it recovers but motivated by the closure of short positions and very speculative.
The institutional investor will take time to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the end of the ineffective public debt purchase plan and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures on a timely basis, leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect to extend current liquidity measures “at least until March” and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As at their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even contemplated buying bonds and collapsed markets, tomorrow the story could repeat itself.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, the bazooka announced on Monday and Wednesday said it had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday the letter auction for a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued $500 million at 5.28%, versus $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment behind Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still has not enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tensions in the face of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which a political commitment is needed that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains that the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and convincing and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for an Aid Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury have more than 40 billion in available liquidity that in March, at very expensive rates and closes you access to the markets sine díe.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar’s wife, “in addition to being it, to seem it.”
Courage, we can.
Eulen’s president will challenge Vega Sicilia’s board requested by his children
The storm does not diminish in the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "null of full right", the El Enebro judicial board of the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to enforce their majority and get with the management bodies of the company owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesus David and María José are fine-tuning the legal drum for the new judicial chapter in their dispute over control of the group.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company to the company does not seem willing to yield in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
His board of directors was dismissed by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors at this year’s January 18 shareholders’ meeting and whose appeal is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The Judicial Board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunders in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is rated by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural cunning, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, try to validate and sanitize the radically null board of January 18", according to its official.
This argument will be the basis for, once the board is held, proceeding to its challenge by considering it to be "invalid in full".
The same protagonists, who keep a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to have the magistrate convene a board in June.
In El Enebro, property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This issue is the substantive issue that the judge must decide once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which there is no date yet set.
Red Bull wins F1 with Siemens secret weapon
A software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a new squad and, despite the upward trajectory of the last few seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari.
Without underestimating the ability of the eventual champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has placed in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft, or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in his Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out “in a few hours, almost in real time,” the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the squads in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team today employs 180 young highly qualified professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the bolides.
The Siemens CEO explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull’s cars except the engine, which is entirely Renault’s responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the figure of $40 million that every Formula 1 team can spend as much as possible in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has assembled the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolides in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The workforce for this task amounts to 580 people, including his two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero is undoubtedly recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drinks brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their null notoriety.
Steve Nevey, the factory’s chief technology officer, said five years ago that R&D advances in wagon cars accounted for 50% of the wins and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and the technology adds up to 85% of the success, while the drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers as "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP to install 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of a network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran Vía Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom he has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for installing the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with interactively touchable products), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering global pilot program that is in charge of solving possible problems with HP’s computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
“This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, as large companies already have contracted technical assistance services,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets to 'steal' one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Despite this, it foresees a fall in interest margins, which will be attempted to offset in part by commission increases and the credit price.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private customers in three years, its outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will last for three years.
The goal, in addition to surviving without resorting to public aid from FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers -700,000 if you discount those who can leave the bank -, its large outstanding subject, since so far it had pampered more SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year, it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the foundations of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges the bank will expose when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has upset all the plans of global banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his master plan Optima, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made that will extend it one more year.
Customers letting go of the savings boxes will be their main goal.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a “difficult and transcendental year.”
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes the liabilities war — which penalizes margins — is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and cash registers are paying for their issues to get liquidity are already moving to the price of credit to compensate for the drop in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a factor of pressure on credit.”
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders Thursday to his network to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials -see CincoDías of November 22 and 27-.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "larger sizes are going to be required."
“Next year, everything will move,” he said.
It claims that capital needs are “highly increased” and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution enters in red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in the raising of funds in the face of new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary shutdown of markets, it undermined what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rests, which cushion the crisis.
The ECSC dismisses a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out a wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks started, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Bank group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in that too," the manager said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the process of concentration is taking place "at the fastest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is going to happen in the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain".
“Moving from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much larger to meet Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The manager noted that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking industry came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoebox and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lottery.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has added to the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budget rigour, fines to infringing countries, possible suspensions of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government pulled a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany believed needed to be done (fiscal rigorous plans and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second in the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece’s rescue decision.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published opinion were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the EU treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reforming the Union that will make those measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although he now has to take measures with which he may not agree very much, from that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which infringing countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand.
It is not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst we could do under these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquility.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity that has been given to us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has understood this as well, and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home has opened the way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t look like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded of unserious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sports and Fraud
Fools like Alonso and Ramos at Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The alleged expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether or not such behavior is anti-sporting and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, a few minutes away from finishing the game (which their team had clearly already won), the two players deliberately lost time in drawing wrong paths to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and can pass card cleansing to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team’s coach, José Mourinho, with two matches, and with different financial amounts the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been played by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and which in past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, apparently by Mourinho, who adds a more technical episode to his story.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such behavior, not expressly prohibited by the regulation, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions commit fraud of the law; in fact, they are actions respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that the sports spirit comprises is the physical integrity of the opposing players, aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with the clean game is to prevent the team of the offenders from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not conform to what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud, because his violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but precisely his action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders get in the deliberate wrongdoings examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that you do not put the opponent in a disadvantage situation or get a benefit in the same game, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the equipment can be eliminated at the first change, and in addition with this performance the players meet a penalty game and move to the second card cycle, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with a less than in the first cycle.
So, going rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, which is part of making strategic decisions that favor to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the case that concerns us, the players did not act to evade the enforcement of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the boundary between ingenuity and fraud is diffuse, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the transmission of the directive was carried out to provoke them.
The damage to the principles of sport caused by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture the Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th days.
The celebrations self-supplied by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, proliferate.
Like the turrón and the lottery, with the arrival of December also come back the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but that due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 euros and dinner.
To finish complicate the accounting, this year’s calendar (when New Year’s Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (16 and 17) and barely moving for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean cows stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to do without tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restoration Board, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to predict what the festivities of this month will be.
"People think about it a lot before they book."
“He wants to leave but has the alerts on the subject of prices on fire,” he points out.
The business will go well “to those who give quality at a good price and with good service,” he adds, recalling that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A survey of several central establishments found the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is a real boom of applications for that Friday, with the pretense of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
“We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes ranging from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they say.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 venues, they remain optimistic after detecting a turnover boom from the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends celebrating the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas one, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that re-invite their employees and a sense that the volume of the groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that, as a whole, the reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Of course, the illusion of festivities has not gone down, pay who pays, it indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises concern in U.S.
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at “a faster rate than any other country.”
WikiLeaks leaks confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the WikiLeaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Aside from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of U.S. diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the area of atomic security, rather than going up, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for unveiling in Washington.
Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Advisor, James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep watch.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The latest in the documentation leaked by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan’s high pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," said: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also called on Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups".
In Search of the WikiLeaks Boss
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism officer to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks’ lawyer Mark Stephens said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
It was on the 20th that the international police body based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Interpol’s 188 countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “in view of his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization, do consider the so-called notice network a freeway to proceed with arrest -- which must be undertaken by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder has shown willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities by videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, which they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
“This seems like a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter reads.
As the world searches for him – and from Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange remains in unknown but not silent location.
On Monday, he granted an indefinite interview to Time magazine’s director via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the U.N. in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridden and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorism fighter, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to undermine Assange contrasts with views that are now proclaimed conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the Homeland Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone who gives them any contribution or aid.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has had to back down after saying Assange should be “killed.”
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something.”
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with whistles to Carod's relatives
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to bypass the ninth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation is insufficient for those related to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can at all cause the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to win over the new critics with winks that will allow him to arm himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to speak out about their continuity in secret.
By papers, not by lifting hands.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said he would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand from the president something more than putting his office at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But as they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree a roadmap with the executive by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the national council for a vote on 18.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something that the summit already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” undermines stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty door cloths inward.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the acting adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the head of Innovation said that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various goals".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assemblyism as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by vote.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish system of parties, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave of 2008 left the task to the management to review assemblage at a specific statute reform congress.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years advised against addressing the issue.
Now, with no critical sectors at bay, it may be a good time to take it back and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico count, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the contents of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the one of three women and the discovery of a pair of bodies enclosed in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there are 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases stands out the one of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearms and the grace shot in the head in addition to his feet and hands tied with wire.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the chest of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
In the early hours of Thursday four, ejidataries found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway, in the stretch that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was found a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman was killed by eight gunshots after leaving his home to begin garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were shot in the head each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, in the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot in the forehead was found the body of a man on a solitary road from the El Naranjo Colony and under the body they found a hood struck with a 25 caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the blackwater channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency corpses carried out an exhaustive search of the other members of the body, however, they were not located.
Neighbors in Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse that was in the Peña Colorada area, which was tied with his hands backwards and with his head tied.
The man had a gunshot wound to his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the chest of a vehicle in the streets of the fractionation Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizapán of Zaragoza, was reported, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony he was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of his body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Ríos according to a message that he sent from his executioners.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunfire in the neck, the dead body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
In the skin of the woman, tattoos of the Holy Death were detected, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet hits and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a pair of men with their heads belted and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message supposedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who don't align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied feet and hands, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the colony of St. Augustine.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while, the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag on the streets of the Colonia Juárez.
Alongside him, the officers found a card with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The country’s representative at COP16 said its country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and said it maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of that country at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He noted that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four headings: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and pilot program support.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year’s approval of a new Energy Act, which sets out the targets for reducing emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve energy saving, energy efficient use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, several multiannual plans, funded by the Chinese government as well as by governments of other countries, are in progress or have already been completed.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficient Use Program, which was implemented over the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent spotlights to savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and expects to do more by 2020.
Attached to legality expulsion of Espino: Cesar Nava
The national leader of the NAP explained that the former panista leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former panista leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what suits his right.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal, if any, to the Commission of Order of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that there has never been an alliance at the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will come out strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which he will have to elect his successor.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal," he said.
The breadmaker said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; to the counter "we enjoy it and strengthen us", he said.
He said that the council will undoubtedly be able to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence delivering the scam "to whomever the council determines."
"I have that absolute peace and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the party's rebound in the last July 4 election will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now, it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a subject of observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about the criticism of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his speech during the four years of his government, César Nava called on the priests to reflect on the sexenniums of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; let them start defending them; let them get out of the closet,” he said.
He felt that the head of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no bite or much less censorship.
Obama on Twitter promotes law in favor of undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link with a broader document calling on the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that the legislation’s vote is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he said.
The message came after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding are approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think it's been a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a “debate shutdown vote” for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, so they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, at a time when project-supporting organizations are leading an intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
For this reason, supporters of the Dream Act require the addition of several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they will not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the wound
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where the participants made the narrative gala.
"That of The sex in the tongue I understand it, but... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the tongue, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of his question (at another fair he explained the round table).
The finger in the sore... "puts us in trouble," the Argentine writer gently kicked the audience, mostly young people, who made an appointment at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Garro and Luis Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "scourge" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist comes the conviction: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who clarifies that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and the traps of the tongue must go very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative titled Elogio de la invención, where the finger in the wound is not named but at some point discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, the account of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that had lost a maiden, narration that turned to talk later America, the great novel that was not missing from the beginning the conquered by its own chroniclers who conquered the D.
“Cervantes who invented us all made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with the imagination that was lacking even in modesty.”
However, he highlighted "it is the madmen and the embusters who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that the narrative belongs to one side or the other, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
In fact, it is called the “Cervantine tradition.”
“By his inheritance we are what is counted.”
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero nodded and applauded the variety of interpretations that resulted in the FIL’s invitation with her round table The Finger in the Wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers towards the great scourge of social violence that crosses her country - and shares Latin America - a product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of conscience that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes".
“To be owners of our thought and owners of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times putting our finger on the wound and annoying those people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also annoying the powers that prefer a world in black and white sense,” he said.
Romeo won his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who meet each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone in white and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian has ended up comforting himself with the medal of the vice-champion, has been one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he fell by a 4-2 global against Toluca; subsequently, in the Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 global and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team ended up tied 2-2 against the crooks after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he put himself in front by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally 4 players his pass.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same fate, he seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any stats, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing," the steward said when he was questioned about the numbers he has against playing in the finals.
Very current has the previous final, of which, he assures, has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were already prepared to go running and I think that's a lesson until the end."
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalties shots, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we did not have a bad game in the end or sometimes the fate
Romano has in his hands to stop being a technician sub-champion and test for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules for obtaining visas
Individuals will need to go to Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be lower as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa will change at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will need to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) before their interview at the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another more for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for cases of visas on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for merchants and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their footprints.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will stay at the ASC for less time than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency cited the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery Thursday that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 13:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present “a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” prompting speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures besides us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way of survival and this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that “yes, there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know.”
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at tomorrow’s press conference Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesture PRD, PT, Convergence and opposition 'block' pattern
With reforms to the Congressional Organic Law, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartidism', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of ‘bipartidism’ in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'throned' against the reform to the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts ‘bipartidism’, because now there will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by baker Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo, explained that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be crushed again by both parties and with that ended the opposition coalition.
“So far it has come (the opposition coalition), it’s what I look at, because we’re excluded, from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress after having been monopolistic, now be "duopolitic".
“It is not the spirit of reform to the law that there is eternal bipathy in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 lawmakers, and they are talking to other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress has become a 'booty' between two, in reference to the PAN and PRI.
"It used to be just one game, now they're splitting it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by cupola agreements, let's leave out 5 that we're probably going to make 9 deputies, now the five who see us, separated into different factions, we have decided to unite to look for a place at the negotiating table, that's the issue that in the reform they made that they agreed, we're out and we don't agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatlan pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
A cheque for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the company of electrical material, amounts to 1 million 200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200,000 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to be paid".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit Office of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, consequently, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, you’re just being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last of November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Gazette of the State, as indicated by the Law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not reused their services.
The above, after that on July 25, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the peso of 42 million euros to the City Council, plus 10 million euros to the City Council.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to attend tourist sites
Tourist businessmen regret the accident of the foreign tourist for the bad conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced the care of the image of the destination and reverse the bad that tourists encounter with new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and get back to nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a company one day and they have no idea how much money is lost, or else they wouldn’t have done the work in such a long time and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it by giving preventive maintenance and not fall solely in the corrective," he said.
“We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area should be maintained, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well.”
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and Venadito of Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"There has not been proper attention and this kind of facts highlight something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that should be put in line together with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote to the destination."
Requests IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies take the great responsibility of being an example of looking for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A dignified and agreement-free Labour Legislature between parties and the State Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which totals a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that do not repeat the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly inaugurated 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of looking for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to safeguard their own interests and become carnival companions of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
Hence, he talked about certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that bring forward the Governor in turn.
“We take care that they come to do a work worthy and above all committed to society and to the sectors because it was the Sinaloes who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation.”
As for the tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he has in the state budget to strengthen the State Secretary of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the second secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is inconsistent as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition, it is required to label resources to detonating tourism projects and that help to give security to the state and update to the Alcohols Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
If you are looking for a magical king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the cravings of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next King’s Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so much desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Salvador Allende Colony and live on the day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"We see it hard sometimes because my husband doesn't have a bell, but we sell mandarin and papa ... in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a monster car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests sized clothes for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said to him 'let's go see son', because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado family Valenzuela can participate in the campaign Seek a Wizard King, donating a toy or cash at the reception of the Northwest.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out as part of the dismantling of a network of cannabis production and sale.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and production equipment have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at Sherbrooke’s courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of smuggling, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come after a long investigation that has lasted for nearly a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the detentions," Mr. Ruel said.
About 70 officers from the Estrie Security Quebec Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Is it possible to fight illegal migration without problems?
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of illegal migrants’ fatherlands, will surely face a huge opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I'm mainly based on the Charter."
"I'm here with a party that has created the granite you're trampling on," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow for up to a year to detain anyone coming from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
“We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does,” Duceppe said.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has slammed criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of the clandestine fathers and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians are telling MPs that they don’t tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country like it’s a scam.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative told QMI that the government would request a vote so that each MP who opposes would later be explained to their constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest had been announced, numerous observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea was not raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation in New York this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Accordingly, Tuesday's announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services of Quebec on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for Quebec party critic Stéphane Bergeron, who deals with the issue of public security, to describe this announcement as “a rabbit pulled out of the crab” and “a last-minute crappy solution.”
The Dutil Minister, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” it simply indicates.
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ president Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest persists in avoiding the creation of this committee of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the intervener-general to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the intervener-general," he concludes.
It also believes that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus forcing people to testify.
The creation of a permanent gang is not the only project at stake in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to have come from the prosecutor for Operation Marteau, who has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in connection with this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001 related to motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed for the adoption of the Gangster Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, the houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters are also expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, several rivers are feared to overflow.
On Wednesday night, Quebec’s Civil Security unit issued warnings for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers of Saint-Jérôme, Laurentides, and Chêne, Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Crowd Forecast Center, for its part, issued announcements Wednesday communicating the strong Crowds of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assumption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partly blamed on Dupont.
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) over controversial statements regarding social assistance and about Haitians, as well as their rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who committed suicide, do not infringe the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision came after a complaint from the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were incorrect.
Presenters should provide reliable and not misleading data.
In connection with the suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had stated that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life ' s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of Dupont le midi have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Any blame has therefore been dismissed in this regard.
The last litigation concerned statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already fulfilled my three-day suspension up there."
"My record has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the broadcast of rude language.
In any case, the radio station CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of the largest audience within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and Thai boxing, climbs to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance the professional level.
“In my case, I look for combat everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy playing on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the Amateur World Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won in the kickboxing full contact and thai boxing categories,” he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
“In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009.”
“The interesting thing is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
"At this step, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as to throw opponents to the ground.
Clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, on a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only maintain a competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
“It has been an incredible experience.”
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“He who has won me is a true professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face each other in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category compete to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the center of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition.”
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now openly do it," Quebec MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can benefit in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there has been a collusion with this contract.
“I’m starting to get tired,” he protested, defending that the PQ had acted “dishonestly” and “with a lack of rigor.”
He noted that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
Typically, this is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
Work has already begun and will continue until 2012.
In any case, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortia in the technical advisory sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick look at Quebec’s trade register identifies more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, i.e. Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labor dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher.”
“You have two options: you can contact the players in the sector and tell them: we’re going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price.”
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the people's competition," Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has implied that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also tied to these companies, which “finance” it, before specifying that it is rather their leaders.
The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More eco-friendly, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer barely trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption flow, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows down his commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates that carry the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that bear labels indicating that they are "co-responsible", notes the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the speeches of politicians on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, which is currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the dubious nature of information cause 46% of consumers to discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers say they also distrust the supposed yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, nearly half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood’s shops and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer notes.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a maximum of 100 this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to take the position of the king of recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be of doors (of their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after Société Angus and the Parallele, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallele, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to repurchase Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return him his true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would, in fact, be lower than initial expectations; this could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a 12.8 million application last spring, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, submitted a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation must be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not fund real estate projects, as it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector are demanding considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has for ten years carried the charge of the author's cinema in his premises of the complex, after funding its own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to keep its customers loyal.
The company Angus and the Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallele, continues to screen films on eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, screening Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers the Canadians’ complex with respect to the Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter’s sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, i.e. during the full federal election campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not get into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority practically inherent in Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Accordingly, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"The ability of a candidate, a party, and even more so, a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will register a deficit for the first time in the last decade due to a $30,000 to $40 billion recovery plan,” Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image conveyed by the dramatic series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which make little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the abductions for the CIA to carry out energetic interrogations.
Another cable reports that during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but it depended on "each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in connection with Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the mood has been warmed up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by an amount that corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GEI on the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of global car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, another 5 Gt of this amount should be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees centigrade to prevent it from being out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced by twice.
Fluo-compact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above all, they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have expressed reservations about fluorescent bulbs, since they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers give instructions.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluorescent bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the benefits that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"Please ask all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the election commission has allowed Wednesday's deadline to pass at midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had told television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the world has multiplied demands that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo's side counts on the Constitutional Council's annulment of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the old New Forces (FN) rebellion since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, campaign director for the president of Côte d’Ivoire, said the intimidation maneuvers carried out by the UN in the north of the country had deterred followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo’s complaints.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider the country's highest court not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have set the stage for the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on continental territory (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the active population in continental territory and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has registered an increase of 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but wish to work, whether or not available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they seek employment.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in a year), 25% including DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older people, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months and in one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with DOMs.
Unemployment was only stable among people aged between 25 and 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in a year) and 8.8% across France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking of influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, but it's something else to prove," her lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their closest people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done is take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to lawyer Simon.
As part of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is also being investigated since Wednesday for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The instructor judge has taken the explanations into account and released him," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said.
On Tuesday night, four other people were interrogated and released under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been charged with “trafficking influences and passive corruption”.
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "subtracting and misappropriating public goods by a person dedicated to the public service" and "compliance in the misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “covering up social property abuse.”
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently incarcerated in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect their societies have served to whitewash the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research notes that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator detained in Iran for "espionage", has haunted the public in France, has alerted to diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée has explained its strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice on how to manage their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of walkers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by U.S. justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram drawn up on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled “Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases”.
The Elysée’s advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
It explains the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held forcibly in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release.”
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often.”
Because, once attempts to negotiate by discrete channels are exhausted, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “experts in dilatory maneuvers.”
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a common Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
It announces that Clotilde Reiss’ release from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she will take refuge in the French embassy) “will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money” (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he notes that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could “in the near future detain another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge’s decision.
The U.S. embassy, like numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iran’s clandestine nuclear procurement networks, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Freeing the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that it was not so.
The Elysée, he says, has not only “been greatly surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot override the judicial decision," he said.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée counselor dials a phone number, hangs it, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée did not spare in efforts, using statements and organized “fuges” in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential” role of “mediator.”
Americans observe this activity with some irony and find that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles convey the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media blitz of French officials".
What is the reason for such “gratitude” towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their laudable statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
Then the document discusses the reasons that have led the Elysée to give way to this fiction.
The great communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of openness towards Syria,” he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been stained with premature and undeserved".
In exaggerating Syria’s role, Paris tries to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confides in him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done something or not."
"But anyway, we thanked him."
"At least this should cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an “active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.”
Starting at midnight, young Koreans can’t play online
The South Korean government is going to pass a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teens from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gambling companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministerial responsible for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the parents of the young people so request, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appoints organising countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday appointed the organising countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come to the forefront over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions behind the scenes, therefore, may last until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) nominations have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the fire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have launched intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the successful blow given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had secured in 2005 for London the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain the brilliance of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the duo Spain-Portugal also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World Cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial outlook of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, the only thing they get is to give points to Russia, which has become an outsider of weight despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced “unfair competition in the preparation of the vote,” in a direct allusion to the English press’ accusations against EC members.
“They’re pulling out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favourites.
As the world’s first economic powerhouse and home to FIFA’s top sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for the two countries that jointly organized the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in the Elysée leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it is always necessary to appear to be doubtful.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, even if they didn’t believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed he didn’t rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he is dealing with the MPs of the UMP, on Tuesday night at the Elysée, the possibility of "two terms" has provoked some stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
I was just passing on the facts, not an announcement.
It’s not the first time he’s talked about presidential elections, with a joking tone, in meetings like this.
"In the worst, or better, case, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not wondering what's to come next."
His earlier statements do not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor any less.
They raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather, the fact that his 2012 candidacy is evident is what leads many PS people to demand that the battle be organized earlier than expected.
On the other hand, bad surveys.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and at the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and prudently.
“If he thinks he can lose, he won’t be a candidate,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He will always think he can win,” corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The latest meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to clarify the ways out of the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end by the end of the year.
Due to the crisis of European sovereign debt, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a situation more than complicated today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde backed the ECB’s active role in resolving the debt crisis in European states.
It did not mean that it considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program to buy government bonds.
"I reserve my opinion to my fellow Europeans."
On the eve of his hearing in Brussels before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer eloquent in his intentions, indicating only that the programme for the purchase of State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" during the meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, he would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is little doubt that they will follow the purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant change of course.
Although more than three-month loan operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I don't think it's going to change your program considerably."
“If not, it would run the risk of triggering new tensions in the short term,” says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 will occur," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
Regarding interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds so that the market remains stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked increase in returns paid by the most fragile states," a major bond manager said.
Because, if interest rates are set by the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi capes the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, regional presidents have said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference from long-term German rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of hedging against bankruptcy risk (CRQ) contracts had risen to 263 points, causing a certain upheaval in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "turbulence in markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, their problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the state to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecasts have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget that is being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will need to be adopted," said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2 percent of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries," said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening the mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde said: “I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone.”
Although it was relative, yesterday’s relaxation in the rates of European states’ obligations has boosted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
Standard & Poor’s said it could lower Portugal’s debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
“As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs heavily on banking systems,” the economists at Exane BNP Paribas said.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Aware of this gap and the dangers it conceals, European countries are intensifying debates to reinforce existing mechanisms to get out of the crisis.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this is also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issue of EFSI bonds is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are added to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
They both want to avoid at all costs seeking international aid before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider necessary to sustainably increase confidence.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of public bond markets.
By way of Paris on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to pull out the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be enough, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, currently endowed with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A piece of advice that could undoubtedly be examined in detail in the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions are worsening.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and may affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already in orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects northern Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the Isle of France.
Snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Isle of France and Lemosin.
The snowfall is strong enough to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons has been prohibited, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, the traffic in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it is not driven except in case of necessity and the circulation of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
On Thursday, school transport in Picardy was banned.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "exhorts all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to the planned snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers get in touch with their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
The Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the Isle of France has reached its peak, billions have been raining.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris subway to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State has announced a funding allocation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
In theory, this amount will be the one that will subsequently allow SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending Finance Act, reviewed by the National Assembly’s finance committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices in the Isle of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and dedicate such an increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from 4 billion.
"It is necessary that the tax resources are added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the statement reads.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the $4 billion later, as we explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The SGP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised $4 billion is not included in the credit, can provoke a slightly energetic parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it unveils an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let’s go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of public knowledge news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for novelties about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know what, the editor of Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same information that Newsweek published the previous week.
Then why have the revelations of these records caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of State can be called on the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into espionage centers.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows it perfectly, only we pretend we don’t know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secrets of the most powerful country in the world greatly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "verdugos".
But let’s get into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, he could conceive of himself as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power can escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circulating.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the citizen’s avenger) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets stand?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without a secret, since it comes from the public domain; but unveiling, as WikiLeaks has done, all the secrets of Hillary Clinton will mean.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any confidential information on the network, since it would be like posting it on a street sign.
But it’s also clear that, with current technologies, you can’t expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and, therefore, novel, but I imagine government agents discreetly moving in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: ultimately, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with cables (phones).
The videotapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, advancing and backwards, uncovering all the secrets of editing, while now the CDs (digital) only allow them to move forward or backwards from chapter to chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the journeys it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was being secretly plotted in the embassies.
Today, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's plunder in its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked financing promises (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been met.
And the French chapuzas have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its member states, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparency was appreciated for what it really is: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track towards meeting its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken the year 2009 as a reference: international financing is maintained and 150 million are added over three years in terms of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
France, on the other hand, considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while purporting to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that every euro borrowed equals one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as the equivalent of a euro that is donated... At the very least, only the cost of the loan should be calculated for its commitments, the equivalent type of loan to the country that lends.
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it for yourself.
It is the only country in the EU that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments to 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfill its commitment, France contributes only ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France commits a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions over time and, on the other hand, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he is spending 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The chapter on early funding is a minutiae, relatively short-term, in relation to the whole of the climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of meeting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could move the debate on stakes at stake in relation to long-term financing forward (another essential chapter that is currently being debated): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of the “additional character” and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a ten-year-old child usually consumes in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, which adhere to official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as the treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The plate balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“While, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each chemical individually are not exceeded, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrying,” the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a school snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, including in food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian fillet, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were sticky with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most “nutritious” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these “contaminant cocktails” to the consumer is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in view of the gravity of the situation" to implement a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
