Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will “look like fools”
Some members of the National Assembly were frightened by a proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was made in connection with plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties fear that this could bring ridicule.
One of the Labour MPs said his party was concerned that "the shortcut is rhymed with the words twp and pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, “twp” means dumb and “pwp” means cock.
A member of the Welsh party said the party as a whole was "dissatisfied" and was proposing alternatives.
The Conservative Party MP said that his party is approaching the change of name "liberal", but noted that the MWP is not far from the abbreviation "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u".
The Commission is currently working on the bill that will change the names of the Assembly, which stated: "The final decision on the possible designation of members of the Assembly will, of course, be the responsibility of the Members themselves."
The Wales Administration Act of 2017 granted the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the debate on the proposals with the public. The results showed that the change of the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament has broad support.
With regard to the designation of members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Wales Parliamentary Members’ (WMPs), but the MWP was given the most support in the debate with the public.
Obviously, MEPs are trying to propose alternative options, but the problem may be to reach an agreement, in particular for President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform laws will also include further changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on the exclusion of Members and a proposal for a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on their designation when discussing the laws.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country’s name should be changed to “North Macedonia”.
A popular vote was declared in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that its northern neighbor’s name expresses a claim to Greek territory, and has therefore repeatedly objected to the country’s requests for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President <0xC4><0x90>orge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price the country has to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church have been silenced as a result of the problems of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I’ve been talking to claim that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams says.
“Not one or the other today.”
In his opinion, the loss of bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently nowadays,” he says.
“A bar is no longer a living room where people from around the world meet regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later they will be back to the beginning.”
As he added, the churches could be printed with rented houses, with the residential areas filled by people who will not support the remaining temples nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will form whites,” he says. “The day will come when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of the people coming to these neighborhoods will be whites.”
Both churches built the White Congregation before Harlem became the metropolis of the Black population. The Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original White Congregation of Methodists moved in the 1930s.
The claim to the building was made by the Black Congregation, which performed worship nearby.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by the Black Congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, a central figure in the boycott of retailers on 125th Street (Harlem's most prominent shopping street) who refused to hire and support black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners had the church rebuilt as part of plans to rebuild the bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called this bell ringing "the bells of the poor."
The specialist, who played the bell in July, called it a “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
This specialist is Tiffany Ngo from the University of Michigan, who also noted that it was the world’s first bell to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who began playing the larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says no one in St. Martin's Church replaced him.
Over the last few months, a complex story of architects and suppliers has taken place in the Church of St. Martin. Some were brought by world leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
A Faroese report, made up of world leaders and running the parish, the diocese wrote in July that it feared that the diocese would "leave the costs" to the Faroese government, despite the fact that the Faroese government did not take part in hiring architects and contractors who had been sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency in the conduct of the diocese.
13-year-old boy who hunted lobster in California hurts shark
According to authorities, on Saturday, he attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy's shark. The boy was hunting lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel for the KSWB-TV station in San Diego said he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help. He then sailed with the group to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was thrilled that he had caught the lobster, but then “he found the boy screaming, ‘Something bit me!
“Something bit me!”
He had a completely torn key bone," said Hammel, who was the first to notice when he approached the boy.
“I urged everyone to get out of the water: ‘The water is a shark!’” added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is not known.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not found to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's area in Encinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to invest in UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to create lanes with cosmetics in the style of retail houses and thus compete with the chains Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams. Specialized assistants will be available.
This is a significant investment of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the UK cosmetics market, which is steadily growing, while sales in the fashion and household needs sectors are falling. As part of the investment, the larger avenues with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the UK.
The investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on the shelves that once belonged to televisions, microwaves, and household necessities.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double their cosmetics range to 3,000 products, with for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw being available.
The current product lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space, because there will be seats reserved for brands similar to, for example, in Boots stores.
In addition, Supermarket is once again launching its Boutique makeup line to make most of its products available for vegans, as young customers are increasingly demanding it.
The fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will also test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores. The first store was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open by the end of the year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the trend of buying small amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores with a variety of goods means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that sales will increasingly resemble retail houses. His supermarket chain is trying to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl in a way that offers more services and different than food.
Sainsbury's incorporated Argos into hundreds of stores and also integrated several Habitat stores. Both chains bought the company two years ago. According to its representatives, this step increased food sales, making acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to innovate departments with cosmetics and medicines failed.
After 2000, Sainsbury's tested jointly with the Boots chain, but the merger ended a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from pharmacies in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio three years ago. This company owns the LloydsPharmacy chain and the sales value was <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
The company said that the Lloyds chain will play an important role as a broader range of premium skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, will be added in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and style of the cosmetic street to make our customers shop in a more pleasant environment.
In addition, we have invested in the special training of colleagues who will be message and ready to help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all requirements. An impressive environment and practical locations mean that we have become a major destination in the field of cosmetics, which is an innovation of traditional shopping."
Peter Jones 'infuriated' that Holly Willoughby terminated <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
Dragons' Day star Peter Jones is "infuriated" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has cancelled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with his lifestyle product brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of interior accessories and Truly accessories.
The company of this pair was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning moderator (37) announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby angered the star of the Dragons' Day show, Peter Jones, because at the last minute she was taking advantage of a lucrative joint trade with the lifestyle brand to focus on her own new mega deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when a golden girl on television during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that the new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant he would no longer have enough time to get to know the trustees to deal with them.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of the UK and headed for one of his vacation homes.
One source said: “The Truly project was clearly Holly’s number one priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, and it was supposed to secure her for several decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all those involved was absolutely shocking.
On Tuesday, no one understood what was going on. The launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods at the Marlowe Headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the This Morning, which belongs to the most ludicrous stars of the UK, can cost the company millions. The reason is huge investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and apartment accessories to the market, but also mentioned the possibility of
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Cappo for ten years.
Willoughby designed the Truly with Capp project in 2016 and Jones (52) became director in March.
The couple are on vacation, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S’ ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin, who hosts I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on business matters.”
It was a tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism that the media expects of him for his remarks. Some will consider her “unworthy of the president” and blame him for saying so positively about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump sacrificed so much?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “moderator” voice.
“I didn’t sacrifice anything at all.”
He noted that after the initial joint meeting in June in Singapore, Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump celebrated the first meeting as a big step on the way to the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have been suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Jong-ho, the world leader at the UN General Assembly, said on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "proportionate response" by the United States to North Korea's first steps towards disarmament.
He noted that instead, the US continues to impose sanctions in order to increase pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech before the meeting.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results — an end to missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remaining U.S. troops to their homes.
He also defended the unusual way he talks about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to talk like a president, but then there wouldn’t be 10,000 people out there trying to get in, instead there would be 200 people out there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquake in Indonesia devastated one of the islands and killed hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs learned that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to leave their homes, a nationwide disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international aid, so it is a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo Purwo Nugro, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to participate in relief work.
Given the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly facing, the country’s readiness for nature’s anger is sad.
Although shelters are built in Aceh from the tsunami, they are not common on other coasts.
The large number of casualties probably contributed to the apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite the fact that there was an active warning.
Even under favorable conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is complicated.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was on Lombok to provide care for the victims of the earthquake is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo built his election campaign to improve Indonesia’s rampant infrastructure, spending his savings on roads and railways.
However, Widod’s administration is troubled by a lack of finances, with elections awaiting him again next year.
In addition, Widodo faces pressure for ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, as the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
During the fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands more had to leave their homes. The gangs used machetes, bows and arrows and other raw weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of FC Liverpool faces Chelsea from a distance
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League. He scored in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a touchdown from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea's gate. His team lost 1:0 at the time.
He threw the ball to the left and fired a shot at the farthest hedge.
His attempt flew high above the penalty area and pointed towards the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball finally fell through the impending Kep Arrizabalag into the net.
“I was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to play as much forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I made one touch. I didn't think much about it and I fired."
Chelsea led after a 1:0 half-time, followed by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward gave Mate Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> a pass before the goal, turned in the middle of the field and sprinted to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> introduced a quick hit in the middle of the field.
Then he sent out a beautiful introspection, which he and Hazard were heading to the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and ended up at the farther pole when he overtook Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker with a left-handed shot.
Liverpool awaits a match against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League. The match starts on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday from 3:00 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people were trapped in the debris of buildings that destroyed an earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugro said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has filled the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman who was stabbed to death
This morning, an investigation into the murder began after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are urging people in the area who have seen or heard something to come and tell.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I call on everyone who was located near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded anything using the on-board camera, to contact us because they may have key information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene of the crime. They wanted to find out where she was found in the morning.
Investigations are underway and police said they are currently informing the victim’s family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but police have notified him that no one is allowed into or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to say anything.
The owners of the apartments are currently learning that they will get back inside in a few hours.
One of the officers heard another man telling him that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A weeping woman appeared on the spot.
He keeps saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, another van was out.
There were several police officers in the cordon watching the panel house.
Police are asking anyone with information to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 with reference to Protocol 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in front of parliament is the latest monument to the controversy over the "rewriting of history"
Its removal would be a satisfaction for his fanatical Puritan supporters such as the Taliban to have destroyed so many English cultural and religious artifacts.
Cromwell's company, however, called Crick's proposal "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current discussion about the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of Westminster Palace would become one of the targets.
Cromwell neither ordered nor executed the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps he would have been sacrificed by the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell’s grand realization by Sir William Ham Thornycroft testifies to his perception in the 19th century and is part of the history of a personality that, according to many, still deserves respect.”
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many – perhaps at the end of the 19th century there were more of them than today – to be the protector of Parliament from outside forces, in his case of course the protector of the monarchy.
As to whether this is a completely accurate description of the facts, historians continue to lead the debate.
But the truth is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique figure who embodies one side of this dispute.
The successes he has achieved as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and respect.”
Pig slays a Chinese farmer to death <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
According to local media reports, in a market in southeast China, a farmer attacked and killed pigs.
The man, who is known only by the name of Jüan, was found dead with an interrupted artery and bloodshed near a market in Liou-pchan-shui prefecture in the province of Kuej-cho, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares a measles vaccine on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning Prefecture in Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, he reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door of the next barn open.
He said there was a large male pig in the barn with a bloody papule.
According to the report, the court investigation confirmed that this 250-kilogram muzzle crushed the farmer to death.
“The brother had bloody and shattered legs,” said a cousin named Wu, who was quoted as saying by the Guiyang Evening News.
According to the security cameras, Jüan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager for the Evening News said the pig had been separated so as not to attack anyone else, while police on the spot were gathering evidence.
Jüan's family and market representatives are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although pig attacks on humans are rare, they have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pushed a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife was able to scare off the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
Chantia, they're curious... they don't intend to hurt anyone.
They just need to show proper respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to many places in the southwestern United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening, moving above the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, the rose will bring tidal rains in northern Mexico and southwestern the United States.
Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h at 5:00 East American time on Sunday, which is a category 1 hurricane. It was located 620 kilometers southwest of the Mexican outskirts of Punta Eugenia.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Over the Pacific Ocean, meanwhile, a crust has begun to form, moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push deep tropical humidity north to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 25 centimeters of rainfall to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical moisture then combined with the approaching crust will form in the coming days in the southwest a large and dense rainfall.
In some places, 2 to 10 centimeters of rainfall will fall, causing severe dangerous floods, flooding of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rain, during which the point drops 5 to 8 millimeters of precipitation per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, rainfall is expected from 5 to 10 centimeters.
Heavy flooding can occur, as conditions are rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
Given the threat of tropical rainfall, it would be extremely unreasonable to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can cause rivers to rage in the canyons, with storms locally bringing a strong wind with dust in the air.
The approaching crust in some parts of the southern California coast will cause severe local rainfall.
It can fall more than 13 millimeters of precipitation, which could cause the debris to float on a smaller scale and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainfall in the area during its rainy season.
In the late evening on Sunday and early morning on Monday, scattered rain gusts of tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona. In the late evening on Monday and on Tuesday, the rain will already be spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners states and will last until Wednesday.
Temperature fluctuations can occur throughout the U.S. in October, as the Arctic cools down while the tropical zone remains relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp changes in temperature at a short distance.
A great example of a sharp change in temperature is in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
The difference between the temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is almost 11 degrees.
Over the next few days, he will again try to transplant and expand the persistent summer heat.
In the middle and east of the United States, the warm beginning of October is expected in many places. In several territories from the Southern Plains to part of the northeast, the temperature will exceed 26 degrees.
In New York City, it could be 26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high likelihood of over-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the entire first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s interrogation was followed by more than 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the impressive statement of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault. The attack on Christine Blasey-Ford was reportedly in the 80s.
It was not until Friday that the radio and television stations interrupted the broadcast for a last-minute turnaround: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake secured a deal that would allow the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had caught her in a drunken state and tried to strip her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, who spoke passionately, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the broadcast was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that broadcast the broadcast, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring attendance in offices.
For comparison, a similar number of viewers watch a play-off game of American football or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, which has been strongly supported by the founding moderators, was followed by an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long interview, the highest of all networks.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was high even after the end of the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Flake.
After the office of this temperate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning. Protesters yelled at him as he tried to get a lift to the Judiciary Committee for questioning.
For a few minutes, he stood with his eyes closed and listened to the complaints broadcast live by CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one of the women.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
Someone said to him, “You have great power, but many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator was closed, he added that he would say more at the committee's hearing.
All cables and other networks were also engaged in live affairs hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would be forwarded to the entire Senate for a vote.
Flake, however, said he would only do so if the FBI investigates the charges against the nominee over the next week, which are urged by minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is his friend.
After interviewing Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s election had great power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes for Kavanaugh’s approval without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'frontiers of political games' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused those who criticized her intention to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is attending a meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her plan within the framework of Brexit, which is likened to the game of ladies. He said that the proposal to have the UK and the EU collect each other's customs is "completely absurd".
Waydea Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson in Relation to LSU Player Death
Police have arrested a suspect who allegedly shot dead Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials have released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The police secured the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA, which was reported by WAFB, a partner of the CBS network.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had admitted to shooting Simsa.
According to the lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The coroner's office in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local authorities involved in the criminal proceedings for “endeavouring and advancing justice”.
The Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where he played basketball for LSU and his father Wayne.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "smashed" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
"You're always afraid of that," Wade said.
Volcano shovels ash to Mexico City
The ash that rolls from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarter of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to avoid volcanoes, after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas emissions and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has recorded several times the noise and shaking.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash covering glass cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-degree earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence protesters got into conflict with the orderly police. Other thousands took part in parallel demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the Catalan unanimous vote, a rally about
A group of masked separatists were stopped by the police, throwing eggs and powder paint, and the streets, which are sometimes crowded with tourists, were filled with dark clouds of dust.
Later in the day, there were also riots, and the police used slingshots to get the fighters under control.
Over the course of several hours, a group of independence supporters who sang "don't forget, don't forgive" faced unionist protesters who shouted "long live Spain".
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum declared Madrid illegal, the region's independence struggles continue to erupt, but Catalan separatists have celebrated it.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence, but the turnout was low, as opponents of the split boycotted the vote to a large extent.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to prevent continued voting in polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped outside on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The protests continued, but they had to go in a different direction.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer believed that Catalonia would achieve independence.
“We had one of the best moments last year.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we’re trapped,” he says.
Although Catalan political parties seeking independence in the regional elections last December achieved a close (but important) victory, this year they will no longer be able to successfully continue. Many of their best-known leaders have gone out in exile themselves and are not waiting for trial in prison.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming a protest in support of the police over the phone, says politicians on both sides contributed to the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been waiting in jail for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government is showing us,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for hitting a house with a car
Three men, ages 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a Londonderry home.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
In addition, there may have been a gunshot wound to the car.
Meng's goal was Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga wins first goal for Livingston
Newcomer Livingston shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only a second loss in 18 games since joining the Ibrox coaching team.
Dolly Meng's intervention proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team reached the second Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is still out of the Premiership this season with no wins. Next Sunday will be his rival leader Hearts, behind him by eight points.
Even before that, the Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the European League on Thursday.
Livingston extended his league invincibility series to six games. Head coach Holt, who beat Kenny Miller last month, still hasn't tasted the bitterness of losing.
Livingston burns down the odds against the crooked guests
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead long before the goal. His straightforwardness made the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson penetrated, but his attempt passed before the gate. Alan Lithgow's finish then only went next door when he hit Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate with a slipper.
The homers calmly let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew that guests could cause problems from standard situations.
And that’s exactly how the decisive goal fell.
A free kick was played against the Rangers and Livingston managed to penetrate, Declan Gallagher and Robinson found Mengu after the combination and he scored from the center of the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the hold of the ball, but were unable to overcome the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was most of the time out of work.
This continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to undergo surgery.
Scott Pittman's attempt stopped Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's legs and Lithgow ended another standard Livingston situation next door.
Livingston’s sixteen-year-olds were constantly pointing at the centers, and the defense was constantly turning them away. Players demanded penalties twice – after Halkett’s surgery on alternate Glenn Middleton and after the alleged hand – but the referee allowed the game to continue.
"Fenomenal" Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
All the players as one man were exceptional. On their way up, they continue to exceed expectations.
The style of the game and the players in the team have hardly changed since returning to the top of the competition, but Holt deserves great recognition for how the team has risen since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unbelievable. He managed a perfectly organized defense, while Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall breathe out the entire match.
The Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
Under Gerrard they played very well several times, but they did not reach this level.
They missed the final touchdown – they only got home defense once – and for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, it’s a raised warning finger.
Erdogan not only received a warm welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin and the mood was excellent.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
The dispute arose because of problems related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque there.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police said a group of 25,000 people had been prevented from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but there were many supporters nearby who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents (many of them Kurds) also made themselves known, condemning Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Opposite protests show a difference of opinion about this guest. Some German Turks call him a hero, while others condemn him for autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: death of cyclist after collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeastern part of the city.
The driver stopped and ambulances arrived, but the cyclist sustained injuries on the spot.
The accident occurred just a few months after another cyclist was killed by a driver who escaped from the scene of the accident. The accident occurred on Childers Street, about 1.5 kilometers from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the police tried to identify the man and inform his relatives.
There is a closed road on the site, no bus traffic and motorists have been advised to avoid the areas.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riots
Six prison guards were wounded during riots in a men's prison with a high level of custody, according to a report by the prisoners.
The riots erupted on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time in the British Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
The Tornado Special Forces were summoned to the scene to take control of the riots, responsible for eight prisoners who managed to separate into one wing.
The guards on the spot were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison report said: “We have deployed a specially trained prison unit to resolve the ongoing incident in the UK’s Long Lartin prison.
Six employees were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in prisons and we want to make it clear that we are handing over those responsible to the police and they can stay behind the nets longer.”
In Long Lartin prison, more than 500 prisoners are serving their sentences, including the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison ended up in a hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, an additional anti-government unit was summoned to the prison to end serious riots. Prisoners then attacked the guards with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical pressure in Arizona is an exceptional phenomenon, but it is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is heading through the desert southwest, bringing with it the risk of severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning on Monday and Tuesday for the area from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with her prediction of rain in the late evening on Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones within a radius of 320 kilometers of Phoenix have had tropical storm or lower pressure status since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall, with the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona being up to 15 centimeters in some places.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 millimeters, exceptionally it can be up to 100 millimeters.
In places where there is no danger of flooding, the rain caused by the rose can be useful, as the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is of great concern, this rain is likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is currently facing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa lands on the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, which still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, is located 620 kilometers south of the Mexican outlet of Punta Eugenia and is heading north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm hit the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, thus losing its intensity.
Therefore, when it reaches the Mexican mainland on Monday afternoon or evening, it is expected to have the strength of a tropical storm.
The amount of precipitation in some parts of Mexico can be large, which means a high risk of flooding.
“A total of 75 to 150 millimetres of precipitation is expected between Baja California and the northwestern state of Sonora, and in some places it can be as high as 250 millimetres,” the weather.com reported.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north until it reaches the Arizona border in the early morning hours as a tropical pressure lower. It will then head up through Arizona and on Tuesday late evening it will reach southern Utah.
“The greatest threat to Rosa or her remains is a very large amount of rainfall in the Baja California area, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will bring life-threatening floods and flooding of debris in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton City Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three boys aged 17 to 18 and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a "stabilized" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight in the Radstock area, police said for the Avon and Somerset area.
Police are asking anyone who has recorded the incident on mobile phones to come and report the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has endured the vileness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the rejection of the reckless and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered viciousness and anger" from the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, sharply and emotionally denying the accusation that Christine Blasey-Ford had been sexually assaulted several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also spoke in connection with the indictment at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people had the opportunity to see the uniqueness, character and courage on that day” Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most respected legal experts of the day and a lawyer with a perfect history of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“There are five weeks left until the election, which is one of the most important in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m a candidate,” he said.
"I'm doing my best to support exceptional candidates."
Trump said the Democrats’ goal was to “resist and obstruct.”
The Senate’s first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to be on the agenda no later than Friday, a senior trustee of the Republican leadership told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cost hundreds of lives, death toll rises
At least 384 people died and many were taken away by waves when huge waves of earthquakes and tsunamis hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit the beaches, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the city of Palu when in the afternoon waves of up to six meters high hit the coast. The waves destroyed everything that stood in their way, and many people came and life.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the threat of a tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach. They did not flee immediately and became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugro, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency (BNP), told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself. It took cars, beams, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h on the open sea before hitting the coast.
In an attempt to escape from the tsunami, some people climbed a tree and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs released by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, hidden and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent quakes continued in this coastal city on Saturday.
In the area, which has a population of 2.4 million, several earthquakes have been recorded.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful Friday Earthquake exceeded the energy of the atomic bomb dropped during World War II on Hiroshima about 200 times.
The agency reported that the intensity of the tsunami could have been increased by the location of the city, which is located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial houses and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings. He added that 540 were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and damage could be greater in the Donggala area, which is located 300 km along the coast north of Palu, because the area is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely paralyzed" and from Donggala "no information is available," Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its employees and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday that it did not report the tsunami in Palu, but authorities said the waves arrived at a time when a warning had already been issued.
On an amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting desperate warnings to people down the street that the tsunami is approaching.
Within minutes, a water wall hit the coast, which took buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the record.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communication with the city of Palu and its surroundings, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
Authorities said the army had begun to send cargo planes to the site from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still urgently needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only for aid aircraft and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala got safely to the city of Palu, where employees are hiding in sailing shelters created in the yard of the office, they were walking through destroyed areas, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed homes,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
When humanitarian groups took on a difficult task and began to work on post-disaster reconstruction, some of them complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to arrive in Palo.
Under Indonesian regulations, finances, stockpiles and workers from other countries can only begin to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says it's a national disaster, we can open the door to international aid, but this situation has not yet occurred."
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami took place in Palu, the families and friends of the missing persevered in the hope that their closest ones would be a miracle in the gloomy story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been bound for two days by the wreckage of her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, one of whom was Mandagi.
“Since I’ve been paragliding for a long time, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Subandono described how hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel flew around the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the contestants in Palo, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray check mark instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means that the reports were not delivered," he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 at ATM in Newport on the Levee
The robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker on Friday morning, who was supplemented by an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was emptying the ATM in this entertainment complex and was about to put in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a report.
While he was busy, another man "runs out of the back of a Brink's worker" and steals bags of money for the investment.
Witnesses reportedly spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of perpetrators involved in the incident.
If you have information regarding their identity, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West's name is changed to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creature officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
In the show, he will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "citizenial reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current artistic name, West has stated in the past that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think the word ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible means ‘you’,” West said this year as he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s me, it’s you, it’s me, it’s me.
From the word Kanye, which means “one,” only Ye was created, reflecting what is good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album is more reflective of who we are.”
He is another of the famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West’s former collaborator, also presents himself with a coupling both without a coupling and in uppercase and lowercase letters.
Mexico's president vows not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has solemnly vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that “he will never, under any circumstances, use the army to defeat the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing up to 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements began to advance throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans with monthly grants for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are causing young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence.
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said an investor and promoter of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after various entities of the U.S. government have expressed themselves to artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have a general formal strategy regarding artificial intelligence.
On the contrary, China presented its plan last year: it wants to be a leader in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Since all other countries are far beyond the U.S. and we are trying to make another breakthrough in artificial intelligence, a double-budget on UI would be a good start,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the odds that we will achieve another big success in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this week by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation+ Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading companies in the world.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on the UI system, which defeated the highest-rated American player under the name Othello, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and the CEO of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee responded to previous U.S. state-of-the-art technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would take place to help uncover future visions.
As Lee said, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state grants.
“Academic leaders are not supported by China, but by big corporations,” Lee added.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best brains from universities to work on UI for them in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help support the U.S. in the area of UI.
“I think that holders of a PhD in UI should be automatically offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese State Committee issued its Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation (NSF), and other government organizations distribute money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage partners from the industrial and academic community. The White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
At the same time, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in UI research.
On the contrary, in the US legislation, which sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, no activity has been going on for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonia's citizens voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia." This move would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor’s name represents a claim to its territory and vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments drafted a deal in June that included a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that the referendum would not be voted on, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether participation would reach the minimum 50 percent needed to keep the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of membership of the European Union and NATO through the recognition of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price worth admitting Macedonia, the country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to communities such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for a future for the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough MPs have declared that they will respect the will of the voters and decide according to the result.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said that no irregularities had occurred during the referendum by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots in a Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country, thanks to which it could join NATO and the European Union, in the Macedonian city of Strumica on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, stood in front of the parliament in Skopje and pulled the chairs in front of the tents built by opponents who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We may be a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He added that the resulting “yes” would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Survey said 30 to 43 percent of voters were going to the referendum — which is below the threshold of required participation.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of those surveyed said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, participation must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beats Brighton's defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, broke the Brighton defense and secured a 2:0 victory for Manchester City.
Aguero’s elegant goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy at first sight.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He stumbled between the three Brighton defenders and ran into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He pushed himself around one defender and then circled several others on the edge of the Brighton block.
He sent a pass to the left where the ball found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time and sent it back to Aguero, who overtook Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
“Aguera has the same foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing for about 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what it was.
We were lucky to have scored that goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who earned the Cityzens an initial advantage in the Premier League meeting.
His goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got to the ball deep in the territory of Brighton during this game.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a couple of times and led Sterling towards a distant herd.
The Cityzens striker hit the ball into the net just before it slipped into the car.
City is set to play Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German city of Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to squander his chances for the Rockies
When the Nationals dropped out of the playoffs, there were not many reasons to force themselves into the next start.
But the extremely competitive Scherzer hopes to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, though only if the consequences can still follow for the Rockies, who are ahead of one game of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division NL.
With a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies retained at least a wildcard option, but still have to confirm their first division title.
Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can still get on the pitch with the idea that with the atmosphere here in Denver and with such a crowd and an opponent, it will probably be the highest level we’ll get to this year.
Of course, I want to experience it.”
The Nationals have not yet announced the first pitcher on Sunday, but apparently they will have Scherzer pitched in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, would have thrown a bullpen on Thursday and would have thrown it on Sunday, when we usually have a rest day.
The Washington Right has a balance of 18-7 with a score of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs for 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly pointed to the situation around his Supreme Court judge candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, when he talked about the importance of Republican participation in interim elections (Midterms).
“In November, everything we have achieved will be on strike.
Five weeks remain until the most important election of our lives.
It’s a huge, huge opportunity. Even though I’m not a candidate myself, I’m actually a candidate, that’s why I’m going down the country and fighting for our great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see that terrible, really terrible radical group of Democrats. It’s happening right before our eyes.
They are determined to reclaim power by any means, viciously and maliciously.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to roll over to gain power and control. That's exactly what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, went on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
"You could have seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, ugly, evil, and lying."
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, nominated Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which met with a loud outcry from the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document slip?
Um, um, what?
No, no, no, yeah, wait — her body language was really bad — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer liberal.
They do not tolerate those who express their opinions.
When momentum activists voted in favor of my reprimand, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to be told that he is no longer welcome – and all this for expressing his opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the prosecution criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically about similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
Invited to a Labour meeting outside Nottingham on Friday, he said, “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
After most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday evening meetings of the GC were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not take that tone, and the promise of a "merciful, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged according to whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because colleagues I previously thought we shared a similar political stance suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and accept views with which I would otherwise never agree on a single market – whether on a national level or not.
Every time I speak in public – and it’s basically one thing to say – there’s a tyranny of criticism on social media, calling for appeal, giving up politics in the middle, and listening to me say I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me will only get used to being political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a heap of sexist or racist attacks on a daily basis and never hide from them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is the extent to which the level of attacks has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer the famous liberals, and with every move to express “no-confidence” or change the selection rules, the party is increasingly shrinking.
Over the past two years, a lot of people have advised me not to start too much out of the crowd, be quiet and keep up, and then I’ll be “okay.”
But I didn’t get involved in politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, provoked by the indifference of the Thatcher government, which allowed the class of my high school to literally collapse, I have tried to promote better public services for those who needed it most for a minister’s office – whether for a post or for a post.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could be confused by my political stances and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the stimulus on Friday, I would only say that when the country is sliding towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy addressing my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have does not belong to the Momentum initiative in Nottingham. It is for the inhabitants of my district, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud that I have been able to serve you and I promise you that no threats of appeal, or political calculations, are the most detrimental to me.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr gets to the top
The two late attempts may have been a bit distracting for the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a triumph in this amazingly exciting match of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
He is now at the top of the table as the only undefeated team out of ten.
Ultimately, the victory brought home a great defense, as well as a better use of chances, and coach Peter Murchie has a full right to joy.
“During the games we have undergone a lot of tests and we remain unsuccessful, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Have a hat down in front of Ayr, they're taking chances better than we are."
Thanks to Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which turned Frazier Climo, Ayr took the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to renumber and Jason Baggot scored unchanged.
Climo pulled the lead of Ayr with a penalty and then, precisely in the half-time, scored a solo attempt, thanks to which Ayr could go on a break with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, changed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then followed a lengthy delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was discontinued, and as soon as the game began to continue, Ayr went on to lead the attempts of Stafford McDowall, who transformed Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and Melrose used it as an unchanged attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the meeting under heavy pressure.
However, the home side came to life again and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Clima without the ball, MacPherson achieved a touch-down from the criminal shooting with the approaching Ayr horde behind his back.
The climate changed, similar to almost at the start of the action, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing away at the fifth home run.
The star of the Still Game series is set to embark on a new career in gastronomy
The star of the British series Still Game, Ford Kieran, is apparently starting a career in services. According to our information, he was appointed as the director of the company with a license to operate a restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays in with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning a life outside of the Glasgow suburb of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source for Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in a "flowing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, cut off from the sea, makes hope of restoring access to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are besieging the naval command in La Paz, dressed in sails.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with the motto: “The sea is our right.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
In all of Bolivia, cut off from the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to re-engulf the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
After five years of deliberations, Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, which will be held on the first day of this year.
“Bolivia is on the rise, has a spirit of unity and balance and of course believes in a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the decision of the international court on large screens across the country in the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia that, after decades of interrupted negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate the granting of sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who will take part in next year’s controversial fight for re-election, also has something to say about Monday’s decision.
“Our return to the Pacific Ocean is within reach,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia – and if it did, not much would have changed.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the international court’s ruling comes only six months after hearing the final arguments suggests that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And while there can be no doubt about the Bolivian arguments, it is possible that in recent years it has taken a step backwards.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government," Zárate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric undermined all of Chile’s remaining affiliation, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will one day continue negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain dialogue.
The two countries have not had an embassy since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would be unusually quick.
Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of miscarriage and achieve mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – would use the maritime question as a political barrel.
“Pain will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea Rejects Nuclear Disarmament Until It Can Be Trusted by U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not get rid of nuclear weapons first unless it can be trusted by Washington.
Ri made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic talks on the nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it is an illusion to think that U.S. sanctions and protests against a declaration that would end the Korean War could bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant steps towards disarmament first.
Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows List the Latest Trends in Impressive Headwear That You Will Soon Find In Your Shop
If you want to expand your collection of hats or perfectly protect yourself from the sun, you no longer have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of unusual oversized head coverings at the Paris Fashion Week in their Spring/Year 19 collection at the pier.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this year and these designers sent their shocking creations to the show pier.
A unique piece from Valentina was a voluminous beige hat decorated with a papyrus roof that covered the heads of models.
Other oversized supplements included a melon laid out with gemstones, a magic hat and even pineapple – but they’re not meant to warm you up.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation was reminiscent of diving gear, even with a snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a squid with melted ice cream.
And if you like bold fashion statements – you’re in luck.
Style experts predict that huge hats will also get into the regular shops in your area.
Oversized hats follow the inspiration of “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a 60-centimeter-wide roof that everyone wore, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat that lay around every corner of social media sent another big creation to the pier – a straw beach bag almost the size of a model wearing a swimsuit.
A raffle bag of burnt orange, framed by raffle straps and complemented by a white leather ear, was a unique piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 19 collection from the Jacquemus brand at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to come to regular stores next summer – since the designer had such a huge impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized supplements.”
John Edward: Without language skills, a global citizen will not be able to
Scottish independent schools maintain excellent academic results and this trend continues in 2018 with another year of exceptional test results, further strengthening individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further and higher education, a career according to their ideas and a place in the world as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement school curriculums tailored to its needs, we still perceive modern languages as a popular and sought-after subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “When you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you speak to his heart.”
It’s a strong reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we can’t just rely on English.
From this year’s test results, we can see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest marks among independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved the highest grade A in Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as the basic skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as subjects of choice in independent and other schools as equally important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 UK Commission on Employment and Skills survey found that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited as problems with job vacancies were insufficient language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising job opportunities are emerging that languages require, these skills become essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he or she is learning a second language, he or she will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent did not know how to speak any foreign language enough to be able to speak fluently, with French being the only language in which a large percentage of people (15 percent) got doubled.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developed economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different depending on what languages it teaches.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in terms of the future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, in independent schools, he will always be able to choose from a variety of languages and will be taught by experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages remain essential to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be called “international communication abilities.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellent quality to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is set to make his debut in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first game for the Los Angeles Lakers are already waiting.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has tweeted that James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James commented on his plans for the Lakers' six-match schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I no longer need to start the preparatory matches,” he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of pre-election meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s planned meetings next week, including stops at related locations, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After abstaining from voting for his candidate for a vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming interim elections (Midterms) as Republicans face a loss of control when voting in November.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia today and where can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at 19:00 Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online below, via live stream on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will address the current hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with sexual harassment, with the Senate’s expected confirmation vote postponed for a week before the FBI race.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is primarily to help Republicans, who are expected to face tough November elections, regain strength.
So, according to Reuters, these five meetings next week are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Controlling Congress is so critical to its agenda that when it enters the busy pre-election season, the president travels to as many states as possible,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today's meeting, held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in a month. It is a state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, whose preferences in polls lag behind.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to raise his poll preferences,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Courage to Fight and Makes Hopes for Success in Entering Individuals’ Sunday Matches
After three one-sided series, the foursome matches on Saturday afternoon can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The oscillating pendulum of propulsion power is an invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, which side do they think the driving force is on now?
"They led by six points, now it's only four, so we could say that we have a mild driving force now," Spieth said as he was going on his competitive day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, a four-point lead and another twelve in the game.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel a mild wind in their sails and have plenty of reasons for hope, among other things thanks to the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth was unbeatable from the start to the last hole and leads others by his example.
As his wheel progressed, the loud celebratory screams became louder and louder, plunging the key putt, and the fourth match was tied when he and Thomas had two by two less.
His putt, who won the match at 15, celebrated a similar cry, which proves his conviction that the American team is not yet lost in the competition.
“You just have to roll up your sleeves and get into it, just think about your own game,” Spieth said.
None of the players are left with anything else.
18 holes where you need to reach the maximum.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup favourites.
A strange but charming European couple has four out of four and has no way to make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to shoot bogeys on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the other nine holes on Friday morning.
This round and the way the energy flows between the tumultuous crowd and the players confirms that these players will have to be defeated on Sunday, and it is hard to find a more popular player who would solidify a potential European victory at sunset or at the Molwood over the golf course Le Golf National.
Best both at the same time on different holes.
However, the talk of European fame is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played in pairs with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine pits dug a pit for Spain and Sweden, from which they were no longer able to dig.
There's no one here on Sunday to help you get out of the pit.
Fourball and foursome matches are fascinating at a glance because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how the strategy can change from minute to minute.
Europe has played better so far as a team and has substantial leadership to the final day, but these foursomes have also shown that the US team is not afraid to fight, which some, especially on the American continent, have doubted.
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe takes the lead 10:6
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a substantial advantage after finishing Saturday’s fourball and foursome games with a lead against the United States 10:6.
Encouraged duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins over annoying Tiger Woods to score four points on their Le Golf National account so far.
European side Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the failing American side in the morning games of fourball and won the series 3-1.
In the foursome games, the Americans offered more resistance, they won two games, but they were unable to hide their deficit.
Jim Furyk’s side needs eight points out of 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while along with Molinari, under the nickname "Molliwood" they are the second pair to win four points in their opening four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they solidified their performance and defeated depressed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who raced two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but ultimately lost 19 of his 29 games fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who missed the morning games of fourball, returned to accompany Henrik Stenson in the foursome and together defeated 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the unit and three in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not have it in that pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris quite simple.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-pointer year for the Americans on Saturday.
They earned a skeletal 2&1 win over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball games and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the initial two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team manage to get out of a four-point deficit when entering individual matches, although Fury's side as a title defender only needed a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two whole days, it seems that Sunday’s counterattack will apparently be above their strength.
North Korea will not unilaterally disarm "in any way" without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that continuing sanctions had deepened mistrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the world institution that North Korea has taken “substantial countermeasures” over the past year, such as the halting of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear test site, and a commitment not to expand nuclear weapons and technology.
"We do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he added.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to be the first to unilaterally disarm," he said.
While Ri reiterated the well-known complaints of North Korea against Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his view was fundamental in that he did not immediately deny unilateral nuclear disarmament.
Ri referred to a joint position issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea tried to achieve a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to release tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on nuclear disarmament first and increases the level of tension through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner and even by opposing the “declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions will bring us to our knees is an illusion of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the US president told the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the other side of the nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea instead of the United States, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been achieved."
Despite this, Rih’s tone differed dramatically from last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles is inevitable after “Mr. President Evil” Trump called Kim “a rocket launcher on a suicide mission.”
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, sang praise on UN soil to Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there is still a lot of work ahead of him and sanctions must remain until North Korea is taken from the core.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for it, with “it doesn’t matter whether it takes two, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly and without exception until we achieve complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to slash funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the U.N. General Assembly and subsequently said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with the view that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “gangster demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile test site and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
Kim said the "appropriate measures" he expected were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is to get all students more sleep in an effort to suppress the growing trend of studying all night long with the help of caffeine.
Scientists have found that students at a world-leading university are often helpless when it comes to the complete foundations of caring for their health.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Clinic, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
To establish the course, he was inspired by a lecture he gave on sleep deprivation and its impact on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about it now, in my final year?’
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was held this year for the first time, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and sports performance while improving overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health service, said the university decided to open the course when it found that students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the working week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of the boarding room on the screen, where students can click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine, light, and how lack of sleep affects sports performance and how important regularity is.
In the next part, participants will learn how long-term sleep deficits can increase the risk of heart attack, death, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university campus with interactive icons further encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know about it – just as everyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
There is still a culture in which students are proud to be able to learn all night long, he says, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students means sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against weight gain, because sleep deficits put the brain in a mode of starvation, so they are constantly feeling hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his seminars last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to try to implement the course at the university level.
He hopes that in the next step, it will be possible to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before embarking on a challenging study.
Prof. Czeisler advises students to set their alarm clock both at bedtime and at waking time, and to be aware of the damaging effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disturb them by disturbing them.
Livingston 1 : 0 Rangers: Meng's goal sank Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another round of mourning on the outside when Dolly Mengu’s shot condemned the disgruntled team of Steven Gerrard to a 1–0 loss at Livingstone.
Guests from Ibrox attempted to record their first victory outside since a February 4:1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team brought Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 games as manager and left his team at the 8-point position from the leaders of the Premiership squad.
Menga scored seven minutes ahead of halftime, and the Rangers, who were lacking inspiration, weren’t even close to a tie.
While the Rangers have now dropped to sixth, Livingston has climbed to third and is behind the Hibernian with only one goal difference.
And the Rangers may have other problems after line referee Calum Spence suffered a head injury because he was hit by an object apparently thrown from the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, and the Rangers overcame Ayr and reached the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt left the same eleven Livi who took the Hearts point last week, and was thrilled at how his well-assembled team strangled their opponents in every action.
The Rangers may have dominated holding the ball, but Livingston was more active when he got to the ball.
They were only supposed to score in the second minute of the match when the first recall of Menga sent Scott Pittman towards the Allan McGregor gate, but the midfielder lost his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' long direct kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to pass the back bar far.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third they seemed to have hope rather than conviction in their game.
Alfredo Morelos claimed the penalty after a quarter-hour of play when he collided with Steven Lawles, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely pulled Lassan Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejarius' soft shot out of the pitch.
Although Livi’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have been at odds with the course of the game, no one can argue that they deserved it only because of their effort.
The Rangers failed to match Jacobs' corner once again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher moved the ball with a slot to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cool and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerrard took a break, swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the swap had an almost immediate impact when the wing attacker found Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line and blocked him.
But Livingston continued to force the guests to play exactly the kind of game they liked when Lithgow and Halkett shot one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have stretched its lead in the finals, but McGregor defended Jacobs well and then resisted Lithgowa's wide head from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later claimed the penalty when he became involved with Jacobs, but Thomson oversaw it again.
Chronicle: The Inventor of Geiger's Computer
And now here's a page from our Sunday morning chronicle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... it was the day when the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger computer.
Geiger's computer, in addition to being an integral part of science to this day, also became a staple of pop culture when it was talked about in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" cowboys who smelled of science, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s computer, detecting radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you actually hear the sounds of atoms that produce radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Seriously, I hear them cracking!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Lethal Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Lethal Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the harmful cells within the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their adaptation in the laboratory
They then “see” the protein common in many types of cancer and inject back.
The tested vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize leaky cells, lost ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
In this method, the patient’s immune cells are extracted, adjusted in the laboratory to “see” a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and then the cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "supports the growth of several types of cancer" including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and their “learning” how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West with a MAGA cap on his head has become a target of criticism for supporting Trump after performing on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't feel good.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a chaotic performance in which he chanted U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third track called Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap with the inscription Make America Great, he launched an attack on the Democrats and emphasized his support for Trump.
“So many times I’ve talked to some white guy and he said to me, ‘How can you recognize Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The Saturday Night Live (SNL) began a scene with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
While West's statement did not air, comedian Chris Rock posted it on social media.
It’s unclear if Rock tried to make West laugh by sharing.
West also complained to the public that he had had a hard time behind the scenes for his hat.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me, ‘Don’t go there with that hat on your head.’
I was harassed normally.
And then they told me I was down,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how I am at the bottom? I will put on my superman coat, because it means no one will tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments earned a buzz from the audience at least twice, and the other performers in the SNL were embarrassed, Variety magazine reported, with one person telling the media: "The whole study was dominated by a grave silence."
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many when the song I Love It featured dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “A message for one of the bravest souls: WITHOUT BEING AGAINST THE DAVU.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was simply himself and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“I am determined not to retaliate (by buying his music, his clothing, or by promoting his ‘art’) against anyone who, I believe, accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are too," she added.
"Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and from now on he will be 'Ye', formally known as Kanye West."
Not the first artist to change his name, he continues in the footsteps of Diddi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was also called Snoop Lion, and there is of course still the deceased musical legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist, formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbed at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man sustained stab wounds at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police confirmed the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be assessed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, denounced toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword-armed Jon Snow in the harsh medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones from the HBO workshop.
But the 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of a boy hero and said that for such characters on the screen, young boys often feel that they have to be harsh to respect them.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said, “Something is leaking out and thinking about how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones colleague, as well as 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that solving the problem is "very important".
“I personally feel it’s very important to address where we’ve missed something in masculinity,” he said.
“What do we teach men during adolescence when a problem arises that we now see?”
Kit is convinced that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity for its exaggerated masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What does television teach, and what happens on the streets, that young boys feel like they need to have this particular side of masculinity?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
Because it’s clear that something went wrong with the young men somewhere.”
In an interview, he also admitted that when the series ends next summer, he will no longer be filming any extensions or sequels to Game of Thrones, because “he’s done with fights and horses.”
From November, Kit will play in a new adaptation of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is, in his opinion, the best thing that emerged from the series Game of Thrones.
“Thanks to this show, I met my wife, so in a sense she gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, she played Rose Ygritte, the love of the whale character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of the Leslie family’s residence in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, more than 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
As a result of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with a man eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that her employee would leak GOP senators' data, criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denied accusations that a member of her staff would send personal data from three U.S. Republican senators to the legislator's Wikipedia site.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the allegations come from “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and other despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, when it was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate jury hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information has been leaked for some time after three senators interviewed by Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses that identify the source of the leaks are linked to the Waters office and provided information about a Waters staff member, Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated allegation is completely untrue and absolutely false,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of such fraudulent and false allegations was under no circumstances responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely untrue and absolutely false.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, among others from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Her denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
It should not behave defiantly.
It must not challenge the applicant’s motives.
He has to be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer apparently compared Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday’s interrogations.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who runs for Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s big,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant authorities and the authorities involved in the criminal proceedings of fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and they will be legally liable for their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English is Interfering Again – An Undersized Spy Parody of Rowan Atkinson
Nowadays, it is common to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British outlook, and this also applies to this reincarnation of the action comedy parody with Johnny English – which was first introduced in 2003 by the film Johnny English and returned to life in 2011.
Will it become an ironic self-satisfaction about how we are obviously incapable of a new national export article?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English with his distinctive mimicry has got the opportunity to spoil everything again – with his name signaling better than anything else that he is a generous comic creation intended especially for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, the awkward secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to subtle charm, has a little bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr Bean and a spoon of the guy who contributed in the only tone to the opening tune of the 2012 Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.
His character originally comes from an international traveler and mysterious man, who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials on Barclaycard, leaving chaos everywhere.
In this last adventure of Johnny English, one or two pleasant moments can be found.
I liked how Johnny English comes to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the helicopter hits his helmet slightly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is manifested here, but humor evokes a bit of undersized and strangely superficial, especially when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are already offering comedy as one of their components today.
Humor acts as if it’s focused on children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s adventures aren’t as inventive and punctual as Atkinson’s gags without words in Mr. Bean’s handwriting.
The current background of the film story is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK’s top-secret web spy network and, to the dismay of a service-performing agent – Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately missed a small role – has revealed the identities of all British agents in the area.
This is the last drop for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure already on the brink of collapse for political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing what she can with a quasi-Teresa May figure, but she has little to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that if every single active spy has been revealed, she will have to call someone in retirement.
So Johnny English himself comes on the scene, today employed as a director in a certain fashionable institution, who gives private lessons on how to become a secret spy: here are some pleasant gags, as English gives lessons from espionage in the style of the School of Rock.
The Englishmen are then called back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with their former longtime jumper Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, tied to the affected submarine commander, in the role of which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a pity.
So Batman and Robin, who are masters of disasters in Her Majesty's secret services, are back on the field and encounter the beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bullet, in the hand of Olga Kurylenkova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously subject to the line of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd chases: in disguise as waiters, they set fire to a shiny French restaurant; they create chaos when they squeeze into Volt's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use the device to interrupt himself.
All the tricks are pulled out of the sleeve in the last minutes, but no matter how impressive and turbulent, it all acts a bit like a TV show for kids.
The whole impression is more or less average.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I still have to think about why the British film industry is not finally giving Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour backs UK’s four-week workweek plan paid as a five-day payoff
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is said to be considering a radical plan that would allow the British to have a four-day working week but get paid in five days.
The party allegedly wants corporate leadership to redistribute the savings earned by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to give workers an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend, but would carry the same pay at home.
Sources say the idea would “match” the party’s economic plan to incline the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-week workweek has been supported by Congress by trade unions as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “We expect the evaluation of the proposal to be published by the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-week workweek is an effort that matches the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour would not be the first to support this idea. The Greens included a four-day working week in their 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole is not making progress.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party policy, nor does the party consider it.”
The shadow office of John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "anonymous directors" and "rich people" in the service sector.
At the same time, the shadow office’s plans mean that current shareholders in water companies would not regain their entire shares, because the Labour government could apply “coincidences” on the basis of the found fault.
At the same time, he confirmed plans to include employees in the company’s boards of directors and create Inclusive Equity Funds to get 10 percent of private sector companies’ holdings to employees who could receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in the 60 Minutes report, whether the FBI investigation Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh withheld a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the government's findings could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes spokesman Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything they would change their minds about.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I said when I went to the hearing, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges were brought, and I asked, ‘Did you do that?’
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.”
However, Graham’s voice seems to be firmly established.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and there would have to be some unsubstantiated accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently denied everything," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And no one who appoints him can confirm that.
This thing is 36 years old.
I don’t see how anything could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and can it contribute to poverty reduction?
On Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive crowd of stars with an even more impressive mission: to end the world hunger.
In their seventh year, tens of thousands of people will gather on the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to end the extreme 20th century.
The Global Citizen Festival, held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If viewers want to get a ticket for a free event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), they must complete a series of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or any other meaningful way to raise their awareness of the event.
There are still 12 years left, so how much is Global Citizen really able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert in an appropriate way to persuade them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – when people feel that they are really making a difference when they sign an online petition or write on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from their supporters, moving towards a variety of goals.
The organization claims that these actions helped provoke world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group said that 390 commitments and statements had emerged from its shares, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers who have pledged to “help children reach their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million in donations to help end the country’s 700 million livelihood.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a thing of the past,” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 events calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government has announced funding for The Power of Nutrition, which will provide 5 million women and children with nutritional contributions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and demanding journey – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just like the big civil rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the personalities who will perform at this year’s New York event, along with moderators Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "blockade" to restrict Russian energy exports, says Secretary of the Interior
“If necessary,” Washington may call its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke revealed, cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in Syria – where they are acting at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I am convinced that the main reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy there exactly as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern stomach of Europe," he said.
According to him, there are ways and methods to deal with it.
“The United States can, by using the navy, ensure that maritime routes remain open, and, if necessary, make a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at an event held under the auspices of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is positioning itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less fuel use and replacement," he said, mentioning that Russia has only one trick in its pocket because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration went on a mission to support liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, making Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s zealous opposition to the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I am convinced that we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance brought resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industry Union (BDI), urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with when a third country interferes with our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Association (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be “seriously considering” the 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the presidential election.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential candidacy.”
Warren told President Donald Trump during a meeting at the town hall that she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“To the bones, I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, she tweeted, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think she should run for office in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center, fifty-six percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said that a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among Democrats who are being talked about in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Speaks at Donald Trump’s Meeting on PTSD Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was taken to the military on September 11, 2007 and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“With what my own son has been going through since he returned, I can identify with other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” she told spectators at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that "they're coming home a little bit different, tougher, they're coming back with the question of whether people have respect for what their fellow fighters and airmen give them and all the other members of the arts."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women, interference with reports of domestic violence, and possession of a gun in a narcotic condition, Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett said.
18 states and D.C. will support opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal objection to a new U.S. policy refusing asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. filed amicus curiae in Washington on Friday in support of asylum seekers' objections to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons, members of a violent gang," were abusing her, but U.S. authorities rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Representatives of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a high number of U.S. asylum seekers come, as nations facing a serious problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a decision violates this principle,” the amicus curiae filing states.
Representatives further argued that policies that oppose immigrants are damaging the U.S. economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum should never have been designed to solve all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face on a daily basis around the world.
The death toll in Palu has doubled and desperate efforts are underway to rescue survivors
For those who were rescued, the situation continued to deteriorate.
“It’s very tense,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while trying to shake up her restless son in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“An ambulance carries bodies every minute.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes, dig into their flooded things, and rescue everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, burst into tears.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered spine and shoulder fractures, rested outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside for severe concussions.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered the feeling of a devastating earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think the falling ruins pushed me to the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” through “propaganda ads”
A week after Chinese newspapers published a four-page ad promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused China of using U.S. pressure to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid ad by China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the state’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, but China denies the allegation.
According to U.S. officials, Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s attempt to interfere in the U.S. election are a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war in which both sides adjust tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade conflict were expected to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in his contribution to the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing its promotional ads in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, China is harnessing America’s venerated tradition of freedom of expression and free press by publishing paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in a newspaper stand on the streets here in Beijing, you will find only limited disagreements and you will not expect any real picture of the diverse views that Chinese citizens may have on China’s problematic economic trajectory,” as the media are under strong control of the party.
He added that "some of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his offer" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was about.
Analysts warn that for the debacle with Kavanaugh, Republicans have a chance at female voters
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that this will be overlooked in the upcoming interim elections, especially by women.
The emotions accompanying this case were extraordinarily strong and the majority of Republicans have already expressed their desire to join the vote.
“These things cannot be returned,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School University in Syracuse, told The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the FBI's last-minute request to investigate Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, not even in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, an advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, demonstrators chanted in the hallways of the Senate, “November is coming!” as Republicans in the Judiciary Commission decided to continue Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will cross all borders,” Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news portal.
“People say that motivation is already high; and that’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among indecisive women in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who don’t like the president, but often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she gave details of her sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there could be a sharp reaction if the Republicans confirmed their support for him.
"For the GOP, it has become a big mess," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Commission, told NBC News at the beginning of last week.
“It’s not just a commission vote or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench, it’s also about how the Republicans approached it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of the U.S.-based Priorities group that helps vote Democrats, told the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided as to who to trust at dawn in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with favor leaning more toward Ford.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being fired by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Commission under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate revealed her genitals when they attended a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global network world wide web plans to launch a new Internet to surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup that will want to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, called Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide whether their data is stored and who is allowed to access the individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was “dominating the world.”
“We have to get into it now,” he said of the start-up.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and work tools.
It’s something like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, and they’re all available on a single browser at the same time.
On the personal online data storage, the unique thing is that only the user decides who will have access to the individual types of information.
The company calls this the “strengthening of personal powers through data.”
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s intention is to bring the resources, process and appropriate skills that make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several internal developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world have been able to start creating their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.

Priest Bernard Vann: the celebration of the bearer of the Viktoria Cross for the First World War
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Cross of Victory as a warrior during the First World War was celebrated on the occasion of his 100th birthday in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned of the highest British military honor.
At a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "amazingly symbolic" that the board was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning heroic fight.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his flag across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very dense fog and a heavy firing of field weapons and machine guns."
Later, he hurried across the line of fire and, with “the highest courage,” led the soldiers forward, disarming himself with three of the field weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something I'll never get close to in my life, but it evokes a deep sense of humility in me."
Together with their brother, Dr. James Vann, they placed a wreath at the end of the accompaniment, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to attend the accompaniment" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support expressed by many people."
Fans of MMA waited until late at night to finish Bellator 206 and instead received the series Pig Peppa
Imagine staying up all night to watch the thrilling Bellator 206 finals and finally not seeing the main event.
The schedule from San Jose included 13 matches, including six major ones, and was broadcast live in the UK all night long on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were to face each other, the viewers in the UK were shocked when Pig Peppa appeared on the screen instead of the broadcast.
Some were really disappointed, because they waited until the morning especially for this match.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's fairy tale as "some kind of sick joke."
“It’s a government regulation that since 6:00 a.m., this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, said in a statement.
"Yeah, it was 'Peppa Prasyatko'."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work to make their broadcasts available to viewers in the UK in the future.
“When I think of repetitions, I think we’ll be able to sort it out somehow,” Coker said.
“But it is Sunday at six o’clock in the morning of their time, and we will not be able to resolve it before Sunday of our time, that is, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it came out, we exchanged a lot of messages and they weren't exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a matter of government regulations.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Let’s cut it down to five games instead of six – as we usually do – we tried to give the fans a little bit more and pulled it out.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Undervalued’ for His Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says that during his teenage years he felt inferior to others for his sexuality – but that’s what motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said that only in high school did he realize that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to care a little less about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
In his first show with Laverne Daley, he said he felt "less like everyone else during his teenage years, because it was socially unacceptable for anyone to like both boys and girls."
In his own words: “To this day, I really felt inferior and different, and that gave me the strength and motivation to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, not to let everyone down after they learned about his sexuality.
The double-bronze Olympic medalist has become a leading fighter for LGBT rights and has used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give this “hope” to others as well.
The three-time world champion said he was “surprised” when he fell in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem for them.
“If you survive that much at a young age” – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer – “it is difficult to find a peer who would experience similar successes and misfortunes.”
The couple became parents in June, their son Robert Ray Black-Daley was born, and Daley said his "whole worldview" had changed.
“If you asked me a year ago, I would just talk about how I need to win a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
“Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the idea of death and one of the last things he was asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — because he wanted to be in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, Father, you won’t be here anymore so you can sit in the first row,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and he was dead did I finally recognize that he is not immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that’s exactly what I’ve dreamed of my whole life – jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
The story was also inspired by his selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – which impressed him in preparation for the Olympics and still causes him to die in winter.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in weak form set for Saturday's Ryder Cup matches
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to show up in better shape so it won't be an unhappy milestone for him.
Mickelson, who plays at the two-year event for the record 12 times, was deposed by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's games of fourball and foursome.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as many times before for the U.S., the five-time winner spent the day alternately encouraging and improving his game in the hope of improving his reputation.
The 48-year-old didn’t shoot the most direct at the height of his career, which isn’t ideal for the tight Le Golf National, where usually wrong shots are fired in the long field.
And as if the field itself wasn’t challenging enough, Mickelson faces in Sunday’s ninth match the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who managed to win all the matches this week in a pair with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans who lag four points before the start of 12 individual matches succeed in getting a good start, Mickelson’s performance could be absolutely key.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, kicked me on the back, grabbed my arm around and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has high self-confidence.
He is a member of the Siena of Fame and in the past and also this week has made a significant contribution to our team.
I couldn’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but this is how it crystallized, and we felt that this is exactly how we had to do it.
He wants to be out on the lawn, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson beats Nick Fald’s record in the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It could be the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, which has never reached the heights of his individual balance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 passes and 7 draws, although Furyk says his presence has brought some incalculable value to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make jokes about people, and he’s a great companion,” he said.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him and it was great to watch it.
It’s not just in his game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that strong leadership may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his own experience that the considerable lead in entering individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable ride.
The Danish golfer made his debut at a 1997 game in Valderrama, where he had a five-point lead over the Americans under captain Sev Ballesteros, but nevertheless crossed the finish line with the narrowest possible win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I have to constantly remember how strong we had leadership at Valderrama; we had strong leadership at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama we did win, but that’s just the way it was,” Bjorn said in the photo, after the 2018 team won 5:3 on Friday and yesterday led at Le Golf National with a score of 10.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that the game is not over yet.
Tomorrow, we'll go on full gas.
We'll stand on the lawn and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the table, the game is not over.
We have our goal, and that is to win this trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
As I said from the beginning, I’m focusing on 12 players on our side, but I’m also well aware that we’re on the other side – against the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the success of his players on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have preceded events.
There's another fight ahead of us tomorrow.
Tomorrow will be an individual performance, and that is something completely different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with your partner when you’re successful, but when you stand there by yourself, it will fully test all your golfing abilities.
This is a message that players need to remember to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner and he has to go and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, colleague Jim Furyk will want his players to play better than individuals did as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the big tournaments last day when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he was defeated when Europe reached the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to the last day in 1999.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start fast as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Medina.
When this driving force runs in one direction, those midfield matches are extremely important.
“We created our band and placed the boys in a way that we felt we were going to try to do some magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and faced Rory McIlroy in the highest match, while the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, were in the top half of the line.
“I went with this group of boys in this order because I thought that’s how we’d go all the way,” Bjorn said of his selection of individuals.
Germany's new warship was postponed again
Local media reported that the latest German Navy frigate was due to be put into service in 2014 as a replacement for an aging Cold War warship, but that won't happen until next year due to faulty systems and cost accumulation.
The commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of a completely new class of frigates from Baden-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered after delivering troubling problems.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain powerful work, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic tracks.
Other important functions include a longer periodicity of maintenance – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside home ports.
Continuous delays mean, however, that the state-of-the-art warships that have enabled Germany to demonstrate power overseas become obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate frigate F125 got into the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited several major "software and hardware failures" that made the warship useless when deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship has a significant overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is considered twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), up from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important given the recent warnings that the German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, confirmed that the navy "does not actually have a ship capable of deployment".
The government spokesman said that the issue had been raised over time because old ships had been decommissioned but no replacement ships had been provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the navy.
National Trust reveals secret life of bats
A new study, underway in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how bats use the country for their food hunting.
We hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future nature conservation activities.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow stinging bats and sand bats, as well as light and water bats in the Inverewe gardens in the Wester Ross area.
Special loggers are placed at key locations around the property to monitor bats’ activities throughout the season.
Employees of this organization and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls of bats and activity of individual species.
They then create a map of their natural environment and management to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a large scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the natural environment are most important to bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help determine the benefits of environmental management work, such as meadow formation, and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work, which has an impact on grassland growth and environmental loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats, can be a danger.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, their ears are like eyes when it comes to hunting benefits.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to accurately identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of assemblies and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even established the first and only protected area for bats in the Threave kingdom in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have an amazing space for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of protected trees and all good habitats.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we’re doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It stresses that it is important to check bats before performing maintenance within the property, because it is possible that the unwitting destruction of one maternal assembly could kill up to 400 females and young, which would likely destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, abuse, disrupt, or destroy their assemblies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved in the aid.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we simply don’t know how many of our species feed.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, while lawyers filed a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls allegations of rape “fake news” and says people want to “show up” using his name.
His lawyers filed a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A Portuguese and Juventus striker has been charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were released, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers during a live Instagram interview, calling the allegations “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“They want to be visible by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
“I’m a lucky man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel magazine for charges they called “an inadmissible report of privacy suspicions.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages at the level of the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room after meeting at a nightclub, where he allegedly raped her anally.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a “99 percent good guy” who was disappointed by “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “fearful of retaliation” and feared “public humiliation.”
A 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to reconsider the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer moved to Italian giant Juventus with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' loss of car manufacturers
The UK "would forever regret" losing its status as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark said.
He said it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at a factory in Burnastone near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border crossings in the event of a no-deal Brexit could reduce jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are about what carmakers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just in time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, borders could be disrupted, leading to delays and a lack of components in industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep in its Derbyshire plant more than the daily value of inventories, the company said, and production would thus cease.
Mr Clark said Mrs May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to prevent these border controls".
“We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to not just talk about the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is the fact that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnastone for 24 years and is a member of the union in the race, said that his members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, when these jobs disappear, they will never return.
The government spokesman said: “We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s fight for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the election, the links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and potential dismissals of the president’s investigation.
Whether Trump will fire or not fire the Attorney General’s deputy, threatening Mueller’s independence, Washington has been messing around for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of using wiretapping to record conversations with Trump and dismiss the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
He went to the White House last Monday, with new information revealing that he was about to step down.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was witnessed by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the one-week FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing a full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The deadline for this was not set, it could be this week, I understand the shift to another week considering all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
We will always be happy to report to the press.”
Some reporters have denied the claim: Sanders has not held a short press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of short press conferences was not caused by opposition to television reporters who want to dazzle, although she said, “I don’t agree with the fact that they want to dazzle.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press should be increased.
“The president is making more meetings based on the concept of questions and answers than any other president before him,” she said, without providing any evidence.
Sanders said, “If the press has a chance to ask a question directly to the President of the United States, it’s incomparably better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and in the last few weeks you have seen us really often, there will be a brief press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guest ranks.
Separate press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, when he appeared freely and several times even bizarrely in front of the gathered journalists.
Secretary of Health writes to EU staff at the National Health Service in Scotland on Brexit concerns
The health secretary wrote to EU employees working at the National Health Service in Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applications for permanent residence of EU citizens working within the framework of its transferred public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations have continued, which are heading towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie to undergo emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Reed told reporters he was injured shortly before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and somehow collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before storing him on the stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State team official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is in a Vanderbilt health center after surgery.
Harris added that there were "no details on the type/size of the injury" and the Tennessee State team is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student at the university, is in his first season with the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday before leaving the game, he had five total strikes, bringing him a total of 18 strikes this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher turnover fees when they buy a property in the United Kingdom.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher turnover fees when they buy a property in the UK, which will provide additional cash to help the homeless under the new Conservative plans.
This move neutralizes the success of Corbyn’s effort to attract young voters
An increase in the tax on hips will be collected from those who do not pay tax in the UK
The state treasury expects to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged higher bills when they buy a property in the UK. The additional cash will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success aimed at attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-income individuals.
An increase in the tax on hips will be collected from individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK, additional funding will support the government in the fight against sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current hip tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and real estate for rent after purchase, could be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this step to bring funding of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents who are not residents of the United Kingdom, raising prices and making it difficult for buyers who buy a property for the first time to get into the housing system.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" for a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new strategy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower hip to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by fighting for land but not using it, and urged May to waive quotas for affordable housing to repair Britain’s “shame of housing.”
Corbyn announced a sweeping series of proposed housing reforms, including controlling rent and ending evictions "without guilt".
At the same time, it wants to give the committees more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my function to renewing the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
This means strengthening our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, we cannot allow it to be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as for companies based abroad to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street remains too real.”
Jack Ross: “My main ambition is to lead Scotland”
Sunderland football team boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying a challenge to revive the northeastern club, which is currently in third place in the League One competition, three points from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after signing with St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a baseball cap and it was," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportssound.
“As a child, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, and that’s something that always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I’m successful in managing the club.”
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has no fears that such acclaimed names will follow in such a large club, having previously rejected bids from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success will be measured by whether I can ‘bring this club back to the Premier League’.
“Because of its structure and equipment, this club certainly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“Getting there is not an easy task, but I would probably consider myself a success if I could only get the club there.”
Ross has only been in his management position for three years, after a period of serving as an assistant chief at Dumbartone and a 15-month alternate in the position of coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped the Alloa team recover from the descent into the third league and changed the St Mirren team from the edge of the descent to the championship winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real breakup," he recalled as he joined the Alloa team.
“I really believed that management is more appropriate for me than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well, I ensured a reasonable standard of living and enjoyed some reasonable maxims.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still do it when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but in management I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to drive and now I’m doing it, which makes me feel like I’m in the right place like I’ve never been in my entire adult life.”

The summer heat increased sales in British bars fighting for survival, but increased the pressure on the restaurant chain.
Data revealed that the cramps and bars sector saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant sales declined by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s trade adviser, said: “The continued sunny weather and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar trend to the previous month, June, when revenues increased by 2.8%, with the exception of hardships.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurant services in June only worsened in July.
The inns with a drinks offer and a bar fared much better than the restaurants, which, taking into account the same factors, saw a decline.
Taverns with food offer also saw a decline, though not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go for a drink.
Within cramps and bars, beverage sales grew by 6.6% this month, with food falling by 3%.”
RSM Hospitality and Leisure Analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the year-on-year drop in sales of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful given the continued pressures on costs.
A long hot summer could not have come for operators with food on offer at a worse time, and time will show whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed relaxation.”
Overall sales growth in taverns and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the introduction of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales monitoring for the UK industry of taverns, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an established industry standard.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Research reveals that one in five children, some under the age of 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “false Instagram accounts”
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of pupils said they have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children, some under the age of 11, creates social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of “false Instagram accounts” – a photo-sharing page.
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of pupils reported running a harmless “main” account, which they show their parents, while also having private ones.
One mother, who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenage girl insisting on others to rape her.
Research conducted by the Digital Awareness Organisation in the UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40% of the population aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online sites where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘the voice of athletes’ in Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most successful athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie has described this move as a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has tremendous respect between the Scottish, British and world athletic communities and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit by bringing it to the board of directors,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to act as the voice of athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a 200-meter and 400-meter run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and together won four Olympic gold medals and is a regular BBC commentator, has overcome a transient ischemic attack and is now unable to walk.
He tweeted: “A month ago I suffered a death.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It’s exhausting work, but I managed to heal completely, I learned to walk again and today I’m doing agility exercises.
“Thank you for the encouraging news!”
Next articleAdvertisement for a breast milk suction cup comparing mothers with cows shares opinions in the online world
The company for the manufacture of suction cups for breast milk has divided opinions in the online world with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with breastfeeding mothers.
To mark the launch of the world’s ‘softest portable breast milk extractor’, consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a podcast music video to showcase the freedom the new extractor gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack filled with cows on a song that contains lyrics like, "Yes, I suck milk, but you don't see any tails" and "If you didn't notice that they're not whales, they're my breasts."
The refrain continues: “I pump, I pump, I feed babies, I pump, I pump, I suck out my beauties.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, opened up controversy in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked mixed reactions among viewers, with many saying it disregards the dairy industry’s “horrors.”
“It is a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, except that we will steal their babies within a few days of giving birth,” one woman wrote.

Another user commented: “It’s understandably traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to promote breast milk suction cups for mothers who keep their children?”
Someone else added: “Advertising is detached from reality.”
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that the song seemed to her “gifted.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy a suction cup if I was still breastfeeding.
When I sucked in the milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I take it the way it is.
It’s a brilliant product,” one woman wrote.
Another user commented: “A fun ad aimed at moms who suck milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with discreet suction cups of breast milk wrapped in bra.
The concept of the campaign is based on an understanding of the fact that many women who suck milk out say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast milk suction cup is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to keep children and even suck and spend time outdoors.
Ana Balarin, a partner and mother in the Early Childhood Development programme, commented: “Elvie’s breast milk extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves to be boldly and provocatively marketed.
By drawing a parallel between women’s and dairy’s expressions, we wanted to place the suction of breast milk and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in a fun and telling way the incredible sense of freedom that the new suction cup will bring.
It's not the first time that Ellie has appeared in the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the show pier for designer Marta Jakubowska, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children peacefully moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained has increased, although monthly crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and practices put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children thanks to supporters.
Traditionally, the majority of supporters were the illegal immigrants themselves, and they feared that they would jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by stepping forward with the right to a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officer Matthew Albence told Congress that the office had arrested dozens of people who had applied for support for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
“About 80 percent of individuals who are either supporters or members of the family of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large number of them are foreign nationals with criminal records.
So we continue to monitor these individuals," Mr Albence said.
Officials trying to deal with matters relating to children more quickly have introduced new rules that will require some of them to be brought to court within one month of detention and not after 60 days as per the previous standard, the staff said in a statement.
Many will present themselves via video conferencing and not in person to refer their case in relation to the legal status of the immigration judge.
Those who are classified as not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to run out of anxiety or depression, which can lead to a crackdown on violence or attempts to flee, shelter workers said, and reports emerged in the system in recent months.
Advocates said these fears are increasing in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is suffering are more overlooked due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to friends could cause the trauma that many are struggling with.
Syria will tell US, French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who has addressed the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “we will treat them accordingly.”
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over in Syria". Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died here, with millions being driven out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until it clears all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and the “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and radioing Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were appropriate for their return and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fear,” leading refugees to stay out of their homes.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a bumper zone in the last major insurgent stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has deterred a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had "clear terms" and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front linked to al-Qaida, which "will be removed".
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members in order to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the group's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will have a second term in office
With this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, although a number of liberal viewers are likely to hope that his presidential office will end the prosecution and scandal prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be the “most dramatic finale of the presidential office at all”!
So far, there are no signs of spectators getting tired.
Since 2014, the average viewership in the main broadcast time on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and on MSNBC it has nearly mapped to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in major broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and “The Show with Rachel Maddow” on MSNBC has a top rating with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
“This is a hoax that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” Neal Baer, creator of the drama “President in Order” program, told ABC about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, an experienced author of comedy and series "Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has a different theory.
Before the 2016 election, he remembers driving a taxi in Boston.
The driver told her she would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "because it's funny," Scovella told me.
There is a fun value in this chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, stories from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade dispute, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
But it’s already beyond the reach of an informed citizen when you find out that you’ve been watching a six-hour Washington group of experts talk about the “deeper background” as the source of Bob Woodward’s book Fear, Paul Manafort’s bomber leather jacket of ostrich worth 15,000 dollars, a rough piece of Trump’s underwear.
I’ll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does is reminiscent of a reality show that feeds you with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the daily broadcast of Trump’s show with a recurring part of the show.
You can’t afford to skip an episode because you’d be behind.
When I came to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside on the north bank of Kauai it was 26 degrees sun, but he was staying inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from that, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
“I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past and people saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was just a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

The money from the outside will go to the elections for a chair in the middle of the term of office
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is being flooded with money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts, which resulted in two candidates falling into a one-size-fits-all battle.
This recently rebuilt suburban district of Pittsburgh stands in opposition to Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps strongly with the new 17th District.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The fight in the new 17th district affected the financing of the campaign between the main party financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Committee of Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely watched March Special Elections to the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The city was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador instead of supporting China, then resigned.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight departure from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated Trump’s management organizational team.
Foreign ministry officials have decided to appeal the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions that no longer recognize Taiwan,” ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were taken into account only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rate.
As the internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from being sent to the United States.
In mid-September, however, the chief administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any assessment of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now addressing a conference scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance of the assembly that the administration is entrusting to him, diplomats said.
Three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new serious news or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the debate Mr Bolton described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations under conditions of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history.
Another unexpected event could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, of which there is now very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation into whether the Trump campaign was linked to Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changed the party, Trump would face responsibility in this body just as he prepares to go before the voters again and perhaps even a jury of his members of the House.
That’s a lot of conditions if I don’t want to imply that Trump’s fall is necessary – not even his equivalent in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice as to how it can affect the prolongation of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but the West would have to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflexible points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
The Americans are now facing some of these inflexible points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was announced in this report that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated about his incapacity to execute the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' explanation is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the middle of the congressional term that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will be stored for a fairly long winter’s sleep.
I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on that crochet table.
With such a past, I simply have to be optimistic.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers feels optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that winning over the Austrians in the wake of an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented backer Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time this season, only after a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers team can use this result as a bridge for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and believed we could win something and we left with a point.
We may have been able to achieve this in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were better in the second half and we were a better team.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
Let’s hope we can score three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the fans behind us, I’m sure we can push them and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough given my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a factor in why we feel good.
That’s good and the boys really enjoy it, we have a great training.
Let’s hope that we now push last season backwards and we will be successful.”
Women don’t sleep because of fears associated with retirement disputes
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family members.
Approximately half of the individuals in the nationwide study reported talking to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they won’t take steps to talk,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the point where you have to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t present your wishes to them in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance contract, a hybrid life insurance contract that will help cover those expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you have that money.
Elaborate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles during a crisis.
Get a health care practitioner to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are not able to communicate.
Also consider the strength of a legal representative for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure the payment of your bills if you fail to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about the money, it’s also about who will be the doctors,” Martin asked.
“What will the medicines be?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep this plan in place.”
Multiple-gunned man with air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times by an air rifle when he left the house at night.
The victim, 40, was shot in the chest, belly and hand in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are urgently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with an expected increase in the number of victims.
Due to paralyzed communication, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain any information from the regent’s office in Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region belonging to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic backbone of the central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, the cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by the tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck the western part of Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies seismically in the Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in Indonesia's northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, outside Sumatra, and triggered a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidia Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused the temporary imprisonment of thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
29-year-old Palin, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in the execution of a report on domestic violence, and resistance to arrest, according to a report released by Alaska State Driving Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when his acquaintance tried to call the police to report the said crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin remains in custody at an investigative facility in Mat-Su and is detained on an uncovered $500 bond, the KTUU television station reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said in his defense that he was "not guilty, certainly," the television station said.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to one year and face a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, sentenced to one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in a crime report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior with PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical networks and communications networks are not functioning, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty on suspicion of terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been awarded for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck on Oct. 31 to carry out an attack on a bicycle route along the West Side highway in lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and a cyclist on the route.
According to the announcement of the start of the death penalty proceedings filed in the southern district of New York, if prosecutors want to achieve the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious injury.
According to the court document, the death penalty is awarded for both of these prosecutions.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal investigative jury filed a 22-point indictment against Saipo, which included eight prosecutions of murder with intent to extort, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and prosecution of us.
The attack required “substantial planning and cold-blooded thinking,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov executed it as “disgusting, cruel and perverted.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadto, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damianuza."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sentenced to death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs. The couple was executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, according to court documents, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he had a good feeling about what he had done, police said.
Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
Police said he had also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
At the address of the prosecution, with 22 points, he stated that he was not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and life spent in prison without the possibility of release only prolongs the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit talks
Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party said politicians had to "meet an unpleasant situation" from Eurosceptics when one member of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative House MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham in March that the UK would be “already gone” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge May faces in mitigating her deeply divided ranks has been underscored by conservatives with a pro-life stance who have joined in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister tries to maintain a compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, permanence supporters and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue to seek an agreement with Brussels despite opposition, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr Bone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave group that he wanted to dismiss the prime minister.
He proposed to Mr Farage that he be involved and responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If it was up to him, we'd be out," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will stand for Brexit, but we need to dismiss the prime minister.”
He expressed his disagreement with the EU, saying: “We did not fight in world wars to be subject.
We want to create our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bone rejected the view that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, telling reporters: “Just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The prime minister is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for her, it is unpopular with our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and getting us in the first place.
“Please leave the Prime Minister alone and start listening.”
In a well-received message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their seats when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the assembly that politicians must “feel anger” if they betray a 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of betraying Brexit, to feel our anger.”
“We are mobilizing the people of this country, who gave us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, people marched through Birmingham to stay, and then held a two-hour gathering in the city centre.
Many activists waved banners to the Conservatives against Brexit. The group was founded this weekend.
A member of the Labour Party, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the Conservatives for security issues with the party's application at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have information systems and all the technology in place for the border without trains and for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to “rethink” her candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will consider her candidacy for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting of the city hall on Saturday in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against state Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was speculated that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting at the city hall since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was “time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top.”
Arrested to shoot Sims at LSU University
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of Friday’s shooting and asked for help identifying the man caught on video footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near a college boarding school at Southern University on Friday early in the morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247sports network.
Wayde went to help his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being present, carrying a gun, and confessed to shooting Wayne Sims.
Simpson was arrested and imprisoned at the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
The two-meter junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the team's orders brought him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has been revealed that Mercedes’s commands will play a significant role in the race.
From the best starting position, Bottas got a good start and almost put Hamilton in an awkward situation as he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went into the boxes and let Hamilton go into traffic on the group's tail, which was to be decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxing stop a lap later and walked out to Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a tight run in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside with the risk of having to defend a third time after the double pull.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh until the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race as he held onto the lane and focused on a quick finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and reaching fourth place.
He eventually got into boxing in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri worked fantastically all weekend and he was a real gentleman and let me pass by.
He has done an exceptional job, he has an exceptional combination of two strong personalities," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body word.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at the assembly on Saturday for urging her not to publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at the assembly in West Virginia, he did not directly address the testimony Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead noting that what was happening in the Senate showed that the people were “greedy, disgusting, and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen, and that beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and greedy and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
When you look at the disclosures and leaks and they say, “Oh, I didn’t do it.”
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you publish it?
Remember her answer... you published the document – “oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
All right, wait a minute.
We published... No, we did not publish,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the letter was released in early September — but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t publish her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
However, it does not seem to fit the president’s denial, who said during Saturday’s meeting: “I tell you what, it was really a bad word of the body.
Maybe she didn’t, but she had the worst body word I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president hinted that Democrats were using claims for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power by all necessary means.
“You see vileness, indecency, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals behind the Giants against the Dundee hockey team
The Dundee Stars made it past the Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the revenge match in Dundee 5:3 on Saturday.
The Giants won an early two-point lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Thanks to Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie, the homes settled, but Dwyer subsequently restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee, but Lukas Lundvald gave Nielsen two goals to ensure their victory.
It was the third loss of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe, who reversed the score and defeated the Dundee team 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between rivals, when the Giants won in the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the game in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFaull assisting, and four minutes later with David Rutherford, when Beauvillier doubled the lead.
During the busy opening part, Sullivan returned the homers back to play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt secured a draw for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants led the team to the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The homers regrouped and Bouchard again equalized by using a goal during the game without a goalkeeper in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen for the first time in the match to secure the lead of the Dundee team in the second half and he took care of the victory in the middle of the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home in Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Flight operator dies to ensure plane with hundreds of passengers escapes before landslide
A flight operator in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died after securing the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to plague the area and many people are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in a wildly moving swinging tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He remained in place to ensure that flight 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could save hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning when the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“We were very saddened to find out,” he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear that the number of casualties could reach thousands. Disaster mitigation agency in the country says there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number is likely to continue to rise because many bodies were still under debris and many people could not be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugro's spokesman said.
The waves, which reached up to six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral takes place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance carries bodies every minute.
Pure water is rare.
Small markets are all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earthquakes hit Indonesia earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports one man missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline operating the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one man is missing, after earlier reporting that it had safely evacuated all 47 passengers and crew from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday afternoon they found that one man was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the landing runway began.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It was a great deal of luck," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to cross the deep water through the belt to emergency exits in a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers working nearby to improve the pier also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat that brought people to shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network databases suggest that over the past two decades, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any accident.
Analyst determines the timeline of the night during which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday concluded the indictment in a reopened trial against a man accused of burning down a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He sketched for a jury how he used cell phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, Chambers, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lieing because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Jessica Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to make its final statements on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to take place that day before the jury.
The High Breed: What Is Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip-hop has diverted from its origins of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and re-popularize conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are reviving glory in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
And another black one?!
New York Nurse Sues Couple for 'Racist' Text Message
A New York nurse sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrect text message from a mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed shock when she found out that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"NIEEEEEEEE, OTHER BLACK", Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after the “shameful” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman realized her insanity, she fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that their departing caretaker, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Ms Maurice is now suing a couple for compensation for dismissal and is demanding compensation of $350 per day for a period of six months, for work with accommodation at the employer for which she was originally hired, even without a contract.
“I want to show them that such things are not done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple are opposed to claims of being racist, defending and defending that ending Mrs Maurice’s employment was a reasonable thing because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you give your children into the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
But go."
Comparing the lawsuit to "extortion", Plasco said his wife had a baby only two months old and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Would you go after someone like that?
That’s not a very nice thing,” added the investment banker.
While the court dispute is still ongoing, the public has quickly condemned the couple on social media, taunting their behavior and logic.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Won't Have a Relationship with a Speaking Bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to find yourself in the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know what we know about Paddington’s huge success now.”
She said her father was optimistic about the rejection of his work. Before he got the idea and wrote a children's book about a little bear, he worked as a cameraman for the BBC. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "hot-sweet" for his death last year.
She added that Paddington's eventual success, which she described as "a very important member of our family," was quietly proud of her father.
“He was a very quiet man and he wasn’t a praiser,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your doing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington credit for himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, she and her daughter rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to do it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me and said she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to her by doctors to keep her heart functioning, slowly absorbed and left her system.
She died just before, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside other passengers, regardless of the suffering she had endured.
“Nobody knew about it,” she said.
“I had my head tilted and I was crying.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt tremendous compassion for Nad.
I realized that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women's Suicides Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide try to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place links to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and died at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to experience what I have to experience every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile would brighten every room.
However, he gave up his work before he died, because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling after taking his own life.
Ms Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have a chain effect.”
Ms. Davis created links, “to let people know that there are people you can come to and talk to, even when it’s a friend.
“Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Davies's long-time friend, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his mood swing.
On Easter Day it was the full day, when the children opened their gifts, he did not look at them or anything else.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to get through it: “It’s going to make a hole across the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as FBI begins investigation
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something he was asking for - a time or scope-limited investigation - we could agree on something," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the commission would "dissolve."
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unwillingness is due to timing.
Elections in the middle of the term are only five weeks away, November 6 - if Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbyed to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush at the White House, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI draws up a report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to change the indecisive outcome and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Deserters 'Decline' Under Kim's Government
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Byeong-seug Park, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said there were 1,127 deserters last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors are tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by carriers.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, representatives of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at suspending denuclearisation talks.
This came after the historic June meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work on a nuclear-free peninsula in a broader sense.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the lack of progress was caused by U.S. sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
The Senate minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was inappropriate for serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Speech Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman did, they would say she’s ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking when discussing his family and high school period.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him a “grotesque and coordinated type of assassination” organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Ms Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony can prove he can't serve in the Supreme Court because he turns out to be interested in Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he’s harassing the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi avoided speaking when asked whether she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if his nomination was confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only fit to be in the Supreme Court, he’s fit to be in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or in Roe v. Wade’s case because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
“Isn’t it time for a hysterical, interested person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘No, isn’t that wonderful?’”
And women have to control it.
It’s a legitimate attack, months and years of rage that can’t be held back, and she can’t talk about it without crying.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “A woman who was a leading worker helped me a lot and said that she also cried when she was angry, but she started using the procedure, that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m so sad.
I'm angry.'
And then she just went on.
I think it's great."
Tears are partly allowed as a way out of anger because they are extremely misunderstood.
One of my clearest recollections of an early job in a mostly male office where I once cried out of indescribable anger is when an older woman, a cold manager I’ve always been a little scared of, grabbed behind the back and pulled me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you crying,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they got under your skin.”
Patricia Schroeder, a later Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his campaign for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and ended his candidacy, deeply frustrated Ms. Schroeder realized that there was no single reason why she should not deal with the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the game and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it “The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the campaign had been running for a long time, she was lagging behind in raising funds, so she promised not to get into the game if she didn’t earn $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1000, would give her only $250.
“Do you think I’m on the left?” she asked.
During her speech about not launching an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by so much emotion – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to get money and focus on voters rather than delegates – and the sexism.
“You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled in response to the press.
“You might have thought that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what I was going to write on the back of my head.
“The one who cried?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Good for Beijing
The initial salve of a trade war between the US and China has been deafening and while the battle is not far from over, the conflict between the countries may be of long-term benefit to Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week took place with new tariffs affecting items worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has paid off in the same way each time, with tariffs of five to ten percent recently on $60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised to deal with US tactics and the world’s second-largest economy probably won’t step down anytime soon.
Achieving Washington’s concession would mean submitting to demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, the public tribute to the US would be even more embarrassing.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its game well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that will trigger economic turmoil in one of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than we have previously observed,” said Abigail Grace, an American researcher who is focusing on Asia.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in an interview with the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation here is more stable and safer because of progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he does not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe confirms victory in the Ryder Cup tournament in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup tournament by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National golf course near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points, which they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who failed in most tournaments, fired his first shot into the water on the 16th hole with a pair of 3s and gave up his game in favor of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his laps and became one of four players to have played 5-0-0 since the tournament's inception in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth has eliminated the lowest-ranked player in the European team Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, beat 2 and 1 Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Veteran of the eight Ryder Cup tournaments, Spain’s Sergio Garcia, has become the European tournament winner with 25.5 points in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy that the cup is coming back.
It's about the team. I'm happy I could help," Garcia said, under the influence of emotions after the European victory.
He handed the relay over to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods through two holes at the remaining hole in the game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup tournament.
A special statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles in second place behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find the right path except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after an unsatisfactory performance before his team, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning, the time has come when the situation in Europe has become unpleasant.
We fought.
Hat down in front of Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
“We will re-establish a group, work with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Tournament Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I’m proud to have been a captain.
Hat's down.
You defeated us."
