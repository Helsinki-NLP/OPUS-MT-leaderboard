European inflation has slipped into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the dizzying rise in food prices.
The price increase in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording - after 2.6 per cent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent, the Luxembourg-based Statistical Office of the Union announced.
Official forecasts gave as likely as only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest rate, under the pretext that the decline, coupled with rising commodity prices and the reduction of forced unemployment, would provoke a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the trap of 22: "it has to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene later on on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke the record of twelve years; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation spiked in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat futures prices rose by 88 percent, and soybean prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching last month the black gold almost $ 100 per barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while by 2009 it will already fall to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months at around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double interest rates during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December support for the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup had never before experienced such a low level – 13 percent – in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe voters of the parties – due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters – would mean a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) versus a support of one-fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the limit necessary to have some parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is one two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
With regard to next year, the majority of the population is seeing the situation deteriorate and only one-tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the Prime Minister is performing poorly rather than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány a lot, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54 percent of the population do not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced towards the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 percent felt it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, today this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation answered that they would participate safely and another 20 percent said that they are likely to participate.
By comparison, only 55 percent of the population would participate in "a general election to be held this Sunday" and another 15 percent believes their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of paying tuition fees, 79 percent of medical consultations and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The Budaörs gold trading triangle hypermarkets maintained the average price level rise of 16 percent, with the difference that VAT has not increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also saw an average 16 percent increase in Budaörs’ gold trading triangle, Napi’s usual Christmas basket, but in all hypermarkets growth was well above HUF 1,000.
As in December last year prices in supermarkets had already “shooted”, so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers the fact that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below nine thousand HUF, today they can not do it even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003, that basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with a two-liter bottle cost less than HUF 200, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only HUF 257.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of last year’s most expensive basket with this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year’s average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during last year’s Christmas in prices there was an increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader misses the speed of circulation of a product, he may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only a 844 HUF.
Such extremes did not occur this year, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 percent increased the price of essential consumer goods.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the Central Statistical Office figures: this office, in the case of some basic foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent over the 12-month interval.
So, for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product, which was quite expensive last year compared to the base, there was, in the worst case, only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, suppliers of flour are in a stronger position than those of egg, being able to impose the dramatic increase in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets don’t complain about the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, most consumers of the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, carrying by pallets the preserved foods.
In the morning of Wednesday, the three stores formed large queues in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that domestic sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year, hospitals have reported several thousand infections caused primarily by the improper application of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the head of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
A wounded man in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after had to return to the hospital as a result of MRSA infection and since then it has not been possible to perform a major surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacterium in his body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, head of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been safely recorded in hospitals, and no information is available.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One-third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-produced infections (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is applied excessively or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, turn into highly resistant bacteria to antibiotics, and quickly become infected in inappropriate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicemia, primarily to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened organism, to the elderly or to people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the Hospital János there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are everyday in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, nurses serve them in rubber gloves and masks, and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment,” Nyulasi said.
Hospitalized patients are screened in advance for the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so infection cannot be prevented in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospitalized MRSA infections in most cases, but current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and transmission of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA in their bodies.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not fashionable.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to the public when MRSA infections already occur visible in the patient - said the doctor-head of the department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes rigorous commitments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for treating infections and pathological conditions.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be done to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of outpatients or in basic care," said Karolina Böröcz.
Saves with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare staff.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but also in this sense there are considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is contagious through droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, you can also experience - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favorable economic situation you save with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In Karolina Böröcz's opinion, where appropriate preventive measures are taken, there are fewer infections of this type or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is fought against in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the district police commander XXII has been made.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a stunned state could be ruled out by the then-retired commander of the XXII district police, who on Tuesday crashed and caused the death of a passer-by, said Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholemia that had already found that the former police commander did not drink alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII district police station, on Tuesday with his private vehicle bending to the street Kossuth Lajos of the XXII district, hit a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian zone.
(This last fact, i.e. that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way to bending.)
The transient lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said the former police commander had initially collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructures, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the grant of the cohesion funds, of which the parties had already previously signed a loan contract worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan contract is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million will be decided later, by extending the loan contract.
The parties signed a contract for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the University of Debrecen’s innovation and research project.
During the talks they also covered the topic of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will re-treat the issue of whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is in line with the EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, without charging a commission for keeping the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who buys in the even cheaper EU market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slope apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in the beaches of Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy properties in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Likewise, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a quick recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being an outstanding destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on Black Sea beaches and ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, in addition to them is important the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor.
They constitute the second category of buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in the month of December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group are real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly rising, as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, in the last five years they have experienced an annual increase of 21 percent.
The increase in the price of real estate far outweighs the growth in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at expert level will be concluded on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue negotiations at ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and policy makers from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap for post-emissions efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the particulars between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on precise figures at the moment, although it tends to agree that by 2020, compared to the 1990 situation, the emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for the effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The support fund, foreseen in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac est Profit".
Six percent of Hungary's
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Hydrology Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, irrespective of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to commit to reducing capacity even by 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to compromise their responsibility.
Gábor Fodor noted that the countries signatories to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states committed to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with - says the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
It is much what is at stake in Bali, since in two years the international IP will have to sign the international agreement of long-term climate policy, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of reduction of emissions that was associated with the CCC, its need for more scientific, and its
With this, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay and an increase of more than 2 ° C in the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, a fact that, according to scientists, would have irreversible and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
The units of the British Army in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general operations corps, then sent to London for upload to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers that have been uploaded to the Internet in this way and its "channel" has already been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of actions perpetrated in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Category: Operations in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to present to the public the true purpose of the British army’s presence abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs virtually nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example, about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, somewhat hypocritical, the officers talk about maximum losses, but do not present the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been uploaded to the Internet already numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with free downloadable shooter video games, called America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salted pie at the Christmas party of ministries
Labour minister Mónica Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to fire the year 2007 with salted cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for the Ministry workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, and for the Christmas of the Missionaries, the relatives of the soldiers currently serving missions abroad are invited, and a reception for the press will be offered.
This portfolio will allocate $25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious holiday with respect to the holidays of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the Casa del Futuro, with a total budget of HUF 4,320,000 and approximately three hundred and fifty of the ministry’s six hundred workers are expected to attend.
At the party of the portfolio, a Christmas atmosphere will reign, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola draw.
The ANF’s Christmas cost HUF 4,700,000 and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice Administration (CNAJ) building with music concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost HUF 1 million, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucia on December 7.
The CNAJ did not charge them anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s greetings and after dinner there was live dance music.
Answering the question of [origin] they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, work and local administration portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
Instead, Labour Minister Mónica Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a working end-of-year meeting.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will drink only coffee and salted cake, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai, will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - of this budget the reception will be paid with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon hours of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, in the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple reception standing, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a short greeting speech by the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments reported to [origin].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio they were not able to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that more than four hundred people were invited to the party that will be held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are coming together
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will form a strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's strike that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - unemployment will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway transit will be completely stopped and until 1 p.m. workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike, which they will hold jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Drivers will also be constituted, which will coordinate Monday’s actions.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, while on Monday, the participating unions will go on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
That is, that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on public health - did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for a strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly it is also possible that only vote on the law of public health at very early hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways it will stop working indefinitely, in the morning it may stop a part of the public transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the companies Volán.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for a definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are traveling on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m. workers of the Budapest Collective Transportation Company will be on strike, the Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike the League of Electrical and Thermal Industry Trade Unions 8 the Educators of the Electrical and Thermal Energy Unions 2 the Educators of the Educators and the
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will be on national strike at alternate times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS), which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, in the case of early retirement, the possibility that the occupations that deserve it may enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the sidelines of the railways and expects another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: Hungarian Guard increases risk in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
In the company's "warning on risks" is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They claimed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between gypsies and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international average, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of the stability and democratic development of the country".
We are reminded that from the autumn of 2006 onwards the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups of Hungary received increasing publicity and encouragement and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in the country that describe themselves as "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civilian organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, i.e. the state," they add.
They asserted: all this occurs in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and with political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
In recent months, in numerous neighbouring states, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a manner similar to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass riots of the Roma that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes which certain Gypsy Bulgarian organizations have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the Hungarian Gypsies react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, told the news agency: “Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence risk change, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their risk warning.
The party is not always written with red numbers.
In Hungary, the law precisely defines the days that are written in red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - which next year will be less - workdays are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, the holidays are not unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holidays, state holidays and public holidays.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter above all so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15, commemorating the revolution of 1848 and on October 23, commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1st the feast of labor, on November 1st and 2nd we commemorate our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day feasts Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it often becomes a bridge when before or after the holiday there is only one working day.
In exchange for the weekends so long, during the previous Saturdays you can not be absent from work or school.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when you have to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the feast.
This legal norm is compulsory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not compulsory, however, for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work uninterrupted even during holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country is practically stopped, since according to experience, most people "do bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The agenda will first be modified around the work party so that workers can then rest for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so in return Friday May 2 will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes during the holiday of the end of the year can rest, since from December 24 will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six small deterrents to bitter the lives of your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, audio messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass on to us without realizing: all of them are part of our everyday Folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to the little inconveniences or consciously avoid the confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
I'm sorry, I forgot to let you know you've been picked up by the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
Is that why you didn't go on a date?
At best, she feels it and tries to fix the issue, probably calling the marketing department to tell them that she forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time the issue is solved by apologies.
Before proceeding to lazy explanations, it is worthwhile to meditate on the things you can make your colleagues’ lives bitter and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than when you want to grab a document, an office utility, or your phone and you don’t find it.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Do not take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for stealing their things.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out of time.
Gossip about your colleagues' private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumours that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (suppositions) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Do not abuse the trust of your colleague when he shares with you his most intimate secrets!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others also know the things about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office on the phone and say you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or you feel that day you prefer to rest; think about what others have to do your work, your impossibly tasks, your work by term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you will have to stay at home, communicate to them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Tarareos, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are you suddenly getting rid of the laughter of your colleagues?
Have you involuntarily heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear it?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your tarareas, chants, conversations aloud (less when you do them above their heads), slanders, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent aloud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at this time in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something in time, you’ve forgotten to send an important letter or message!
Do not allude to the eventually reigning chaos in the office, nor to the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must correct the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your mistake!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be messy, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so demands!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning jam.
Sounds a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm raising the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national music life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks totally different this jam when you’re listening to Zagar’s new record.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although once again the rock style garage, breaking guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the ensemble that initially acted only in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national records, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of selling also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his set are fashionable, but no one has asked them if they wear this label or not.
The ensemble reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of Balázs Zságer’s ancient ensemble.
The reference about how airy, about flight, is fine, but in addition to the airyness of music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at Millenàris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real hit from the mr2 Petõfi channel that lately broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This broadcaster brought to the ears of radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balazs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: what is the music you are playing, to what extent is it dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed just for sale, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There, not only the fifteen and twenty-year-old generations attend concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the audience’s expectations, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works alone and did his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, trust the other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we embarked on another path.
hvg.hu: In mr2's list of hits Petõfi Wings of Love is in first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t intend to compose big hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heaviest songs.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of the good voice soloists of our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women – namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh – which was then baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly that way or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material from the record, we think that something is still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divas.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except for the short single by Judy Jay), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and not louder than the music, so the music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously didn’t want to distribute soloists’ roles.
The song is also about it, about forgetting for a while our ego, who came from where and where it is going, so let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have liked to have others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What did you do the most work on?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather when it comes to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, little by little, everything got in place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I’ve already “loosened” the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
An unfaithful mischief-maker.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
He long ago intuited, unlike all the major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, reveals, is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he said.
In the summer, he won <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million during the American crisis.
This opportunity has already seen it come at the beginning of the year.
In February, news began about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who had problems with payments in the past and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
“When I made my first $500 million, I didn’t know how to notify him,” Kerviel confesses, adding that nothing has been left to him at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery would not be made.
He even tricked the bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became a benefit.
Were you afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I’d made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, they’d be happy.”
Where did he get so much willpower to take that risk?
In my position it had to be worked gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was in the range of $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I knew I would never win as much as everyone else.
“In my first interview in 2005, I already noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel told the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares of Allianz, he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this meant a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew of all this or rather suspected it.
"While he was making money, they were closing their eyes."
Only then came the coup at the beginning of this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January I wanted to erase all traces.
When he got to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion to its fault.
And how did they manage to locate him?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
“I only chose four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his record,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of obtaining 365 billion
The Ministers of the Government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kronor).
This is nearly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion kronor will come out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transportation, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can get from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure, which next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion kronor.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and businesses for obtaining resources in business innovation.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly admitted countries that use them the least.
Twenty-year sentence for former Nicaraguan president, court orders
Nicaragua's Court of Appeals on Thursday decreed a 20-year sentence for former Nicaraguan president Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of a $100 billion (nearly 1.8 billion kronor) bailout.
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to go under house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, will be back in jail.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, will rather depend on the prison officers if they let the German end his sentence at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how German was constantly transferring government money to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to fund his campaign in the 2001 election.
This is how we approved the budget.
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential, quietly passed the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Every government begins and ends with every chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State Budgets of the last Social Democrat governments suffered from three defects that for this year 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of the presidents that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second of these is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the public funding deficit, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment other than money from taxes, fees and credits from banks, often issued, meaningless obligations with which they owed disproportionately to their municipalities.
In recent years they have been able to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that they received from the state and from privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we stick to only official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts.
This was the ideal opportunity for his government to put state finances in order.
However, instead, the state continued to indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programs are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been uselessly swollen with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon it does not change the retirement age and pension reform then it will be the real end of any policy in this country and, whoever governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money from retirement taxes and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget can’t be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the president’s expenses.
The planned deficit of more than $70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become just officials so we must be patient and give to this weak coalition of the government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and taxes, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be received in the Monetary Marking through tenders.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the US Fed will bid forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the 9/11 attacks, it is the first time central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report for customers.
“This coordinated action by central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what awaits them yet when they decided to take this step,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the global economy.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, London interbank rate used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the U.S., Canada and Britain central banks cut their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates," Tempus Consulting's Greg Salvaggio told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the move by central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists’ debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not green planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
“There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I only encounter the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now inform themselves about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly.
Furthermore, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against “reasonable environmental advocates but against environmental activists who do not take into account the cost-benefit relationship”.
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
Six hundred thousand drivers have passed the date and for this reason did not manage to change their old driver’s license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials give them time until the end of the year to issue the new pass.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid passport will find themselves on the roads.
According to traffic, the pass has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of passports, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and interest in the new passport has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 customers daily.
In the queues wait for half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet taken out the new passport.
The issuance of a new passport lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the passport within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their passport and do not reach the end of the year, but will go on the roads without a valid passport will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the violation with a warning.
In the event of an administrative breach, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to introduce moderate fines of at most a thousand crowns.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, the fine of a thousand crowns does not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving licence is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that every person should have valid.
People who do not want to drive should hand over the driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving licenses.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the passport issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence for Berdych's accomplices
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych, will spend between 13 and 10 years in prison.
The High Court in Prague decided as definitive deadline the reduction of the sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives in the Prague Department of Organized Crime were initially going to fall between the ages of 14 and 12.
The decision of today can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but the verdict of the Court of First Instance awaits him in the first place.
Despite this, in other trials he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the Superior Court, today, revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ allegations were dismissed by the investigation on the grounds that they were fabricated cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group avoid penalties.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The indictment relates to the criminal offences committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the theft, their victims suffered serious impacts on their health but they are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a gun permit.
In the home registry, police found guns, ammunition with a steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other trials, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have so far avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they are awaiting a final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change a child: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity home, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, does not agree in principle with Veleba’s proposal.
"We do not approve such a demand, it is too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
“For us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescissory value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostal said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>'s family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating the compensation of the specialist's report, only that it was drawn up at the hospital of the Motol faculty in Prague.
The girls’ parents, according to psychology and psychiatry specialists, suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was better endured by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women are getting worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba added.
Veronica and Nicola were replaced by nurses at the Maternity Home in T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermákov<0xC3><0xBD> and Przybyslavic, and Verónica to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
The governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, handed over 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation for the mistake made at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital that the region manages.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask for help from the administrator.
The court has so far granted them a proportionately low compensation, amounts that were calculated according to tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear in the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
“The lawsuit consists of Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team being parasites of Bolek Polivka’s popularity,” Polivka’s lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone gets the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We’ve had about ten years of work.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that for that reason I could also get something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the brand Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Polivka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
Then it was not about orienting him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> thought of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin resulted a lucrative business and business activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also determined that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Polivka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polivka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves entirely to it.
The collaboration, among the now decomposed parties, continued until the year 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Polivka the official coronation in Vsetin.
From that moment on, there began to be conflicts between Polivka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, the culmination of which came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the elect forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through the mediation of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> derived in the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková, as the queen mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his society, which has been rejected by the court to this day.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
From him should come the new king.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We are in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polivka can present himself," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I have never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic five-door Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer from the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the inside quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the design invention even though the car already looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the dimensions of the body have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned space shortage in the header disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This one should be rated as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear door) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the depot.
According to the tables, in the basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which in comparison with the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot is lagging behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when placing the child's stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the floor that is left quite flat after lowering the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with an injection ignition of four valves over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what a 1600 should look like that would underestimate the five-door family.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has impulse.
If I compare it with the time of the <0xC5><0xA1>dada of the time that it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, still can.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but count on the team’s add-ons at the Fabia and you’ll get a pretty similar number.
Now it remains to be decided which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools attend children from Eastern European countries and for this reason, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools register those cases where conflicts between migrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronchitis among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with insults of a racist tone.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls against a Slovak immigrant.
The girls harassed him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave, he made us want to throw apples and pears, and then he took off his pants and showed us his ass,” she told The Times, the student’s mother.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with eastern European migrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above show us how the atmosphere in English schools is starting to be quite tense.
In Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks enrolled who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He was commissioned to build one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything that was criminal in the U.S. (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings emerged, wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio the stars of the show and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of La Bodeguita Abanense you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already cult from the 1950s, until today they still operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have been oxidized among these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating considerably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the area as there.
Other places are metamorphosed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railroad lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the sugar factories by narrow tracks in steam or electric machines.
Their carmakers for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sibling models that are in other parts of the world can only be found in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous place for most visitors does not change.
And for that, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway hacienda there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone rock lands.
Mogotes, limestone pillars and rocks of high steep in the valley falls, and in their caves acclimatize fertile lands thanks to which rocks that hide dense vegetation are formed.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Havana cider factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that there was shot the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad and Tobago
A town of old abolengo that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so remote that even in the 1950s there was no road that connected it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth getting to know interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancon Beach or the sugar factory valley.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in the western end of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads arriving there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO due to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, pures, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, the Santería, the African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, of all of which many pages could be filled.
However, as they say, it is better to see it ever.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment is what is influencing the mission’s progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as expected, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban are growing, today the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase activity, Britain sees strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and the distribution of development aid as a priority.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development on their own,” Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to U.S. military data, Afghan rebel activity is higher than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
Among the attending countries in recent months, there has been controversy over whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the fighting demands there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist Sun newspaper this week called the German soldiers “vagos”.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans devote themselves to playing while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a footage accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph where the British troop played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt to reach 1 trillion in 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 crowns.
Total debt in September amounted to CZK 842.7 billion.
This year, the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
However, at the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kronor thanks to the improvement in the evolution of the economy from the state budget.
The Czech Republic's national debt grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion kronor.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion kronor.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the state in early October.
For each Czech, the debt amounts to 84,000 kronor.
Over the past year, the state was indebted with more than 111 million crowns.
“For now, it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year, we could cross the trillion-kroner border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900 billion and the trillion kronor,” David Marek, an economist at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora sees it: “We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But such a change I do not see," he added.
Doubt grows
State debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The government debt is paid out through treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or e.g. loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor.
Foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion kronor z since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kronor.
The average government debt maturity increased by 6.5 years.
“The year-on-year total debt from the first to third quarter created 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a reform of pensions," Pikora said.
Better Than Expected
The government’s payment and debt management strategy for 2007 suggests that the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kronor this year.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kronor thanks to the improvement in the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million kronor instead of the planned 91.3 billion kronor.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about CZK 13.3 billion, the reserve of CZK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, CZK 43 billion to finance state bonds and CZK 1.8 billion in payments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
I was comparing Khartoum in front of a court today for giving a name to a teddy bear.
The British professor tried in Sudan for insulting Islam has been sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting pupils ages 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was punishable by a whiplash.
This 54-year-old British school teacher based at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with assault on Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back in fact to the month of September, when this teacher asks her pupils, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohammed as their preferred name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a professor at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m sorry I’ve only asked the children to vote for a name,” according to him it’s just an “innocent mistake.”
Opinion divided by numerous pupils of the school teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her pupils" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohammed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the Prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo’s Serbs and Albanians finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was commissioned into a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, they insist on a pursuit of the negotiations beyond this peak date.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these "last-chance negotiations" were held.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his grief.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations".
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered a compromise always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
" For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible. "
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto right.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had declared.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush signs Israeli-Palestinian deal
President George W. Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he held Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do anything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides their obligations with regard to the peace route they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would seek to "conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including the core issues."
This designation covers the three main hairy issues of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and deepened” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
On his return to the podium, Olmert pledged to make the upcoming negotiations “direct and continuous” and to make “an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008.”
At the end of 2008, Bush put an end to the implementation of his " vision of two Palestinian and Israeli states " coexisting.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saoud estimates in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened, last Sunday?
As well as each time in this kind of events, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the General Inspection of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17:00, rue Luisa-Miguel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating headlight," a police source explains.
A Kawasaki-branded green motorcycle, "not approved, i.e. not authorized to circulate on public roads" (read below) and driven by two helmetless youths, circulated " at full gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the cede the step to the right," the police said.
The alcohol control exercised on the occupants of the vehicle proved negative.
The state of the car (the front folded, the windshield cracked, the bumper ripped off) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary homicide and denial of assistance " to the IGPN, co-conspirated with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d ' Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation, at this stadium, dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-bike arrived relatively quickly to his left".
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the feet on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in time for the police car to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor swiftly circulated around Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, thus rendering no relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also exclude " any serious misconduct " in this respect.
"It's the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, on which you have to be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness to these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely overlooks the scene.
"We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a completely frightened policeman, who was teasing.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youngsters, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that swiftly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that people were present from the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police marches".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that the police services did not bring assistance to the youth.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under the state of emergency have been wounded by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stones, injuring policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday gathered the support of religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “exhorted the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and the waste they swore to in front of Musharraf.”
" Musharraf's Promise Is No Longer Achieved "
The Pakistani Supreme Court directly refers to the derogatory measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the coming days on the legality of re-election in the presidential elections, on October 6, by indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "is no longer worthwhile" after the state of emergency was established, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed a better "dominance of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has gone from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, season considered the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular Repair on the Space Station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to effect the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable to the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "scaped" by astronauts to effect repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a thick cylindrical piece tasked with soon hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing gear for lab modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After displacing it, the crew began reorganizing the module’s solar panels that have a span of 76 meters.
And it is where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged in little more than a meter or less by a cable that snapped.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to make a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snail at the end of the 30 meters long remotely controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to effect the repair.
It is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Tall, resistant, very skillful, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been tasked with "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, he cut the failable cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker" who had stayed close to the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with an insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "scaped" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were taking advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for their scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in stock market
The EADS stock is currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% at 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its forecast of operating result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to mitigate the delay in delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, with no further encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS’s operating result failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to the delays of another program, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The election of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the start of the polls: the Russians are going to massively opt for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the election, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proves overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything become transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
It denounces a campaign strangled by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there has never been such a dirty election, even in Yeltsin’s time.
After the crackdown on demonstrations last weekend, former world champion Jack Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is banned from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel owners of their destiny," estimates sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov, of St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin restored the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic easing," estimates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " renounce personal responsibility " of those who had briefly given evidence after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) head the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of 54-year-old Tamara Cherednitchenko: "Why reflect?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not yet accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or their rightholders.
The eleven States in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective from yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searches to be made " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced labour ", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to the opening to the public of these nominative documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain deportation victims.
The records of concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find the countrymen deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, eventually, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents,” Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Center on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin, said in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches around 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The Foreign Ministers of the European Union had last April given their approval to the European Commission to start negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will dopage both economies a lot," and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten European products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services ", had declared this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation to India in New Delhi.

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about relieving the current turn of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds to the base index of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period starting on 6 December " , the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the period of maintenance starting on 6 December.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time that England BoE has put liquidity in the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is " prepared to take further steps to maintain " interbank loan rates up-to-date in line with its baseline index.
The interbank rate per day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny review of PS party’s proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the 50% increase of the surplus for employment, the re-establishment of the TIPP (inland rate for oil products) floating, a check-transport or restrictions on rents.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more and no less, the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival would take place from August 8 to 10 on a private 500-acre farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now host up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s work in parallel to give the region a festival-event of European style.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as the marketplace and worked with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
“Unfortunately, we’re stuck in low-level policies because of the current administration,” says Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional location that has lately taken place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after being demarcated in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are done rather in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of a country festival in the European and urban way in the American way.”
Vineland is more or less halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow you to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer for this festival is “very large,” like the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find the conditions in Montreal favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are going to judge the best,” he says.
The race to the festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is still the promotion of the film from here.
The race to the Oscars has begun.
All West Coast festivals, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them value and ensure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally on the stock market? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to say goodbye to the close of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end of the year rally to arrive.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, especially because in the current context, uncertainties lie in the markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not in favour of the stock market taking a toll in the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the fugue effect towards quality values both in the long and short segments".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will be rather lateral, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the risk of stimulus from inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost nearly 4% since the November 8 highs when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Oluca, an analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US in terms of the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree when it comes to choosing the values that will be in charge of leading the Ibex towards new maximum quotas.
Intermoney’s Solana says “this year is about big values.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some builders “because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive.”
Meanwhile, Federico Oluca, of Inversis Banco, assures that the increases will come from the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they give up.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow suit,” the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bearish month on only two occasions.
The real end-of-year rally took place in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the tech bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a 6.68% rise.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to make the jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that supports the trading schedules.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capturing private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
For this purpose, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedule is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although if a greater hiring of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the World Credit brand, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax premises they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've got it."
With that phrase yesterday expressed his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he found that the chain that runs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect blurred his joy: 'it's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've gone down less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, "we have fallen less."
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That profit puts your loss at what we have for the year at 15.66%.
The stock value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday ceded 1.52% and accumulates a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (Five Days publisher) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year’s first television channel to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenue, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
If this figure were to become real, the TV channel would register this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antena 3’s net revenue increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while TV’s net revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Telecinco’s stock exchange is the high payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría shared 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in partnership with its parent Mediaset.
"We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol’.
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently cut its profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
It is because, they explain, it has cut the expected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3’s earnings forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force November 1
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by Congress of the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim that both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of entities for markets to function efficiently.
The MIFID, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow the provision of financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory societies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that the regulated secondary markets are added to the multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with the current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment service companies to disclose in the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all operations they perform, in order to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage by the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments were incorporated, among which it highlights that the securitized debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the debt of US high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that can be performed by graduates in Economics and Business 30 years after the real decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was approved in 1977.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI rises five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a breakthrough of how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily coincide with the definitive data, which will be released on December 14.
“The CPI will continue at relatively high levels.”
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the rise of 4.1% of the IPC in November was a “temporary figure”, but at the same time he announced that the price index will continue at “relatively high” levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not count on such a high rise.
“We expected a figure of around 4%,” the Minister of Economy acknowledged with regard to the figure advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it was amassing record deposits of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money offered by the government and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue from British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as its favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Detained the mayor of Totana for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained the current mayor of the Murcia municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo last May replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councillor of the municipality, and that according to sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The agents continue to register the municipal units and the council of Urbanism and no more arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER Chain reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore afore-mentioned, was stopped leaving Morales's home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the PSOE list for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be President of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced in a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that he has held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the Socialist group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change in the university sphere.
The former minister has acknowledged that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, just as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or shouting" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it unfortunately seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and quietly is the Congress, the president of the government was interrupted on some occasion in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good deed" and has not wanted to be already taking his place in order not to fall into what, he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change subjects both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to ruthless persecution, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is the president of the government as Zapatero and believes that that fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach forces him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain’s leadership of the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why its government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it demands that he explain to the Spaniards with the utmost clarity what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens’ habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have not been, nor will there be, such explanations.
It’s because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the fuel suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not want us to ride a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana detained for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The edil was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose units he is currently with numerous agents, who have also visited the Department of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests add to the six carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not detained but are indicted in the summary, which is instructed by the No. 1 Court of Totana.
The first six detainees have gone to court today.
According to sources, the former mayor of Totana and today autonomous MP of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Soil of Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, through which the bribes would have been carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, namely the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
Grupo Nuaria integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the car parks of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the sector of direct marketing; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things that happen
Article 3
If they think so, we will leave the Book of the Month to rest, to see if in the meantime we have another ‘premiology’ and other competencies.
I'm already figuring something out.
Life is change, folks.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.
Article 2
Our Finnish correspondent gives us this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way, head of the PISA report on education level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn’s book:
“The content of the Philosophy signature has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of death, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Councilor of Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.
Article 3
A colleague gives information on the introduction of Internet download offences into the Penal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime with a sentence of six months to one year.
Instead, if you steal in the store discs worth less than 400 euros, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal in the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than that imposed on the download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than that of the discharge (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous squabble has a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, someone's hand is going away, a very long hand.
Article 4
My senior doctor gives me one of his articles on rare research titled, “Money produces brain activation, especially if others receive less.”
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly wages of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study has been conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if both hit the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was higher.
I don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main culprits in the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Its names are on that list from which takes its title the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'Carla's List' (2006, not premiered in Spain) which, at the pace of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to stress them.
What kind of insurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in case of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the passport, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being held responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of an accident.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the passport, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the more likely you are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
It is for this reason that both older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as the statistics reflect that they have a lower sinister rate due to their prudence.
In addition, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the likelihood of having some kind of impact.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That’s why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, it offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various inconveniences when hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the passport.
Although the ideal thing to be well insured is full risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
Most cautious drivers can opt for a full-risk franchise, so they get the coverage of full-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would mean that the customer would pay a portion of the amount of the damage.
"The part of the amount of the damage that the customer contributes will be preset based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, senior manager in Spain at First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer is guaranteed protection against damage caused to third parties, but not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be careful and avoid damages as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, reducing the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate held by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on such a base rate.
“The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year, you can afford to increase the bonuses," Noguera explains.
After the age of 25, drivers find it easier to take out insurance, as the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to contract a full risk with franchise.
"Normally, young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired in the event of an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the newcomer' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children it is preferable to negotiate full-risk insurance, as long as their financial situation allows it, of course.
Marriages with children are considered by the insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with a franchise (which can be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise,” said Luis Noguera.
For retirees, a full-risk insurance with a franchise (being this one of 150 euros), or one extended to third parties when you have a high level of bonus is recommended.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in case of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic seeks a point worth the eighth in Milan
Milan and Celtic are on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to reach their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to judge their qualification.
The Italians add up to ten points and have already certified their pass in the fifth day with a tie in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but still need another to make sure that Shakhtar, with six, and he receives Benfica, which has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, as Milan have to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on day 13 in the semi-finals in search of a place for the final of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan could even serve a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar doesn’t win, but he can’t be trusted because at nine-point tie the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the night to the Scots, who hope to get in eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were defeated in that round last season with a goal from Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the one-way.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who only deserves the triumph, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into the eighth and to stay in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which would play UEFA.
20,000 People Attend Vancouver’s First Spice Girls Tour Concert
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared that the group's reunion was "brilliant" shortly before they started their concert at Vancouver's GM Place.
About 20,000 people ran out of tickets to watch the concert, which included a video that tells the story of the group that made fury in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects his main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five Spice Girls went on stage wearing bracelets given to them by Posh Spice's husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowded audience at GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had banned him days before.
In the preview of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "hasn't seen our outfit at all, so I'm nervous about what she's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice', whose departure from the group in 1998 'because of the differences between us' caused the quintet to dissolve two years later, also expressed her nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been sorted out and we love all of us very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nanny girls awaited them.
Among the five, there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every rubbing between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge more to Ukraine, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40 percent more for Gazprom’s imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“Change in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about transit rates levels [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS “must test foreign workers”
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor criminal records of employees outside Europe, a watchdog said.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after it was verified that a foreign doctor was related to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign personnel it has.
However, his report pointed out other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the amount of foreign personnel hired outside the European Economic Area, following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after colliding with a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who acted at Old Bailey by video conferencing in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
The NHS hopes to conduct pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although Scotland’s health board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report recommends, among other measures, that the boards should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal checks in many countries outside Britain.
“Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign personnel.”
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checks work at NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say there are currently 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying employees with indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being complied with widely.
This includes passport controls, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the foreigners’ pre-employment policy and guide in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I had a great interest in this work being carried out in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in updating the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the biographical film about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Best Picture Award.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond protagonist Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, featuring soundtracks from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was produced for just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards – Best Director and Best Debutant Director.
Rock music was the centerpiece of another award-winning ceremony—like Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, which won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a London Russian Mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s film Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, a star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning the smuggling of missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have been campaigning against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the report said.
Saudi Arabia has created a 35,000-strong force to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, following a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 detainees were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining as al-Qaeda militants to fight Allied forces and back the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants target many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants — recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government — targeted government-associated foreign residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
The arrests also include a “media cell” of 16 people in Medina, whose goal was to promote “takfiri thought” – the radical Sunni Muslim ideology that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes another 32 people accused of providing financial support and support to the militants.
Venus' climate may give an idea of Earth's future
Venus may once have been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
The data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to the weather.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, says: “It is becoming clear why the weather on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police seize "enriched uranium"
A kilogram of radioactive material, which they say is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
It is still open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the Republican Party debate on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party in the run-up to next year’s elections.
It is not known exactly how the CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show the candidates to the nominees.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to pick up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest exchanges of words of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
None has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, coupled with fear of China’s toxic toys and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned into awkward when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble upon the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now, against all expectations, first in the latest Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, coincidentally with the fundraising campaigns of liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America’s greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Laboristas
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
They do not appear to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel bills in Paris, nor sucked out of extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour government party, worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using fake names, and that the party did not denounce him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister circumvented calling for an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The bailout of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and judgmental poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative mess.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they are unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their unbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press seeks bad news; and the government takes the defensive and does not focus.
On one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax, are related to the decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even when it’s not directly involved in Blairish’s setbacks — or “cash for partners,” political party funding research — voters can assume it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been scammed directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not up to him.
The anti-anonymity laws for big political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham’s agreement, and that he was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser chief who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half the job.
He has been quick to convict his party of breaking the law, but he is diluted in decision-making by a family affair, a commission of inquiry into the matter – largely led by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, as he has not had one in six months, and he must also press for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require laborious cooperative work by the Labour Party with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the unions – bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and strong competition.
Sharks Cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins swim around excitedly.
Today, with the American housing market in crisis, predators have their eyes set on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million overs in its U.S. consumer finance business, partly due to the weakness of cardholders.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. People Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore in arrears) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debt consumers pay each month.
And the confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty strong, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts emissions by 2007 will be nearly 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection from the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiration.
But credit card issuers look more at liquidity flows than assets, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in lenders’ creditworthiness.
They may even work to outsmart broadcasters.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decline if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, card debt repayment rises on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders face by changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a contraction in credit is pushing America into recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility in the frauds with the former head of Enron’s financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven charges of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to get rich at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a famous cause in Britain for extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the 2001 Enron crash.
Initially, charges against the bankers were alleged to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s fall.
The indictment against the bankers - it doubled the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the creator of a myriad of frauds at Enron, which helped its spiral of bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interests at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the bank’s interest from the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest on the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the $20 million was left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the Enron collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of tricks in accounting, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses seem successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were charged last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
“But nobody asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire’s Fair, a four-day orgy of consumption held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from handmade mahogany yachts to diamond-embedded car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer cautiously looks at a bright orange Porsche on the stand next to his."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets."
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to gather in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s biggest consumers and spenders.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian billionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the group Soho Jewelry.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit she wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum feathers, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy 30-euro ($44.57) tickets.
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of Dutch royal porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the bling-bling.
In fact, sellers said the wealthy Russians of more track record (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from eye-catching logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be on display at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people – cash millionaires, millionaire emissaries or tourists – fill the hallways every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grills to Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded in Swarovski crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars."
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase “Russian billionaire” does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if you’re not in cash,” he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with one-million-dollar counterfeit banknote batteries.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire’s Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” says Karryev.
“Scape” Surgery Could Cause Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the "A Little Healthier" restaurant and saw how an ambulance climbed over White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance come up," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant's supervisor, that day Wednesday.
"That's when I found out someone was dead."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark police department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the house at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for the toxicology test, although the results will not be available until a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death she has mourned to the upper ranks of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” Mr. McCarthy said about Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and who left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the County Union Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about his investigation or about the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door in Mrs. Castro’s home, where a rotten rosewood is located in the front of the house, and a dalmatian thief in the back.
A blue drum labeled as "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was on the door of the carport, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang on hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rude political culture.
"She would say, 'You have to watch with this one or that one,'" he said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock market
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were boosted by reassuring comments from the U.S. central bank vice president.
The stock exchanges loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Ben Bernanke’s number two chairman Donald Kohn declared that policymakers must be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to continued tensions in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid rising samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was “partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and through October.”
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales hitting the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at close to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the reappearance of credit tension in the markets was highlighted after strong demand for three-month-old funds from the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks to be 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Federal Reserve and the ECB’s performance and inject extra funds into London’s stock markets tensioned credit and three-month “Libor” lending rates among British banks, marking the biggest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England takes lawsuits against Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas here, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and furthermore because Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill the desk with bids to become a national part, and if not a team, one.
The one who doesn’t get the sixth place in batting will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport as well.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes out of lack of luck rather than capacity.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, as it requires judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, were to be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do they have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time taking a wicket and a batter to get opportunities to change order if he wants to make an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who plays for sure in the first round even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races each to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more from these.
The games of Shah or Bopara at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a major player, and despite scoring a hundred doubles against Australia in Australia, can still be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion at today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over young Bopara’s exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent track record against spin bowling.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two turns in May against West Indies in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, seeming to have taken from his "batting" something of an elan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has the joy of living on swords.
He got caught up in the cricket field for nothing and his attitude was summed up as when he threw his vehicle at an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at the distance, to tell him with excitement, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn’t mean that Shah doesn’t stand out, as tea leaves suggest, he’s playing here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work – and Fight Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who were waiting for the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and what is safe now.”
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shi'ite militia of religious militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary ceasefire.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with her two sons because it was impossible to renew her visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in her country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped pull al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades.”
“That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops strengthened groups of “worried citizens,” armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned for visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees’ visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death gangs.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tensions.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will resurface sectarian tensions and start the struggle.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, Sarlanders lack only an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlandais that we are not French" - that was the ironic motto about themselves of the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which ranked fifth in a study by the Institute of German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor".
Thus, by tradition, high schools have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students coming from the Saarland is higher than the average in high schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
"The Saarland vocational education system is exploited," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than one in five young people graduate from the vocational school, and the Saarland is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in terms of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to make more publicity for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we have been making some reforms in general education schools," a Ministry of Education spokeswoman said.
Thus, the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
In order for children to start as soon as possible to study the final year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", this has no cost. Meanwhile, this model is also imitated by the other federal states.
The comparison with the upcoming studies will show if the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of pupils behind in school development decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But, in general, the Saarland did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the disgust of the Sarlians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarlands are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chávez changed the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the time change in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Chávez is now a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the hour will pass to less than four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would in its day impose an obligation on the world by changing one full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time), Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighbor Colombia due to the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil-rich country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, his power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chávez said criticizing the decision Uribe made had offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chavez.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: “Why don’t you shut up?”, is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who felt annoyed by the continued interruptions by leftist populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, a decline in real wages this year threatens German employees despite a strong economic outlook.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to calculations by the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees are expected to have a lower real salary account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault of that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research on Economic Cycles told Bild newspaper.
The new burdens of unemployment insurance may also correspond to the employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% over the course of a year, is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the Labour Office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, it was revealed that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food and oil derivatives sector reached the highest level in 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not been proposed until now. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and whirlwinds at the poles, the same that appear also in winter on Earth.
For the past three decades, researchers have suspected that there could be rays on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, rays are silent from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous Urey-Miller life origin model, rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it's not like that: if there was ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500°C reign on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Possibly, Venus is a "diabolical" twin from Earth, but it remains a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since since the 1990s there have been no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of research that will be presented in many "Nature" articles, in the opinion of the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more characteristics in common with Earth than we had previously assumed," ESA said in a statement.
Despite the well-known stormy winds in the North Pole, the researchers also discovered in the southern polar region a vortex formed by the clouds that spins faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the Earth’s poles, as described by a team of Giuseppe Piccioni researchers from the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet is also called a dawn star or evening star orbiting the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus, with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bar, does not resemble Earth much, scientists assume that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets, water had agglomerated that remained on Earth in the oceans, but on Venus it was dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Federal President Horst Koehler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the "Handelsblatt".
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
“Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute validity to me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when pursuing a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not take a distance from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows it too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused major misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the religious leader from the Tibetans in their official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama demonstrated that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with the police on the streets, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
Barricades were made, the vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious riots starring young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We must also make sure that our country’s social problems do not take the form of violence.”
“We have to take that seriously,” he said in the newspaper Neue Presse, published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop into the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits."
It is still too early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The youths starred in serious street riots with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
The President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of an imitative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Despite all this, actions are necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 was above average.
We need to ensure that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: “We have to give young people a perspective.”
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
"Young people should be given the opportunity to get a job or vocational training job faster."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses flew over the territory.
The authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and cars burned.
Since the previous day, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been dealing with security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of the Interior, announced that the police will take rigorous measures until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, about 80 police officers were wounded by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began with a car crash on Sunday, killing two young people.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the youth was not the fault of the police.
In the realm of Angela Wolke.
The performance far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, demonstrates that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more is to be expected from it.
But in what country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that should be governed by her.
Regarding the reproach that was made to her for repeatedly dedicating herself to acting in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed he made it clear that he does not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Lower House, it was very clearly stated to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
There could be no slight interest or any kind of feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that flees into foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself – for two years the head of the Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
It’s about expressing yourself so that people get an impulse.
And so it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke the inner problems are seemingly of little value.
Child poverty and concerns about low-wage workers?
The only thing he dedicates himself to is to talk about that subject using subordinate sentences.
It’s amazing how many times you’re wrong when it comes to talking about the supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble “as if it had been in an unknown territory,” when it was more concrete information.
The Attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a clash in a heated debate over YouTube's Republican presidential pre-candidates and now must fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates are evident from the outset.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into “a refuge for illegal immigrants.”
"I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals," Giuliani responded to the former governor of Massachusetts saying he was the one who employed the undocumented illegal immigrants.
Candidates tend to attack: as the Republican group has so far had no clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were uploaded to Youtube, don’t have much content either.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” that was John McCain’s reproach to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from Vietnam war veterans, when he refuses to recognize as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
The public’s reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that meanwhile the campaign’s most important themes are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, apologising to the people and the television audience for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf ruled without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is how the eight years of military rule in Pakistan ended.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf took an oath on Thursday for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his command of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he took power with a bloodless military coup, the former general governs the state as a civilian chief for the first time.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state’s attorney general, after the Musharraf oath will soon annul the state of emergency and meet the second condition of the West.
Since the state of emergency was proclaimed in the Supreme Court, there have been many supporters of Musharraf, and last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release, a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written at the band's best time.
Already at that time they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has their box, their cables and above all their buttons in front of them.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the Harmonia band was making music again.
What must be rebelled here is the following: the exact questions have shown that the name of the band resonated in the minds of the people, but it was not something so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the seventies?
Especially because the Krautrock misconception was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of the Cologne-based Can 2003 band for their life work, in the room you could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time did not achieve a great effect on the audience, however, it was later obtained thanks to the others.
Some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the sixteenth century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist’s life full of surprises.
It is said that one day an Ottenstein Harmony singing association flag appeared in the garbage, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in using the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Some remember that, in this recording almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do occasional rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up meddling in esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since then has had more success than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Greenland set itself the goal of cultivating this German contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, the band Neu! was rediscovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all Krautrock's influences on the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase accompanied by the special music fills the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos showing Harmony with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in the black and white photo projections, where you can see instruments with cables.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and the battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatus they had built with their own hands.
Nowadays, electronic music is what it should be.
Three people who dig deeper into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere he coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis he sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been an English term.
It was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "68!" here is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
On the stage he reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does music start and where does it end?
That can break one’s nerves or give you quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only needs more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two did not have much conviction.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot in actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the Balkan Mountains, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere was rediscovered.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and insignificant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to perhaps watch the film "The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles today have to be so long and silly?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decadence preserved most of his now.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbia from the snipers of Kosovo, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm be Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there really never was a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another screenwriter (Richard Shepard in two charges), the story about American reporters in the war going to detect a war criminal Serb called "fox", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go to the mountain twice to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time it becomes a trip insane.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first we are introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be simply a cynical with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Bosnian Muslim who will be killed later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters of the world, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to a just revenge.
It is so bad, that they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not just the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
He recently published in a newspaper that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
It’s almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or into the minefields, then something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arguette appears, “Beyond All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Bloody Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It has to be at least decades before Hollywood rolls a good movie about the Holocaust with the movie "Schindler's List" as an example.
Some films need more time. Classics such as the works about the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because writers don’t have the slightest fixation (which is necessary to be able) on telling good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don’t have to be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
The big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust received negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms from politics and the economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director-general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday the resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In recent times, no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, the political, sporting momentum could not be kept at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
“Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but the German Olympic Sports Federation decides,” von Beust says in the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich’s application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance.”
Despite all this, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics.
"It's too early to let go of the opportunity, if at this point the plans are ruined," Günter Ploß, the director of HSB, said Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German public high school sports federation (adh).
There von Beust referred to Hamburg's 2015 application for universities not as a "substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Higher School Sports Federation appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) blamed the Senate for not taking advantage of such valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was delaying the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who links the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Bright-Boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" international art put in doubt the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Moderna Museet museum in Stockholm carried out internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which are also the "Brillo-Boxes", that the ex-director of the Muséo de Pontus Reguen
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Bright-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that had cartons of "Bright" soap powder.
According to Warhol, at the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet were exhibited hundreds of Gloss-carton boxes. These were not made by Warhol (due to expenses), but were brought directly from the "Bright" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production of wooden crates in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as originals of the "Bright Boxes" of "type Stockholm" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions, some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him were produced and exposed.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already been dead for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservators of the Moderna Museet Museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First, their squeezed silvers were printed and grinded and then painted in oil with a brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed silvers. In addition, it is not about oil painting, but about acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Bright-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Moderna Museet's ex-copies will be categorized as these.
Already in July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious allegations" that they are soap dust boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered who had lodged in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Head Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been entangled in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial on Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so he could suddenly stand with some 30 supporters.
Evidently the military police who were to watch him had passed in his ranks and followed his uprising.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Hotel Noble.
The president called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
"People are tired," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to come to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to continue the march.
Major government critics called on Thursday for a major rally against the president.
For months, his government has been blamed for corruption.
In 2003, the financial district in Manila was a site that drew all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution holds the equity for a third party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day made share with nearly 10 percent of the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital expansion measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on marketing cooperations for DSL-products.
“We are strengthening our collaboration,” the United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the outset, the two companies want to be satisfied with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e. they make Freenet participate 18.49 percent.
This meant that both companies retained all options, especially participation in the Freenet joint stock company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far, the United Internet and Drillisch holdings directly held 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
