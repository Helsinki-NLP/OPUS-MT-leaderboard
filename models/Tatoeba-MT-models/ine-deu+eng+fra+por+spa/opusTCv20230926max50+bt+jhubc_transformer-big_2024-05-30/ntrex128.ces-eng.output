Members of the Welsh Assembly fear they will “look like Muppets”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are consternated by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The proposal is based on plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group feared it was "rhyming with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member of Plaid said the group as a whole was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh conservative said his group was approaching the change of name "with an open mind", but noted that the MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision as to how the members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will of course be on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, where a variant called the Welsh Parliament Assembly received broad support.
As for the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the Assembly are apparently proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus may be of concern to President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules for disqualification of members and a proposal for a committee system.
The members of the Assembly will vote on the question of their title in the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians will vote to change country’s name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
A multi-party vote should resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athenians have long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory, and have repeatedly protested against the country’s requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would not follow the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that changing the name is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silenced as the churches in Harlem fight for survival
“The old people I’ve talked to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
"There's not one today."
The disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People are dating in a different way today,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
As he adds, the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of this type of people, which will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood much.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and therefore the day will soon come when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches.”
Both churches built white congregations even before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose devotions were held nearby.
St. Martin was taken over by the Black Congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered a bell.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert, who played outside in July, called it a "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first outside bell in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger outside bell in the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin has had a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom have been summoned by secular church leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
In July, the Council of Elders – the leading body of the parish, consisting of lay representatives – sent a letter to the diocese, in which he expressed concern that the diocese would “try to pass the costs” on to the council of elders, although the recruitment of architects and builders sent by the diocese did not take place.
Some parishioners complained of insufficient transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy who sank for lobsters in California
According to the official report, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then paddled to him with the whole group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially considered the call to be the joy of catching lobster, but then “you realized he was yelling, ‘Kiss me!
He bit me!’”
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that "he had the whole area of the key bone torn."
“I shouted, ‘Let everyone out of the water, there’s a shark in the water!’
The boy was transported in critical condition by helicopter to the Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Sailor Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been seen in the area for several weeks, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities shut down the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to stand up to the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains through the shopping-house-style cosmetic alleyways, where specialized salespeople will be available.
As part of the strong entry into the UK cosmetics market, which is valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, cosmetics lanes will be tested in 11 stores across the country. If successful, it will expand to other stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to the effort of supermarkets to find use for shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products and will also introduce brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space thanks to brand locations similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also releasing its Boutique makeup range, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will test the concessions of the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop. The first such store was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the next one will be created in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift towards daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says that stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl with better service offerings and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened hundreds of Argos branch stores and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are the chains it bought two years ago. This has increased food sales and acquisitions are thus even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to remodel the department with a cosmetics and pharmacy assortment ended in disgrace.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds chain of pharmacies.
Lloyds plans to play its part by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands to the four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s chief commercial officer Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We’ve changed the look and style of the beauty lanes to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to work.
Our range of brands should meet all needs and the attractive environment and the convenient location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones Is 'Angry' After Holly Willoughby Dropped Out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
"Dragons Day" star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from a $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's homewear and accessories brand.
The couple's business was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old show host announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Day star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones was “furious” when a TV star admitted at a tense Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of homemade clothing and clothing.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was able to double the wealth of Willoughby's moderator at an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK for one of her summer homes.
An unnamed source said: “The Truly brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would secure her for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was shocking to all involved.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was happening, the launch was so close.
The Marlow Headquarters has a full warehouse of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions due to the heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and the possible further delay in launching the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Tara Capp in 2016 and in March, the 52-year-old Jones joined the board of directors.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones holds a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become M&S' ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin in I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult actions “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would get from journalists for a remark that some considered “unworthy of the president” and how positively he spoke about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “voting” voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their first June meeting in Singapore praised Trump as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the talks on the elimination of nuclear weapons are stuck at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “correct response” from the U.S. to its first steps toward disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
His efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – the end of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages, and the return of the remnants of U.S. troops to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena from outside, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami wave and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been driven from their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit of a challenge,” Sumbung says.
While Save the Children brings together a team that travels to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Paul to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for Mother Nature’s wrath.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but this is not at all common on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Paul before the tsunami probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even though the warning was issued.
Even at the best of times, traveling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in the case of natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
A hospital ship that moored in Lombok and helped the victims of the earthquake is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was the main focus of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
He will seek re-election next year, but his government is suffering from funding gaps.
President Joko also faces pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopt a more conservative form of faith.
Street fights between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and evicted tens of thousands from their homes.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute in London's Stamford Bridge on Saturday, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got his pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters ahead of Chelsea's gate when his team lost 1-0.
He threw the ball to the left and shot to a distant pole.
The bullet flew high and headed towards the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually jumped over the bouncing Kep Arrizabalag and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as much forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching me, so I didn't think much about it, and I fired at one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 after Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward sent the passport back to Mate Kovacic, then turned in the middle of the field and sprinted to half of Liverpool.
The forging ball quickly came in.
Then he sent the ball through Hazard's beautiful alley into limestone.
He escaped the defense and ended up with a left to a distant pole next to Liverpool's Alison Becker.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will face a local team in the Champions League group at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The Indonesian disaster agency said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami waves had risen to 832.
A 7.5-degree earthquake struck Friday, triggering waves of up to 6 meters in height and trapped many people in the debris of collapsed buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugro's office spokesman said at a press conference.
The city of Paul, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, has been plagued with ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and the police immediately launched an investigation into the murder.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is only just beginning, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was moving near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something, to contact us as they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the scene of the crime, who think they know the woman, to ask where she was found in the morning.
Police said an investigation is underway and they are now informing the victims.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
Residents have now learned that it will take several hours for them to be able to return home.
One man was told by a police officer that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He keeps saying, “That’s terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were behind the tape, and another was waiting outside.
In the enclosed area there are a number of police officers who monitor the house.
Anyone who has any information can send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has recently become a hit due to a dispute over "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a deserved punishment for his fanatic Puritan-style followers destroying many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “foolishness” and “an effort to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was imperative that Oliver Cromwell’s figure in front of Westminster Palace be one of the targets.
Cromwell did not order or perform iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of a 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a character that many think still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, though a little less than at the end of the 19th century, a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case of course from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of relentless historical debates.
Certainly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure who represents one side of this divide.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.”
Killing pig tore up a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig farmer was attacked and killed in a market in southeast China.
As the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, a man with only the surname "Yuan" was found dead with a cut artery in a blood vessel near a market in Liu-pchan-sui in the province of Kuej-chou.
A pig farmer is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in the town of Si-ning in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
On Wednesday, he and his cousin from the adjacent province of Jün-nan came to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next crib open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the manger with a mouth full of blood.
According to information, a forensic examination confirmed that a 250-kilogram pork ripped the farmer.
“The brother had his legs all bloody and torn,” the Guiyang Evening News newspaper quoted a cousin as saying he was nicknamed “Wu.”
The footage from the security camera shows Yuan coming to the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was closed so that no one else would be attacked when police at the scene were gathering evidence.
Market officials are allegedly negotiating with Yuan's family to compensate him for his death.
Pig attacks on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and critically wounded the man.
A decade ago, a Welsh farmer was shoved to a tractor by a pig weighing 300 kg, and the farmer’s wife drove him away.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They're curious. They don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken and move above the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, flooding will bring rain to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, representing Hurricane Category 1, and was located 620 km southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure rift forms above the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the U.S. west coast. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical moisture north to the southwestern part of the U.S.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity, with the approaching low-pressure rift, will cause heavy rain in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Precipitations of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous floods, suture streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern U.S., especially above most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, flooding may occur due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall.
Given the danger of tropical rainfall, it would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to become furious rivers, and storms bring locally shocking winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure ridge will bring heavy local precipitation on some parts of the southern California coastline.
Total precipitation above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller streams of dirt and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, some tropical storms will begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and Tuesdays, rain will spread.
On Tuesday it will be rainy throughout the day and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic begins to cool, but the tropical zone will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to sudden temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the United States on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will again try to expand the indulgent summer heat.
Most areas in the middle and east of the United States are expected to warm in early October with temperatures around 27°C from the southern plains to part of the northeastern United States.
In New York City on Tuesday it could be 27 °C, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday's seductive statements of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political backlash continued, and voters interrupted regular programs with reports of a sudden Friday turnaround: an agreement mediated by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had drunk her at a high school party and tried to strip her off.
Kavanaugh said in his enthusiastic statement that he was 100% sure that it hadn’t happened.
It is likely that the event was followed by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company counted average attendance on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations that broadcast the statements, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who watch in the offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in the play-offs or awarding Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest attendance of all stations, with an average of 5.69 million viewers following him during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest persisted even after the end of the negotiations.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught protesters yelling at him as he was about to take the elevator to the courthouse.
CNN was live broadcasting how he stood for a few minutes with his eyes closed and made himself gossip.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He also said, “You have power, but many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and even before the elevator doors closed, he added that he would say more at the committee's meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the Judiciary Commission was to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination for a vote in the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the accusation against the candidate is investigated by the FBI by next week, as demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After interviewing Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s vote was important because it was clear that without an investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politicians' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “politicising” Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close to that with the prime minister on the front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal to have Britain and the EU collect each other’s tariffs is “absolutely nonsense.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspicious of LSU Player Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge police department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses in the match.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, police secured the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to police, Simpson confessed to shooting Wayde after being interrogated.
According to the lawyer, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana Refugee Police Unit, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local police officers for “the pain and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-meter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU,
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde’s death “shook” and “shocked” him.
"That's what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano pulls ashes on Mexico City
The ash rolling from the Popacatépetl volcano hit the southern district of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the volcano's activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched a series of rumblings and shocks.
On social media, images of windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash appeared in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a strength of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police and thousands of people took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
The police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and dust paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually flooded by tourists.
Later, there were also clashes, for which the police had to use slingshots to calm them.
For hours, independent groups sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of protesting Union supporters who shouted "Long live Spain".
According to local media, fourteen people were injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low because secessionists boycotted them.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting in polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
Eighty-eight-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who along with his wife participated in the separatist protest, said he no longer hoped for the prospect of independence for Catalonia.
“We had some of the best moments last year.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we’re in a dead end,” he said.
Despite the important, though close victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their best-known leaders either went into exile on their own, or awaiting deportation in return for the organization.
Twenty-four-year-old technician Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on her phone, saying the conflict had been fomented by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression we have witnessed from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Crash Into House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being repeatedly hit by a car in a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the house were damaged.
At one point, someone fired a shot at the car.
Mengo's hit secured Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who had moved from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and only gave Steven Gerrard a second defeat out of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team hasn’t won the Premier League this season and will face the first Hearts to lose eight points next Sunday.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended a series of games without a defeat in the division to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston did not take advantage of the opportunity against indecisive guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because his straightforwardness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow in the slide just passed Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
It was enough for the homes to watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew that guests could suffer from standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
A free kick was ordered against the Rangers and Livingston made a hole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly dispatched Menga, who ran and scored the ball in the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but the home defense for them was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly not busy.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's legs and Lithgow did not hit from another standard Livingston situation.
The penalty area of Livingston was constantly flown by the centers, which the players cleaned up continuously, and two penalty kicks came in vain – after Halkett’s attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and another by hand.
“The Phenomenon” of Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were without exception excellent and on their way up they continue to exceed expectations.
Their style of play and the team have hardly changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves great praise for the way the team has thrilled since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was awesome, leading a well-arranged defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby all the time.
The Rangers are lacking in inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they no longer meet these standards.
Their finish was poor – they only penetrated the home side once – and for the Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on a number of topics, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s admission into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
In this city is the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police for security reasons prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people, many of them Kurds, were also heard protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Counter-protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: cyclist dies after collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred around 10:15 local time near the Bestwood Street junction with the bustling Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and soon the ambulance arrived, but the man was dead on the spot.
The death occurred just a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday's tragedy in an accident on Childers Street when the driver escaped from the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said police are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The roads are closed, buses run on alternative routes and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in riots in the men's prison with high security.
The riots erupted at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 local time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To manage the riots, which involved eight prisoners in one wing, specialized Tornado team supervisors were called in.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “In order to manage the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison workers were deployed.
Six staff members were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and may spend longer time behind bars.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the director of the prison had ended after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
And last October, law enforcement was summoned to prison because of serious riots in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (a drought-prone area)
It’s not common for Arizona to be hit by a tropical low-pressure rift, but that’s exactly what will happen early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa will surpass the desert southwest and bring the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or pressure lower status within 320 km of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to drop 25 to 50 mm, with local sums up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the Rosy rain can be a blessing because the area has been hit by drought.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these precipitations may help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States has just hit the drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona’s population is experiencing at least “extreme drought,” which is the second highest category.
The route of Hurricane Rosa will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico on Sunday morning and will move at 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and therefore loses its strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico there will be heavy rainfall, which poses a high risk of flooding.
“A total of 75 to 150 mm of precipitation is expected in the area from Baja California to northwestern Sonoran, and it can occur up to 250 mm,” weather.com said.
Rosa then travels across Mexico as a tropical storm to the north and arrives at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, then crosses Arizona and enters southern Utah on Tuesday late in the evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will cause deadly flooding and mudslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four People Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a stabbed 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now “stable”.
According to police in Avon and Somerset, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who may have a mobile phone record of what happened.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Has "Sworn Into Evil and Anger" by Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the reckless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a ballot in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "condemned the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also spoke at the hearing on her allegations.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “Americans witnessed Kavanaugh’s excellence and quality and courage.”
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service on his account.”
The president indirectly tapped Kavanaugh’s nomination when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to participate in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats had opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
A senior Republican adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination in the Senate was expected no later than Friday.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to increase
Authorities said on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were wiped out by the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, but at twilight the coast was hit by waves of up to six meters, which killed many people and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat surfaced yesterday, people were still carrying on activities on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they fell victim to the waves,” Indonesia’s BNPB disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugro said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave didn't go alone, it took cars, piles, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before the coastal impact, the open-sea tsunami wave was spreading at 800 km/h.
He said some people fled to the trees and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster mitigation agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal town on Saturday as well.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the area where live 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquakes was about 200 times the strength of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have increased the wave of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found tucked under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of casualties and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication was "completely protected without any information" from Donggala.
The Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were living in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers were targeting the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," the statement said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
On amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building is heard screaming desperately to warn people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the coast will be hit by a water wall that carries buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the record immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
According to authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city has been reopened only for aid transport and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paula, where employees were hiding in shelters from buildings built in the yard of the office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba says.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he adds.
It's too bad.
When aid groups started a sad disaster relief operation, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start flowing to the disaster site when a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but that’s not yet the case.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami came in Paul, friends and relatives of those who are still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be those miracles that lighten the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned under the rubble beside her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia this month.
Other people imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr. Gendon described how in the hours following the paragliding community learned of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he was desperate to send messages via WhatsApp to competitors from Palu who were attending the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue ticks, his messages ended with a gray mark.
“I think that means that the reports were not delivered,” he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while refilling ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker on Friday morning while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
In the report, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote, the driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to put more money into it.
While doing so, another man “runned behind a Brink employee” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
Any information on the identity of the suspects should be reported to the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: “A creature formally known as Kanye West.”
The 34-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is scheduled to release his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for “feeling reasons,” the show’s creator said.
West has already said that the word for him has, in addition to the abbreviation of the current professional name, also a religious meaning.
“In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when he spoke to radio host Big Boy about his album.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are."
Many other famous rappers have also changed their name.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, also used to write his name alternately with and without a consonant, and both in capital and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use army against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when the left-wing student movement was spreading throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting at people on October 2, 1968, at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding for artificial intelligence
According to investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government released announcements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, introduced a plan last year that it wants to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the U.S. and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big breakthrough in AI will be made in the United States.
Lee, who published Houghton Mifflin Harcourt’s book Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that outperformed the best American player in the Othello game, and later served as Microsoft’s chief research officer and president of Google’s Chinese affiliate.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, according to Lee.
“Academic ranks aren’t taking away from China, they’re taking away from corporations,” Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best university professionals in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help improve AI efforts in the United States.
“In my opinion, the holders of a doctorate in the field of AI should be automatically offered green cards,” he says.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Council and other government organizations donating money to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense has set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence this year to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House has announced the creation of the Selection Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF Foundation, it now invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and therefore vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised doubts about whether at least 50 percent of voters will be needed to keep the referendum going.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska from Skopje.
While the referendum is not binding, enough MPs have said they will follow the outcome of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no problems had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters ultimately cast their votes.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a Macedonian referendum on changing the name that would open the country’s way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumice, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and pulls out chairs in front of tents erected by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the door for slavery,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don’t want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%, so much needed investment.
"I think the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
The “yes” result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey released by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, the referendum could involve between 30 and 43 percent of voters – less than the required participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV station found that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its inception last May.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came for a goal through the whole defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton on Saturday, securing Manchester City a 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In giving Aguero, his goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with a touchdown that the Argentine striker got in the middle of the field.
He moved between the three Brighton defenders and got into the open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the outskirts of the Brighton Penalty Territory, he bypassed one defender and overtook several others.
He found Sterling on the left.
The English striker hit the ball in the penalty area back to Aguero, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is having trouble with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We thought he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
The initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match, however, was arranged by Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
On the left he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote bar.
The Sky Blues shoved the ball into the net just before it slipped out of the field.
City will play against Hoffenheim at 12:55 on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies
When the Nationals were kicked out of the playoffs, there were not many reasons to re-enter.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitcher’s place in a game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday – but only when the Rockies, who lead the NL West for one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have hope for the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card victory 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to win their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play anything, we can at least play because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with probably the greatest effort I will experience this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to throw Scherzer in such situations.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start. On Thursday, he would train and throw on Sunday, when he usually has free time.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has statistics 18-7 this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump Speaks at Meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly commented on the situation around his candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to take part in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we can do will be at stake.
There are five weeks left before one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but we’re still on the move and I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by any means necessary, you see there wickedness, resistance.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to roll over to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we don’t give it to them.”
According to him, the Democrats opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying the Democrats are "angry and evil and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud clamor of the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you take out the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait—it was really bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse stream of opinion.
He is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the Moment activists in my local party voted for my admonition, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs to be told that they are not welcome – because they have sincerely expressed their opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized in a reminder that I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, paradoxically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a statement on Friday’s meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East, it was written that “we want the meetings to be accessible and productive.”
For most of the eight years I was a local MP for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, most meetings do not take place today, and the promise of “kinder, kinder” politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged to be acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues, who I used to think we had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180° and take positions that I would otherwise not be able to agree with – whether it was the EU’s shock or national security.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – then comes the tyranny of social media bullying, where they call for my appeal, condemn the politics of the center and tell me I shouldn’t be on the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments targeting me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those, colleagues, who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but will never give up.
One aspect of this era of politics that I am most disappointed with is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that diverse stream of opinion and with each proposal to express distrust or change the rules of selection, the party becomes more limited.
Over the past two years, I’ve been advised many times to hold back, not talk so much, and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher’s government, which literally broke up my general school class, I’ve been trying to fight for better public services for those who need them most—whether as local councillors or ministers.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised at all by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would say only that when the country breaks into Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will deter me from doing what I think is best for you.
Chris Leslie is a member of parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unchained Ayr rises to the top
The two late fives slightly distorted the final result, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly fun Tennent’s Premiership match.
Now they're at the top of the table as the only losers.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of the chances, which helped the homers to win, and coach Peter Murchie had full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve gone through big tests in our matches and we’re still defeated, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, “All the honor to Ayr, they took the chance better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's five in the 14th minute, altered by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantages and Jason Baggot got an unaltered five.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty and then scored and turned the solo try into 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's five, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher, and when he started playing again, Ayr jumped again thanks to Stafford McDowall's five, which he transformed into Climo.
Deputy captain Ayra Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the player extra thanks to the unchanged five Bruce Colvin after a short strong push.
The homers returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow for attacking Clima without the ball, MacPherson from the penalty set placed the ball behind the advancing Maule Ayra.
Climo changed, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five homers.
Still Game Star Launches New Career in Hospitality
It seems that the star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry. It turns out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 66-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and in which he plays alongside longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in a series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to an excerpt from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan wants to engage in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": inland Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are guarding the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Above public buildings there is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the motto: “The sea is ours.
Obtaining it is our duty.”
Across inland Bolivia there is still a vivid memory of the coast that the country lost to Chile in the bloody resource war of the 19th century – as well as the desire to re-cross the Pacific Ocean.
These desires are perhaps the biggest in several decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the international court, which is due to fall on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the MSD decision on big screens across the country in the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after many decades of interrupted talks – Chile is obliged to act on granting Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
The charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, is also very interested in Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and said it would not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the MSD’s decision comes just six months after the latest arguments were heard shows that the case “was not complicated,” according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, not only have they not supported the cause of Bolivia, but they may have slowed it down.
“The current Bolivian government has taken over the issues of access to the sea,” says Zárate.
He adds that Morales’ attacking rhetoric has weakened all of Chile’s remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will one day start to act again, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused to use Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – the question of the sea as a political cliffhanger.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to discover that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the U.S. can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington
Ri spoke at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the summit of the leaders of the two rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which is stuck at a dead end, more than three months for a Singaporean meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says there is “planning hope” that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War could sometimes bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang seriously thinks it will abandon this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Parades Show That The Latest Trend Of Huge Headwear Is Coming To Your Fashion Stores Soon
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of stunned huge head coverings for their spring/summer 2019 collections at a show that caught everyone’s eye at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the piers.
An exhibition piece from Valentin was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide feather-like edge that flooded the heads of the models.
Other overly large accessories were decorated melons, a witch hat and even pineapples – but they are not intended to warm up the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and look more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving gear with a snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a cornucopia with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion – you’re lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could even reach the fashion stores.
Overgrown hats come after "La Bomba", a straw with a half-meter-wide creme that everyone wore from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat that flooded social media has sent another huge creation to the show pier – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model in her swimsuit.
A dark orange raffia bag lined with raffia shakers and equipped with a white leather handle was an exhibition piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection by Jacquemuse at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for next summer – given the designer’s success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for excessively large accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have achieved a number of academic successes and this continues in 2018 with other excellent test results. Individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community activities only underline this.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) represents more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland and strives to provide the best level of service to its pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement individually tailored school education plans, we observe that modern languages are still popular and sought-after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.”
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year’s exams show that languages are at the top of the tables, with independent schools having the highest rate of success.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved the best grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that the highest grade A was achieved by 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects chosen by students are equally valued in the curricula of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 percent of job vacancies are insufficient language skills, for reasons that employers cite as a problem.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are a necessity in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages automatically gains an advantage over the competition.
According to a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15 percent, being French.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially those of emerging economies, they will be more likely to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school is different in what languages it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have a choice of several languages at independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At this point, there is no denying that languages are essential in the global business environment for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and attraction.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will appear in the Lakers' jersey for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers are looking forward to it soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the season in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
It is unclear how many minutes it will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the pre-season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games,” he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaign talks tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Due to the suspension of the vote to confirm his nominee for a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in November.
What time does Trump’s show start tonight and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time, today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below via live YouTube.
Trump will likely be talking about the hearing of the candidate for Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court, which took place this week and was very tense due to allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The Senate confirmation vote is expected to be postponed a week before the FBI's investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of rallying is to help Republicans pick up the pace before the November election.
According to Reuters, Trump’s campaign organizers say the five meetings next week aim to “energize volunteers and supporters so Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible during this busy campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania" could attend today's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and be watched by the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, in which he earned more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to assist him in his explorations," West Virginia University political scientist Simon Haeder told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows stomach to fight to keep hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, the pair could be exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where's the pendulum going now?
"They took six points and now it's four, so we take it so the pendulum is probably moving a little towards us," Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, it leads by four points and there are twelve more.
As Spieth says, Americans feel like they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and everyone can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly in the transition from the launch pad to the green and is an example.
The celebratory screams even intensified the continuation of his wheel as he managed to win the whole game with Tomas after two holes behind.
His putt, who won their 15-hole match, encountered a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all the players left behind.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but adorable couple from Europe are four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood was the only couple who didn't hit the hole on Saturday afternoon, but also missed it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
The course and the way the energy flows both towards the stormy audience confirms from him that these are players destined for Sunday’s victory, and that there will be no more favorite player than Fleetwood or Molinari until sunset over Le Golf National.
It is best to use both at the same time in a different hole.
Speaking of European fame, however, remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergi Garcia, the hero of the morning game of four balls, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A hole and two jacks on the front nine buried the Spaniards and the Swedes in the abyss, from which they no longer climbed.
No one will be able to help you on Sunday.
Playing two pairs of two balls is so fascinating when you closely observe the interactions of people in a pair, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change in the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the last day, but this game of two pairs has also shown that the US team has a stomach for fighting that some, especially from states, have doubted.
To the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads by a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's two-ball duo games came out with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won nearly twice over wrestler Tiger Woods, they decided to make four innings at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine, dominated the two-ball morning games with the American side, which failed in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two games, but could not get into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points out of 12 Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair to win four points out of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a two-ball game, they beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even harder 5&4.
Woods, who stretched for two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in a doubles game to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after playing two balls in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a 2&1 doubles game to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – world number one and three.
Europe, however, did not win on this pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris on the whole line.
Triple lead winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas took two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 win over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a doubles game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a double, though as a defender Fury's side only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that Sunday's counterattack is behind them.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally and without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continuing U.N. sanctions had deepened its mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general meeting that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to disarm unilaterally.
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for each step, his statement appeared significant in that he did not reject the timilion for unilateral denuclearization.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “denuclearizing the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States is insisting on ‘denuclearization first’ and increasing the pressure on sanctions to enforce its objectives, and even opposing ‘declaring an end to war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the U.N. earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea and not the United States were on the side of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come into such a bleak situation.”
However, Rih’s tone was dramatically different from last year’s, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting of U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea’s “total destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work still needs to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is completely wiped out.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for it, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without ceasing until we are aware of complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to suppress funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo and Ri met at the U.N. General Assembly, and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July, stating that progress had been made, only to be declared by North Korea in a matter of hours as "gangster demands".
North Korea this month pledged to meet with Moon to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he hoped were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course designed to teach them to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has forced all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studios all night long, where students don’t sleep and are encouraged with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of caring for themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women’s Hospital, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this only now, in my final year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were really not sleeping during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of student colleges where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another part, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in “studying all night long” still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is also growing.
Enough good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation switches the brain to a mode of starvation, so a person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that he took in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting the alarm for the time to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga sank Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy found Steven Gerrard dissatisfied with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side attempted to record their first win from February 4 to February 1, triumphing at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his eight-point position from the top leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes ahead of the half-time and the Rangers team seemed uninspired and determined to tie the knot.
While the Rangers are now dropping to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and right behind the Hibernian team to the difference of one goal.
And there could be other Rangers problems after line referee Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after apparently being hit by an object from the spectator.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, scoring around Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up the Hearts point last week and would be delighted as his well-trained team choked their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the hold, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after the start, when Menga first let Scott Pittman on goal by Allan McGregor, but the back-up bury his big shot.
Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a penalty for a quarter-hour run when he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson erased the Colombian challenge from the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots to the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by a header from Lassana Coulibaly and a soft shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for the work already.
The Rangers were once again unable to cope with Jacobs' deep set.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and picked Meng for the easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost instant result when the wing collapsed into Morelos, but the imposing Kelly struggled from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game exactly the kind they liked when Lithgow and Halkett threw one long ball after another.
Holt's side may have deepened their lead in the final stages, but McGregor was well positioned to block Jacobs before Litgow ran from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another delayed penalty claim when he messed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of Geiger's Counters
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years, and still growing... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger Counter also became a steady pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: "Well, now it's really cracking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention, which bears his name, lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Dangerous Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can "see" the protein that is common to many cancers, and then rivet re-injected
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells, died of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, converting them into a laboratory, so they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then be re-applied into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and “teached” them to target cancer cells, was already promoted in the treatment of leukemia type.
Kanye West took part in a pro-Trump sermon, in his maga cap, after his appearance at the SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was cast in the Saturday Night Live studio after a confusing performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Again hat, he began to spit on the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump, is he a racist?’
“If I were a racist, I wouldn’t have been in America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL began a show of parodies starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of raping Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's theatrical speech footage was recorded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he got to eat his headpiece nicely even behind the scenes.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his superman suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only earned the buzz of the audience at least twice, and SNL members looked upset, embarrassed, Variety says, and one person even said, "The whole studio was completely silenced."
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many by singing the song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous characters: THANK YOU FOR DIVIDING DAVU."
But guest talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing."
“But I DO NOT want to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by promoting his ‘art’) who I believe represents and broadcasts to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he is now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Lion and of course the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to stand trial in Belfast on Monday.
The indictment will be reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington let go of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
The 31-year-old actor, however, stepped out of the stereotype of a macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel like they have to be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believes “something is wrong” and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of the Throne star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that he is "quite strongly" expressing himself to this problem.
“At this moment I personally feel, quite strongly – what’s wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach teenage men about the problem we’re seeing here?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What do boys learn on television, on the streets, from them grows the feeling that every man needs to have such a page?
I think this is really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because young men have certainly changed something for the worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series is finished, because he has enough of "fights and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will play Sam Shepard in the restored True West, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife while filming the series, so he gave me my future family and my entire subsequent life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected by the virus.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people per year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection during these intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking senators' GOP data, bending the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced claims that a member of her staff had sent personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' wiki pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were backed by “ultra-right” scientists and websites.
“Lies, lies, and other despicable lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The information allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of them from Utah.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual abuse by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address which sources the posts are linked to Waters’ office and have published information about Waters’ staff members, Hill says.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated assertion is a complete falsehood and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly earned online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he has no temperament to be a member of Congress."
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't be resistant.
It must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
They need to be calm and not get excited.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it were true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “the relevant authorities and authorities involved in criminal proceedings to these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English again hits reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It’s already common to look for Brexit in every new British-looking film, as it seems to be the case for Johnny English’s revival in the action parody series – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this bold satire on the topic of how obviously bad a nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this elaborate, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to rebuild things in a whole new way – that name more than anything else a signal that it is a broad comic book intended for an English-speaking cinema audience.
He is of course the dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and a big piece of the guy who sang the only tone in the sound of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics in London.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man, who Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV commercials Barclaycard, and who left chaos behind.
In this last edition of JE you will find one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the blades of the rotor shortly zinked about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but humor feels quite undersized and oddly redundant, especially when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are now offering comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like it's meant for kids than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy tramps are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gags in Mr. Bean's face.
It is a constant assumption that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground, terrifying an agent on duty – too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who is a pompous and intrigued character who is already suffering from the complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this favorite Theresa May character as best she can, but in the script there is nothing too much.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
That means Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury facility, but at the same time gives record lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his former long-suffering partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an affected character that Vicki Pepperdine may be wasting a bit of her talent on.
So Batman and Robin, packing up tasks for Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously subject to the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British cybercrime: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of frivolous palates: disguised as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they create chaos as they sneak aboard Volt's luxury yachts; and English sets off pure anarchy as they try to get to know the interior of the house through virtual reality.
All of the aces are definitely ready for this final sequence, but as kind and stormy as it may be, it has something of a children's television inside it.
Quite a moderate thing.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the heads of companies to hand over to workers the savings resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but still receive the same reward.
Sources claim that this idea would “cast” into the party’s economic agenda and plans to incline the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A longtime Labour member told the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits into the party’s attitudes to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not our party’s policy and the party does not take it into account.”
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s working conference to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from “anonymous directors” and “experts” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not have to return to their overall share, as the Labour government could carry out “coups” based on perceived guilt.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors of companies and create funds for own ownership that transfer 10% of private enterprise equity to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on the show "60 minutes" whether the FBI investigation Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s findings could sway some Republican senators into campaigning for their support.
In a "60 Minutes" interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would force them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the accusation came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
However, Graham's decision is unshakable.
“Beyond Brett Kavanaugh, I have already made my decision and that would be a really explosive accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York City, which offers a very impressive array of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people who will meet at Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of Global Poverty, an international group to promote poverty eradication by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before it achieved its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really in the way of convincing them to demand an action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel that signing an online petition or tweeting will change something?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
He says these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and measures of more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that hedged funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a note in history of social injustice in the form of malnutrition,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 events calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website with the question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard journey – sometimes we fall and fail.
But just like great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the performers at this year’s New York festival, which will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the navy for a "blockade" that would prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can resort to the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy as much as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the opportunity, with the help of our Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, to ensure that their energy is not going to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is perceived as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less investment in or replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-purpose" player with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and has replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “hostage” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s zealous opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for developing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States has taken a stance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has urged the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to “look closely” at 2020 presidential nomination, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she will "look closely" at her candidacy for president.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top female position,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will be looking closely at the presidential candidacy.”
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting, saying she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I fear to the bone what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think she should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-ranking Democratic names discussed in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being listed in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may be about other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told audiences at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that "someone else is coming back, they are coming back healed, they are coming back and they are asking if there is any respect for the things that their fellow countrymen and airmen are doing, and every other member.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interference with a report of domestic violence, and possession of a gun in drunkenness, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla's police department.
18 States, D.C. Supports Call for New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. government’s measures to deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the county issued a brief report Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge the move, NBC reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of the violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace-supporting states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 immigrant appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new measures “ignore a decade of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the short friend said.
Lawyers also briefly argued that policies that deny immigration harm the U.S. economy and say they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum in June to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been aimed at alleviating all the problems – not even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, where the number of victims has already doubled, race in search of survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“It’s very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her feverish little boy at an evacuation center in the bustling city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking themselves up through soaked things, and trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were destroyed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were paralyzed.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a spine and shoulder fracture, rested at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside for continued severe subsequent shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. newspaper dealing with the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned a paid China Daily surcharge in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's largest selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections in the U.S. on November 6.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election pointed to what U.S. officials said Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that is manifesting at the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is now doubling this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is harnessing America’s precious tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Unlike in a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited disagreements and you will not see any real reflection of the disagreements that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media belongs to the “China Communist Party” company.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers refused to offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Leave Voters Before Election Due to Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
Like many top Republicans, a candidate for top judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sexual assault charges, analysts warned they would get a response during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
Emotions around this case were extremely high and most Republicans on record already say they want to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to reassure voters at the last minute to seek an FBI investigation.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, a newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" at a rally in the Senate hall, where Republicans in charge of the justice commission decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say it was high, that’s true.”
But it could be higher, especially among hesitant women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who don’t like the president, but often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, resistance could follow.
“There was a messed up mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits in the chair, it’s also about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, the U.S. director of priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, said in a statement.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in opinion, who to trust in light of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with slightly more sympathies for the latter named.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or certain to be lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from the Flake FBI, he is currently investigating Ford’s charges, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her her genitals at a party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet and outsmart Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of this startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available in one and all browsers at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the goal of the project is to bring the resources, processes and relevant skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the employees working on the project have collaborated on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about introducing a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in a press release on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion of net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergyman who received the Victorian Cross during World War I
The celebrations have taken place a hundred years since the only spiritual Church of England won the Cross of Victoria as a warrior during the First World War.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "ingeniously symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victorious deed.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with very dense fog and heavy firing from cannons and machine guns.
Later he reached the front line and with the "highest courage" led the line forward, before throwing himself separately into the field of fire and knocking out three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were "something I would never do, but at the same time something that is humiliating."
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, they placed a wreath after a show led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “a great honor to be able to take part in the show,” adding that “the bravery of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be provided by many people.”
MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of getting Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the bloated Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The San José bill contained 13 points, including six on the main card, and live broadcasting took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, viewers in the UK were astounded when the news turned into the Peppa Pig Show.
Some remained unsettled after waking up to the match until the early hours of the morning.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in broadcasting on the children's show as "a certain form of a bad joke."
“According to the government’s decree, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., and therefore it is necessary to broadcast children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, after being asked about the broadcast.
"The Peppa Pig," yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they would work on the program so that viewers in the UK would be involved in the future.
“I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it,” Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock on Sunday morning and we won’t be able to do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, the government could have done it.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We reduced it to five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried our best to keep the promise to the fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Undervalued’ by Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality — but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until he got into high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics because of the possibility of becoming a parent.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show, had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a spoiler in Lavern's first show, said he felt "less valued" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "Until now, these feelings of inferiority and differentiation were the real things that gave me the strength and power to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “Someone,” he said, not to disappoint anyone who might find out what was going on with his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT rights fighter and has used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
This three-time world champion said his falling in love with a man—American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013—had him “unprepared.”
Daley married the Oscar holder, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age — he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died three years later of cancer — he said it wasn’t easy to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said he had "changed his whole point of view."
“If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style of ‘I want to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew I had dreamed of it all my life – jumping in front of our home team at the Olympics, I don’t feel better,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – Proud by Heather Small – which resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and still evoked goose skin in it.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson would have set a record when he played the 47th Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he would have had to level up to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the events held every two years for the 12th time, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench at Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of things, as was often the case in the U.S., the five-time main winner spent his day alternating between cheerleaders and working on a game in a row he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, even at the height of his career, so he is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National, where the long strewn terrain routinely punishes lost shots.
And if the golf course itself isn’t worrying enough, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth Sunday match, who won all four of his games this week in the team with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, escaped a quick start, Mickelson's sword could prove to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man and added nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, he slaps me on the back, puts his hand around my shoulder and says he'll be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He believes so much.
He is a member of the Straw Hall and has been so helpful to these teams in the past week as well.
I had no idea he was going to play two cats.
I imagined more, but that's how it evolved, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald’s record in most Western Ryder Cups played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his team presence brought some intangible results.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make people laugh, and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun when they went to see him this week, which was fun to watch.
It gives a lot more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows Big Leadership May Soon Disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the great lead of the last few days in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward ride.
Dane made his debut at the 1997 game in Valderrama, where the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they reached the finish line with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You must always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only tightly," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching them win 5-3 in the year 2018 to Golf 10-6 on Friday and yesterday.
So history and every member of the team has shown me that this is not behind us.
You will be bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all those points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to get the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players handled the complex golf course, added: “I would never have done it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and that's too difficult.
It’s great to be out with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re there to be by yourself, your golfer’s ability is fully tested.
That’s the message you have to pass on to the players, get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners, with exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great upheavals when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn to then end up as a loser when Europe reached the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to go to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start fast like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts considerable pressure on the midfielders.
Accordingly, we set up the setup and made sure that the boys felt like you know, like we were supposed to spell tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and confront Rory McIlroy in the top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half.
“I went with that group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The latest German naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and a snowy coastline, local media said.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, a brand new frigate of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, an army spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to become part of the Navy in 2014, but demanding post-delivery problems made the fate of this ambitious project unpleasant.
As a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates, four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg-class, which were ordered by the navy in 2007, will serve.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with powerful cannons, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside the home port.
However, the constant delays mean that the top-of-the-line naval ships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be obsolete by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The infamous frigate F125 got into the newspapers last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturer after it was handed over.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of major "software errors and defects on the metal elements" defects that would render the warship unusable when deployed in combat.
Software failures were particularly significant, as the Baden-Württemberg-class vessel will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors – half the workforce needed on the Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defects in the metal elements, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – is also a problem.
It is said that from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion, the price has risen to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates have become increasingly important, especially in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, confirmed that the navy was indeed “entraining ships capable of deployment.”
This representative stated that the problems were continually unloading because old ships were decommissioned but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to become part of the Navy's equipment.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new research is underway at a bat habitat on the Scottish Highlands to discover how bats use the landscape for food hunting.
There is hope that the research findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future activities for the conservation of this species.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow bats from the winged and the smallest, and brown long and watery, in the Inverewe Gardens botanical garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas of this bat habitat, which will monitor bat activities throughout the entire season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls of bats and what each species does.
Subsequently, a map of the habitat and a report will be issued, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural resource conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow formation, and best practices in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
Flea populations in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain have been declining significantly in the last century.
They are endangered as a result of construction and territorial development, which affect colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks, can also pose a risk.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, colony checks and sometimes also rescue work.
The organization even set up the first and only reserve bat reservation at the Threave settlement in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
Residential manager David Thompson says that this is the ideal area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there’s still too much we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It emphasizes the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and young, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put her hand to work and help.
She said, "We have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we do not know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges and His Lawyers Are Going to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people “want to make themselves visible” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which reported on the allegations.
This Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the case, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were released, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers and described the information as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball winner to the camera.
“They want to live on in my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm okay," the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald’s lawyers are going to indict the newspaper Der Spiegel on unsubstantiated charges that they called “an inadmissible notice of suspicion in the private sector.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount of the corresponding severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent times.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel suites and in a casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the gaming room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent” and “one percent” disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and feared “public humiliation.”
A 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to reopen the trial because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was accused of attacking Real Madrid from Manchester United and bought by the famous Italian club Juve for 100 million euros this summer.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will "forever regret" losing its status as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, company secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the borders if no Brexit deal is concluded could cost jobs.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis plant in Burnaston produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would see production stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without a deal in terms of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its production plant for Mini cars in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers call a supply chain risk in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on a “right on time” basis, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU being delivered for cars made to order within 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be a breach at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, resulting in a production shutdown.
Theresa May’s plans to revive future relations with the EU are “precisely calibrated so that these border checks do not take place.”
“We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also seizing this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“Evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must absolutely be able to continue what is a highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, it warns that the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is the chairman of the unions in the plant, said that the union members are increasingly concerned: “I have the experience that once these places are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “another week” as the fight for the post of top judge continues with Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the special council of Robert Mueller, which examines the interference in the Russian elections, the ties between Trump’s supporters and Russia, and possible judicial obstructions by the president.
Whether Trump releases the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardizes Mueller’s independence, Washington’s talks have been saturated with it for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "prefer not" release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI weekly investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote once again.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There is no date set yet, it may be this week, maybe it will be necessary to postpone the next week taking into account everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and will always share the latest news with the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said too few press conferences were not caused by aversion to the “spectacle” of television reporters, even though she said, “I don’t agree with the fact that he’s going to perform.”
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him,” she added, without providing any evidence.
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We are trying and you have seen that we have been doing this in the last few weeks and that there will be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly receives inquiries when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with attending senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president has probably shown why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of gathered reporters.
Health Minister Writes to EU Workers at NHS Scotland to Not Be Afraid of Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude and wishes that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter not even six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to settle the costs of requests for settlement status of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal are continuing, and they are heading towards the expected decisions this fall.
However, the UK government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal withdrawal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reassure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to patients and the communities we provide services to.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our warm wish is that you stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee defender Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred a short time ago.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical professionals gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines and then put him on a stretcher and prepared for further assessment.
A Tennessee official told Chrisz Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details on the type/size of injuries” are yet available and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-grader in a red shirt, completes the first season for the state of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, he had five total operations, which means a total of 18 operations in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy a property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans.
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s move, which aims to attract young voters.
Increasing the duty of higher property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
A <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annual increase in the state treasury is expected to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher property purchase tax when they buy a property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and focus on high-income people.
The increase in property purchase tax will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, while the money will further strengthen the government’s efforts to fight homelessness.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property purchase tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago at other homes and purchases for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
The State Treasury is expected to raise funds by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13 percent of non-UK residents buy newly built properties in London, avoiding prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get home.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property purchase tax to help more young people build their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping real estate prices high by occupying land but not using it, and urged May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to repair the “hostile home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a compelling series of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the cessation of "harmless" evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I want to dedicate my efforts as prime minister to renewing the British dream – that every new generation has a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape their lives here.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for entities that do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to be able to buy homes just as hard-working residents of the UK.
For many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real.”
Jack Ross: “My highest ambition is to lead Scotland”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “highest ambition” is to become Scotland’s manager at some stage.
42-year-old Skot enjoys the challenge of restoring the northeastern club, which currently holds third place in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got rank B and it was," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that pulls me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I were successful in the management of the club.”
Ross's predecessors in the role of Sunderland managers were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he did not feel any anxiety about the succession of such well-established names in such a large club when he previously refused prelims from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the time was measured by whether I could get this club back into the Premier League.
Due to the structure and equipment of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him back there, but I think I would feel successful if I could only get the club back there.”
Ross made a career in leadership for only three years, before serving as an assistant manager at Dumarton and spending 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third group and transformed St Mirren from a starting relegation into a champions title winner the following season.
And Ross says he’s feeling much better now than he ever has in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"They were probably real crossroads," he recalls the time he took Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was good, I made a good deal of money, and I enjoyed the reasonable heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through each week.
I still go through them in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good in leadership.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, I feel like I feel the most in my entire adult life.”

Research has found that the great time on the pint is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the incomes of British bars struggling, but it has increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars saw sales increases of 2.7 percent in July – but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, the consulting firm that produced the final reports, said: “Stable sunshine and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as previous June, when the visits to pubs increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more than expected.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
The bars and bars that attracted drinks have so far been doing the most similarly as the restaurants have worsened.
The landlords, whose main revenue is from food, also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent over the month, while food sales declined by three percent.”
Paul Newman of the hospitality and leisure analytics firm said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to selling outside the domestic market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, although an annual drop of 4.8 percent in sales will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer can’t be a worse time for food-grabbing business operators, and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring so much needed relief.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor for the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, an industry benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – aged just 11 – has a secret social media account that hides from parents and educators, research shows.
Research among 20,000 high school students showed an increase in “fake Instagram pages”
Reports have raised fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of pupils said they have a “main” account that their parents know about.
One in five children at the age of 11 creates accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid rise in “fake Instagram accounts” on which they share photos.
Reports indicate that there is a concern that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of pupils said they have an embellished “main” account that their parents know about, while also having a private account.
One mother, who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, found that her teenage daughter was urging others to “rape her.”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be the "Voice of Athletes" in Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the highest-rated lightweight athlete, and President Ian Beattie has described moving as a great opportunity for those who are in sports leadership like those who will benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for athletics in Scotland to be a member of the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be truly beneficial and to help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in the 200 and 400 metres, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I was attacked a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will heal or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again, and I'm doing the exercises today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!”
Milk extractor inducing comparison of mothers to cows shares opinions online
The company involved in the production of vacuum cleaners has divided online opinion with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to nursing cows.
As part of the launch of “the world’s first silent portable vacuum cleaner,” the consumer technology company Envi has released a music video featuring the freedom that the new vacuum cleaner gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows singing the lyrics: "Yes, I'm impressed, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed I don't have a femur, here are my breasts."
The choir continues: “Pump, pump, I’m feeding the children, pump, pump, I’m feeding my sweet milk.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked a controversial online reaction.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom said it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very miserable decision to abuse cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth so they can give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after giving birth,” one of the comments says.
Elvie suction cup is discretely engaged on breastfeeding (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Clearly traumatic for mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added, “This ad is completely off.”
There were also those who defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that she considered the song "contagious".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get the pump if I was still breastfeeding.
When I suck, I feel like a cow.
Advertisement is a little crazy, but it's about the thing.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who suck milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows.’
It’s not an advertisement to praise or curse the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they are all dancing with discreet suction cups hidden under the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that many women who suck milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie suction cup is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and hides beautifully in the breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the baby and even walk when sucking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added: “Elvie’s suction cup is so revolutionary that it deserves a strong and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and lactating cows, we wanted to highlight milk suction and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable incredible feeling of freedom that the new suction cup will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner's been exposed.
During London Fashion Week, one of the mothers of Marta Jakubowski, who was using the product, showed up on the pier.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Texas Border Tent Camp
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially because harsh rhetoric and principles put in place by the Trump administration have hampered the placement of accompanying children.
Most of the escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of being threatened with staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the immigration and customs department, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for the status of escorting single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor household are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," Mr Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children’s cases, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of the earlier standard 60 days.
Many will appear through a videoconferencing call rather than in person to declare their case as legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in care, the more likely he is to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, asylum workers say, reporting reports from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say these concerns are heightened in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is suffering are more likely to go unnoticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or goodbye to friends could trigger the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish "occupation components" should be withdrawn immediately
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, even though the country is already in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian territory are illegal under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "it will be dealt with accordingly."
"He must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over", with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more lost their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we get rid of all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegally present foreigners.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 war-torn countries in its territory.
While extraditing the refugees, Moualem said there were good conditions for them to return, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational concerns" that caused the refugees to refuse to return.
“We have spoken to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no recovery aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a protection zone in the last refuge of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by the Russian-protected Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the deal had "clearly set deadlines" and expressed hope that the military intervention would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front organization with a link to Al-Qaeda, who would be "exterminated."
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections will soon take place.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "checking the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning against interference.
Why Trump will win in the second half
According to this logic, Donald Trump would have won another election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers hope, the indictment and scandals did not prematurely end his tenure as president.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidential term in history!”
So far, there have been no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers on CNN’s main broadcast time has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average attendance of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and the "Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has increased attendance on cable to 3.5 million following the main nightly news.
“It’s the heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, the host of the “Designated Survivor” show, told ABC’s drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, an experienced comedy and comedy author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's having fun,'" Mrs Scovell told me.
It is the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story taking place in of Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wada, whether immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Alignment is a luxury that only the most privileged followers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you’re an informed citizen when you’re watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward is using “deep backup” resources for his book “Fear,” scouring Paul Manafort’s $15,000 leather jackets (“dressed by arrogance”), as Trump put it.
I'm not going to look at Super Maria the same way again.
“Part of what it does and what makes it feel like a reality show is that it feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars documentary about the rotating N.F.L. Trump show, in which it praises Kim Jong-un.

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside on the north bank of Kauai at 80 degrees, but he was stranded inside and watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money flows from the outside to the tightest domestic mid-term elections
It is no surprise that 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing an influx of finances thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that have generated two office holders in the fight for the same chair.
This recently led to the redevelopment of suburban Pittsburg county by county Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – who won another county in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps strongly with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, maps were redrawn.
The race in the new 17th district started a heated financial dispute between the main party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March Special Elections to the 18th Congressional District.
This chair has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump won by 20 points in the county.
Politicians give Democrats a slight lead.
America considers fining El Salvador for supporting China, then resigns
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying in a hotel in Panama until the partners forcibly relocated the Trump leadership’s organizational team.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to dismiss the U.S. directors of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions not to further recognize Taiwan," ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included cuts to financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rate.
With ongoing internal talks, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following similar talks from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the US.
But by mid-September, senior management officials had made it clear that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively end any penalties considered for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal that the administration is putting on hold, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without having any new irrefutable news from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government executive and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History (disambiguation)
A definitive nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller’s report from the special commission on the possible obstruction of Mr Trump’s enforcement of the law, which is now heavily evidenced in public records.
In his investigation, Mr Mueller also allegedly turns to whether Mr Trump’s campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there were an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to hold himself accountable before this body, just as he is preparing to appear again before the electorate, and in the end he would probably be awaited by a jury composed of his colleagues.
That’s a whole series of “if,” and I don’t want to say that Trump’s downfall is inevitable – just like with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, it was enough for the Western powers to stand up and support him in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man here who is in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein had been upset since the report announced that he had secretly proposed to record the president last year and had speculated that he was not medically fit to hold the presidential office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and false confession?
And most importantly, will we be voting in the middle of the term for Congress to hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, a long dark night awaits democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me on the Sabbath to light candles on a table with a swastika.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the confrontation with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers on Thursday host Rapid Vienna with the knowledge that winning over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month would give them great hope for progress from the Group G European League.
A knee injury prevented backer Graham Dorrans from appearing on the pitch for the first time in the season until a 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game with the belief that we could pull something out, and we took the point.
We may have been able to multiply it in the end, but overall the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we improved and we were better again.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can score three points, but it's going to be hard, because they played a good result in the last game. But with the spectators behind us, I'm sure we can push and it will go well.
Last year was pretty hard, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it here.
The team is strong and the guys are really enjoying it, the training is also great.
I hope that we can stand up now, throw last season behind us and be successful.”
Women Worry About Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people spoke to family members about it.
Approximately half of the people in the nationwide study said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t want to discuss it with him,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for care unless you tell them your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be funded with traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance to help you pay for these expenses, or with your own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have the money.
Create your own legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as you can.
Identify a health care representative, who will be a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that doctors comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also consider writing down the full power for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure the payment of your accounts in case you are not eligible to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your grandparent necessarily needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to get you ready.
“It’s not just finances in the game, but, for example, what are the names of the attending physicians?” asks Martin.
“Where are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready at hand.’

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, adding that the death toll is expected to increase.
As communications are off, the auxiliary units were unable to obtain any information from the Donggal regency, which is an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the coast on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has hit Palu and Donggal several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, the Donggala tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and there are regular earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake hit the Pidia Jaya regency in Aceh province and caused destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastating effects of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 died from falling buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reporting and preventing arrest.
According to the police report, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin picked up her phone.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained on an unsecured bond of $500.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt "definitely innocent" when asked to comment.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a Class B offense, which is punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before an Alaskan court for war veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with domestic violence reporting and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by groups of war veterans for associating her son’s violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of operation and the number of casualties is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake hit a portion of Sulawesi island northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos showing the moment of disaster appeared.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Exceptional Death Penalty for Suspect of NYC Terror Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – an exceptional punishment that has not been awarded for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly attacked a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October using a rented Home Depot truck to sweep away pedestrians and cyclists.
To defend the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries – this is how the terms of the intent to grant the death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to court documents, both these numbers would mean the possibility of granting the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including charges of murder in favor of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and preparation,” claim the plaintiffs, describing the way Saipov committed the act as “disgusting, cruel and perverted.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadtová, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damianuvá."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the Southern District of New York last sentenced to death.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, was executed, proving a conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs sat in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal remorse, according to court documents, during the days and months following the attack.
Police said he felt good about what he had done.
Saipov allegedly told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching Islamic State videos on the phone.
Police also said they demanded that the Islamic State flag be hoisted in a hospital room.
He said he feels innocent of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and serving a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for anyone concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's lawyers had previously asked the prosecutor not to demand the death penalty.
MEPs of the Conservative Party should be entrusted with Brexit negotiations NIGEL FARAGE
During today’s protest at the Conservative Party conference, Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the army of the people.”
The former leader of the UK’s Independence Party has said politicians must “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics – as one of its own MEPs, Theresa May, suggested – should be the negotiator with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would “be out now” if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But the problem that May faces in reconciling her ranks, where there is a deep rift, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting for retention in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister tries to keep her Chequers compromise plan running under the attacks of Brexit supporters, EU supporters and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said Leave Means Leave would gather in Solihull, where he wanted to "kick out at Chequers."
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out today,” he said.
MEP Wellingborough added: “I will stand for Brexit, but we have to give up on Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight world wars to have to obey.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone has rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is completely misguided.’
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, and he is not liked by members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be elected at all.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report to Mrs May, she says, “Ministerial prime ministers will keep their seats when they keep their promises.”
Farage said conservative politicians must “get into an awkward situation” if they want to betray their decision based on the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re standing here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do this.’”
He added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has secured our victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Great Britain that governs itself.”
Proponents of staying in the Union, meanwhile, marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists were waving banners to the Conservatives against Brexit after the party’s opening weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives over problems with the party's application security after the conference began.
“These are people who, in their own words, can secure IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Rethink’ Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will “consider her candidacy for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is trying to get re-election in November against Republican deputy Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s action in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to apply for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time had come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which meant a woman at the top.
Suspect Arrested for Shooting LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they had detained a suspect in Friday's shooting of LSU basketball player Wayda Simse.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. at the ET news conference.
A video of Friday's shooting was released requesting the identification of the man caught on the tape.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that was not life-consistent,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, carrying a gun, and also confessing to the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot and 6-inch Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, of which 10 were last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of World Champion when the team director gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished in Saturday’s qualifying against Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes’ team management would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the pole position and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the depot and let Hamilton catch up with the cars running around the group's tail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider drove into the depot a round later and after the exit he ran for Vettel. However, Hamilton moved forward and in a tight fight, the Ferrari rider had to reluctantly leave the inner lane free in order to defend himself in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen left the rear row of the field and at the end of the first round he was in the lead on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race because he held the original tyres for as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and be able to take Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
Eventually he entered the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight laps he was no longer able to increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday’s meeting for insisting she didn’t publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at the West Virginia assembly, he did not directly mention Ford’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead stating that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil and disgusting and lying.”
"One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see that anger, when you see these people being angry and evil and disgusting and lying," he said.
“When you look at the publication and the publication and they say to you, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, can you take the leak?
Remember her answer... you published the document – ah, ah, what?
Oh, no.
Not published."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... No, no," he added, mimicking the senator.
The Feinsteins sent Ford a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and the information leaked in early September — but Feinstein denied that there would be a leak from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose the information on the case," Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep everything a secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do.”
However, her words seem to disbelieve the president, who spoke about the case at the meeting on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this is a really bad body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but anyway, it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend a Supreme Court judge candidate accused by three women of sexual harassment, and hinted that the Democrats are using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power back by whatever means are available.
“You see this vileness, this disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to punch in the ground to get back to power and to the helm,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars corrected Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's retaliation in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took the lead thanks to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to make up for the home run before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard then matched Dundee again, after which two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who managed to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
Both teams met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous games controlled by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendall McFaull's assist, while David Rutherford scored for Beauvillier's second assist four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back in time at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt set a goal for Cownie, who was comparing in time at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants only went into the cockpit for the first break in the lead when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The homers regrouped and Bouchard managed to equalize the goal from the overweight game again in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's joint work later helped Nielsen overtake Dundee in the second-third for the first time in the match, and the same player secured his team's lead in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost their fourth of the last five games, will play another game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air Traffic Manager Died to Allow Hundreds of People on Board to Escape Earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero after he died while overseeing the aircraft with hundreds of people on board to safely take off.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake caused by the tsunami on Friday on Sulawesi Island.
Severe aftershocks flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that colleagues of twenty-one-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his seat in the wildly waning control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped down from the control tower as he thought he was moving down.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, told ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which transported him to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities have expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster management said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase as many bodies remain undamaged under the wreckage and many of them have still not been reached by rescuers," Sutopo Purwo Nugro, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
The waves in the devastated Palu have reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft carry aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies here.
There is a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are stolen everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now claims one person missing after plane crash in a lagoon in Micronesia
The airline operating the flight that crashed into a lagoon on one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific has now reported that one person is missing, initially stating that all passengers and crew of a total of 47 people were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that she was unable to find one passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details about the passenger, his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before landing.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
"That was terribly good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and others managed to get water through a deep belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He added that the crew panicked and screamed, and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers working near the dock repairs helped rescue passengers by using an inflatable boat they were transporting to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft crashes over the past two decades, but no accident has occurred with Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday ended its speech in this case in which a man is repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury drew a script for how he used records from the 29 cell phone of defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers' company on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous statement, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data from his cell phone showed that he had spent the night with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was visited by the police.
Sanford stood before the council court and testified that the day in question was not in the city.
When the plaintiffs asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said he was “lies because my car was in Nashville that night.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
However, the phone records say the two had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He completely wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band High Breed claims that hip hop has shifted since its inception with political messages and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and re-popularize conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have already experienced a revival in the recent past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
New York Nurse Sues Couple for Dismissal After ‘Racist’ Text Message
A New York nurse sues the couple for her discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneous text message from her mother labeling her as “another black woman” in a text message.
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed horror when she discovered on her first day at work in 2016 that her children’s new educator, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
“NOW, OTHER BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
When she understood her fake passport, Plasco-Flaxman, a “concerned” woman, fired Maurice, saying that her African-American educator was working really badly when she was leaving, and that she was expecting a Philippines instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal and is seeking compensation of $350 per day of six-month engagement for which she was initially hired, even if without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not being done,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
However, the couple retaliated by saying that they were not racist, but that the termination of Mrs. Maurice’s employment was an appropriate measure because they feared that they could no longer trust her after that insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
“But would you give your child into the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “extortion” and said his wife only cared for a two-month-old child and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Would you drive for someone like that?
That's not a nice thing at all," said the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, a jury on social media has very quickly condemned the couple for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of the story of the bear Paddington feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, reveals the latest news
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s acceptance, told the reporter: “It’s hard to feel the situation of someone reading it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s very fun to know now that we already know Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, adding on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a "sweet-bitter" point after his death.
To Paddington, who she describes as a "very important member of her family," she added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man, he was never flattering," she said.
“But because Paddington was such a real figure for him, it was like having a child who achieved something you can really be proud of.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all the successes only to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
“Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn’t expect her to get out of it,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
So I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart running slowly lost its effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly afterwards, and it was as if everything had ended.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without revealing the difficult test she is currently undergoing.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head bent, tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt an astonishing comprehension of Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Women Send Postcards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women, who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide, work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out postcards of the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can look for support on.
Mrs. Davis’ son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and as a result took his life at 18.
“I don’t want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up every room."
However, before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his sibling’s immobile body after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about how it will affect his life."
Ms Davis proposed a postcard “to inform people that they have people at their disposal who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they are their friends.
Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies's long-time girlfriend, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he felt down or depressed, nothing at all,” he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we then observed a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Day, when the kids opened the gifts and didn’t even look at them, nothing.”
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that she had to get over it gradually: “This kind of thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It's ripped us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we could get something he was actually asking for - a time-limited investigation, with a limited scope - we could bring a little unity to it," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "disintegrate" because the two parties were pushed back.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans go as expected, it will lead to their drastic weakening in attempts to push the man they want into the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush telephoned senators, lobbying in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles its report?
The Senate will vote on it, and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which has allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the draw and confirm it with the Supreme Court.
North Korea's refugee numbers 'decline' after Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since the beginning of Kim Jong-Un’s rule seven years ago, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Byeong-seug Park, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there had been 1,127 escapes in the past year — compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park added that there were stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates of smuggling at the border.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are now being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, with which North Korea has the longest border, and it is easier to cross it than in the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the halting of denuclearization talks.
This took place at the historic June meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive terms of cooperation on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho on Saturday accused the United States of making no progress on sanctions.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way for us to be unilaterally disarmed," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve at the Supreme Court due to his temperament.
Pelosi made the remark in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but call it 'hysterical' if any woman ever performed such a theatre," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's Thursday statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed all accusations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while both were still in their puberty.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying their accusations against him were a “grotesque and coordinated attack” by liberals who failed to pass through Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s resignation proved he was unable to work for the Supreme Court because he showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question whether she would seek Kavanaugh's appeal if he were confirmed, even if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll tell you this – if he’s not telling Congress the truth, then he’s not only eligible to work at the Supreme Court, but also at the court he’s working on right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential returns in court under the Acceptable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings leading up to his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would reverse some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There’s no time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to just say, ‘Oh, that’s beautiful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to govern it.
After months, months and years of frustration, she couldn’t get rid of it without crying.
“We cry when we have anger,” Mrs. Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A woman who worked as a director told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which means that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m crying with.
But I'm angry."
And so she went on.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office dominated by men. Once there I expressed my inexpressible anger with tears. But the older, always cold manager, whom I always worried a bit, grabbed me by the neck and shoe.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea for her own presidential candidacy.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with laughter after 30 years.
“There were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had been going on for a long time at the time, she was unable to keep up with earning contributions, so she pledged not to get into the fight if she didn’t earn $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Does she think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overwhelmed by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it harder for her to get money and focusing on voters rather than delegates and anger at sexism that you were completely proud of.
"You might think I've collapsed nervously," Mrs. Schroeder said of how the press reacted to her.
“And maybe you would think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my gravestone.
"Crying"?
Why the Sino-American Trade War May Be Good for Beijing
The initial salvage of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the rift between countries is beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
However, most of the most significant escalations saw the light of day this week, when new tariffs were announced on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which practically means taxing half of trade exports from China to the US.
Beijing has responded each time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of US imports of $60 billion.
China has tried to repay the United States with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will fall to its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original tracks, that would mean retreating from its demands, but public submission to U.S. demands would be absolutely humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, a trade war on the part of the US could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact is that Washington’s or Beijing’s swift political decisions could create economic conditions that would trigger economic turmoil in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have admitted so far,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the Center for New American Think Tank.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation on the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as the unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives, are now being met.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in need of humanitarian aid in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance to build a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the insurgents.
Europe responded vigorously to the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Evria won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of difficulty in France.
The United States has now lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil, so it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who spent most of the tour, then fired the ball into the water on 3 pairs of 16th holes and let Francesco Molinari win.
Italian golfer Molinari then shined in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best score 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-rated European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest-rated player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who apparently took his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain’s Sergio Garcia has become the best European player overall with 25.5 points earned in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy that I got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after winning Europe.
He gave the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The odd stats of one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 of the greatest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's unsatisfactory results: "I'm proud of those guys, they really fought.
This morning we really warmed Europe to the heart.
We really didn't make it.
I bow my hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really need to squeeze.
You've lost us."
Red tide update: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to an overall drop in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, spots of blooming water are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – indicating a decreasing concentration.
The blooming water of the red tide spans about 130 miles of coastline from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
Spots were observed about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week there were relatively fewer spots.
The red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
In the Hillsborough district, low to high concentrations were observed in the high seas, the lowest to high concentrations in the Manatee district, the lowest to high concentrations in the low seas, the lowest to high concentrations in the low seas, the lowest to high concentrations in the low seas, the highest concentrations in the low seas, the highest concentrations in the low seas, the highest concentrations in the low seas and the low seas.
Respiratory irritation continues to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory tract irritation was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
