Welsh MPs worry they'll be confused with Mappets
Some Members expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This concern arose in relation to the plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
MEPs across the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that he would "make a similar deal with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "stupid" and the word "pwp" means "stupid".
A member of parliament for the Plaids said the party as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his party was "open-minded" about changing the name, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "mapet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to Yorkshire's English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill to adopt the name change, said: "The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will, of course, be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for naming Parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
As far as the title of Members is concerned, the Commission was in favour of the name "Wales Member of Parliament" or WMP, but the choice of MWP was the one that received the most support during the public consultation.
MEPs are obviously proposing alternative options, but trying to reach consensus can be a difficult matter for Parliament's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the next few months.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the way the parliament operates, including rules for derogating from the parliamentary office and the design of the committee system.
MEPs will decide in the final vote on the question of their names during the discussion of the legislation.
The citizens of Macedonia come to the polls for the referendum on the change of the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people’s vote was called for in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that its northern neighbor’s name conceals territorial ambitions and has repeatedly objected to its requests for membership in the EU and NATO.
Georgi Ivanov, the president of Macedonia, a fighter in the referendum on the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change is simply the price they have to pay for their membership in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have been silenced as the churches in Harlem disappear.
"The older people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church in every corner," Adams said.
Today, there is none of them.”
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
“The world is socializing differently today,” he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood 'salon' where people regularly frequent."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the authorities hope “and sooner or later they will return to the place where they started.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by condominiums filled with people who would not be willing to help the remaining worship sites in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will rush the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all those people who will move to these apartments will become white."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation withdrew in the 1930s.
A black church that was located in the vicinity took over the building.
The occupation of the St. Martin building was taken over by a black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted the stores of 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which they refused to hire or sell.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners took over the rebuilding and ordered the cauldron.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July described it in a different way: “a cultural treasure” and “a substitute instrument of historical importance”.
Tiffany In from the University of Michigan also noted that she was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lydd, who was transferred to a larger carillon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Maryweather said St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
What’s happening in recent months in St. Martin is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the church’s popular leaders, while others by the diocese.
The commissioners - the administrative body of the parish, consisting of the people's leaders - sent a letter to the diocese in July about their concerns that the diocese "would seek to transfer the cost" to the commissioners' body, despite the fact that this did not interfere with the commissioners' body.
Some parishioners expressed complaints about the lack of transparency on the bishops’ side.
13-Year-Old Shark Attacked While Diving for Lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster fishing dive in California on the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of the child asking for help and approached skating with a team to get him out of the water.
Hamel said at first he thought it was just screams of excitement because he caught a lobster, but then he realized he was yelling, "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
His entire key had been opened,” Hamel remarked when he arrived at the boy’s location.
“I called out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the sea!’”
The boy was airlifted to Randy's Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Rescuer Larry Giles said in a press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was not believed to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim has serious injuries on the upper part of the torso.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Bis in Casampland to Swamis in Ensinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's designs put pressure on UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by placing cosmetics shelves corresponding to those of department stores, run by specialist employees.
In the context of the significant rise in the UK cosmetics market, which amounts to <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household items are falling, the largest cosmetics shelves will be placed on the shelves and tested in 11 stores.
Investment in the cosmetics sector comes as supermarkets look for a way to replenish the space on the shelves that used to occupy televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series will also be given more shelf space with the company's logo, similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is re-launching its own Boutique makeup line so that most products are vegan – something that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will try to sell its products at two Sainsbury's stores, one that opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the other in Shelly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy small amounts of food every day in local mini-markets means that supermarkets will have to make more efforts to get people to visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlet stores will increasingly resemble department stores as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more off-food services.
Sainsbury's put Argos outlet stores in hundreds of stores, while also importing some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renovate the cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how profits from pharmacy stores were distributed to the chain's supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores at Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds will play its own role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our shelves in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to meet every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a possible destination for cosmetics that challenges the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones: furious after Holly Williamby's departure from the <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
The protagonist of the series Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is furious after television presenter Holly Willoughby left the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with the lifestyle business she owns in order to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Williamby doesn't have time for the Truly apparel and accessories company.
Their business was compared to the Goop company of Guinett Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of the show, This Morning, announced on Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Willoughby exasperated the Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute in order to devote herself to her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden girl of television admitted during a meeting full of tensions on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that because of her newlyweds he would not be able to attend.
The company was compared to Guinett Paltrow's Goop company and appears to have doubled Williams' estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11m worth of assets.
After 37-year-old Williamby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew outside the UK to one of his holiday homes.
According to a source, “Truly was far from Holly Williamby’s top priorities.
It was about its long-term future, its source of revenue for the coming decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There's a warehouse full of products at headquarters in Marlowe ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the departure of the presenter of the show "This Morning", which is among the most commercial celebrities in Britain, could cost the company millions due to its huge investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes and articles.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have maintained close friendships with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Williamby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couples are spending their holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Williams is set to become the central figure in M&S' campaigns and replace Ad McPartlin in the show "I'm A Celebrity" on ITV.
A source from Jones's close environment said last night, "We don't want to comment on his professional affairs."
We were tough "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media about a comment that some would consider inappropriate to a president, as well as his so positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said he imitated the telecongressman's style.
"I forgave nothing."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ray Yong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea's "nowhere to go" in the near future.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
"We were almost at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have built this excellent relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - ending missile tests, releasing the hostages and returning the remaining U.S. soldiers to their homes.
While he supported his unusual stance on statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have 'presidential' style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the hall because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing at the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep an entire island, leaving thousands dead on their way
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was announced that it would not require the assistance of foreign non-governmental organizations.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a necessary condition for the use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is quite difficult," Ms. Subung said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international organizations would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the seismic vibrations that often strike Indonesia, the country remains bitterly unprepared against the rage of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not the same on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of an alarm siren for a tsunami in Palu, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters further complicate the administration’s work.
A floating hospital that had been stationed in Lombok to care for the victims of the quake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo was at the heart of his election campaign to improve Indonesia’s disorganized infrastructure, and he deployed generous funds to build roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding haunts Joko’s administration before his re-election next year.
Joko is also under pressure from persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets, using knives, bows and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Steritz draws a tie against Chelsea
Daniel Steritz saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steritz took a pass from Serdan Shakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and jumped on the back pole.
His effort was driven very high from the large area and ended up on the right in the nets.
The ball eventually fell over Kepa Arizambalaga who jumped to repel it and got into the nets.
"I was trying to get this position, to get to the ball and players like Shakiri are always playing as much forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," he told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Candet approaching, I made a direct switch, I didn't think about it very much, and I did the shot."
Chelsea had the lead 1-0 in the half after the goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Azar.
The blue striker gave the heel to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before giving a kick near the center of the field and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> did one and two in the center of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Azar to the large area.
Azar ran ahead of the defender and finished by sending the ball to the nets on the back pole with a left shot in front of Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the debris of the buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-degree earthquake that struck the area on Friday and created waves of 6 meters in height, said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Puruo Press.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the debris of the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man After Murdering Woman With Knife
A murder investigation began after the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mills on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police asked the locals who saw or heard something to report it to the police.
Officer Bryan O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I would like to appeal to anyone in the neighborhood around John Street who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in the footage from the dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have information in their possession that is vital to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon friends who think they may know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway as police say they are in the process of informing their closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mills, in an attempt to return to his apartment, has been informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that it may take hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared with tears on the scene.
He kept saying, "It's awful."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the police tape and one outside.
Cops were standing outside the tape and watching the apartment building.
Anyone with any information is kindly requested to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers line anonymously at 0800 555 111 for Case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument to be hit by the controversy over the "rewriting of history"
His exorcism would constitute poetic justice for the Talibanist destruction of numerous cultural and religious works of England by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
Cromwell, however, described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In this discussion about the removal of statues, it was inevitable not to target the form of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace.
The iconoclasm of England's civil wars was neither dictated nor executed by Cromwell.
Possibly, the wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas’ ancestor in the previous century.
Cromwell’s outstanding portrayal of Sir William Hamo Thornicroft is characteristic of his image during the 19th century and part of the historiography of a personality that many believe is worthy of tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an absolutely accurate case is the subject of an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that the conflicts in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is an identifiable personality that represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also commendable and memorable.”
Pig Killer Injures Deadly Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, to whom only the surname "Uan" was given, was found with a cut artery inside a blood lake near a pig market in Liaoning's Liaoning market in the province of Guizhou, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
An employee at a pig farm is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005 in Zhining in Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a neighboring pig farm open.
He said there was a large male pig in the swine herd with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kilograms had fatally wounded the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's legs were slain and crippled," the cousin, known by his nickname "Woo", said in the evening's Guiyang news release.
Security camera footage shows Wan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wan or his cousin.
A market official said in the evening news bulletin that the pig had been placed in a cage so as not to attack anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 295-pound pig threw a farmer in Wales on his tractor until his farmer's wife frightened the animal away.
After the incident in which an Oregon farmer was slaughtered by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of the blood can act as a "smell."
“They’re just in a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We just have to show them the proper respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are going to bring extensive rainfall in the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder water masses of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Hurricane Rosa's wind power reached 85 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a region of low wind pressure has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward towards the U.S. West Coast. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will
Hurricane Rosa will bring 25 centimetres of rainfall to areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching low wind pressure region will create extensive heavy rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 centimeters will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates approaching 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour at locations, particularly in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 centimeters is expected locally in the Southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is advisable to avoid any walking in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can turn the gorges into rushing rivers and storms will cause locally strong winds and sandstorms.
The low wind pressure area will create some locally strong local rainfall on the southern California coastline.
Total rainfall height of more than 1 centimeter is possible, which can cause small flows of debris and slippage on the roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the area.
Some scattered tropical bores will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday mornings, before the phenomena expand late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the Fore Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be some intense temperature changes across the U.S. as temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in the tropical zones they remain quite high.
Sometimes, this fact leads to very intense temperature changes over close distances.
A typical example of the intense temperature differences between the central U.S. was observed on Sunday.
There was a nearly 10-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., October is expected to start with high temperatures at 27°C from the eastern plains to parts of the southeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 27°C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a fair chance that temperatures above the average in the Eastern U.S. will be observed by the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million viewers watched the defamatory testimony of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, Thursday, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Beale.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with television networks interrupting the normal flow of the program to overturn the last minute on Friday: the agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee she was 100 percent sure that at a high school party, Cavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a loaded statement, said he was 100 percent sure that such a thing had not happened.
According to Nielsen’s measurements, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers watched the hearing on Friday.
The company calculated the average view on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately made available to other broadcasting networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office space.
Let’s see this TV show in the right dimensions, it’s a common size analogous to watching a football game of the play-offs or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News, whose journalists strongly supported Cavanaugh’s appointment, was ahead of an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
They were followed by CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high even after the audition.
Fleick turned out to be the protagonist in Friday's drama.
Following the Republican moderate’s statement that he would vote in favor of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded protesters disapproving of him as he tried to enter the elevator for a hearing by the Justice Committee.
He stood with his eyes low for several minutes as they disapproved of him, live on CNN television.
"I stand here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Fleik said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors closed, he would have more to say at the Commission hearing.
All cable television and broadcasting networks were covered live a few hours later, the Senate Justice Committee’s vote on the promotion of Cavanaugh’s candidacy to the Senate Plenary for a vote.
However, Fleick said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, a request made by a minority of Democrats.
Fleick was partly persuaded after discussions with his friend, Democratic Party Senator Chris Cohns.
After discussions with Koons and some other senators then, Fleick was decided.
Fleick's choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not gather the votes for Cavanaugh's approval without conducting an investigation.
President Trump has asked the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview along with her own on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson has sharply criticized the Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal to collect tariffs between Britain and the EU was “completely absurd.”
Wade Simms Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dateon Simpson for Murdering Player at LSU
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dateon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, according to Baton Rouge police station.
The authorities have in their hands a video of Simms' clash with Simson and according to police Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police spotted the glasses at the crime scene and said they found traces of Simpson's DNA, according to the WAFB, which is working with CBS.
Following Simson's interrogation, police said they had admitted that he had fatally wounded Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by the East Baton Rouge coroner released on Friday, the cause of death is a bullet wound to the head and neck.
The department has put at the disposal of Louisiana Police a special task force, the police’s forensic laboratory, the police forces of the Southern University and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation for the arrest.
LSU sports director Joey Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “investigation and pursuit of justice.”
Simms was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-tall forward grew up Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "depressed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“We’re always worried about incidents like this,” Wade said.
Emissions of volcanic ash in Mexico City
Emissions of volcanic ash from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexico’s residents on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after activity on the crater reached its peak, recording 183 gas and ash emissions in a 24-hour period.
The Center monitored various signs and small seismic vibrations.
Images on social media show car windshields covered with thin ash layers in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan separatists in view of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a clash of pro-independence protesters with the rehabilitation units, as thousands took part in the demonstrations for the first anniversary of the vote on Catalonia's secession that provoked
A group of masked independence protesters, held back by the order’s rehabilitation units, fired eggs and paint into dust, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Complications were also noted later during the day with police officers using their clubs to suppress the clashes.
For hours, groups of Catalan independence supporters shouted the slogan “We do not forgive, we do not forget” against groups of protesters in favor of the unity of the country who shouted “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were hospitalized with micro-injuries that occurred during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region that supports independence a year after Madrid's October 1 referendum declared it illegal, which is still celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although the turnout was low with anti-independence voters boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police authorities tried to interrupt voting at polling stations in the area where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups encamped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration of support from the national police.
The protest took place but was forced to take a different turn.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the independence demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy who managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnating,” he said.
Despite the fact that they scored a vital victory in the regional elections of last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders finding themselves self-appointed or expelled.
Joan Putsch, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded protests in favor of the police with his cell phone, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
“The tension is escalating more and more,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned last year, announced his candidacy for the European elections next year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the stifling of democratic values and the oppression we have received from the Spanish government," he said.
London: Arrest of man after car crash in residence
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being repeatedly hit by a car in a London residence.
The incident took place in Bollinagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blamings said damage had been caused to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's hit gave Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by giving Steven Gerard just his second defeat in the 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox Group.
Dolly Menga's hit made a difference as Gary Holt's side shifted level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains out of the league this season without a win and faces the Harts, who have the eight-point lead, next Sunday.
Before this match, the Rangers are hosting Rapidus Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, continues invinciblely her race in six games in her class, with head coach Holt not yet tasted any defeats since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
“Livingston is losing opportunities to visitors.
Holt’s team should have taken the lead long before scoring, with its immediacy putting the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson took the lead and nearly reached the finish line, but Alan Lithgow pushed back his effort by sliding Craig Halkett's head away from the finish line.
The pitchers willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could drag visitors into free kicks and corners.
And that’s how the big goal came.
The Rangers were unable to stop a free kick and Livingstone made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to send the ball to Menga, who took the pass and scored from the center of the area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball but found the defense of the pitchers impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos pushed the ball away from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was knocked off the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow's pass came out on another free kick from Livingston.
Many vertical passes were made in the Livingston area and were constantly rejected, while two penalties were requested - after the ball was claimed by Hulkett against substitute Glenn Middleton and one by hand - which were rejected.
"Excellent game" from Livingston - analysis
Alan Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Dramatic performance and results for Livingston.
All of them, without exception, were excellent, exceeding expectations in this upward course.
Their playing style and personality changed little after their return to top form, but the credits should also be given to Holt for the push he gave to the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Hulkett was excellent, recruiting a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joey Warell on guard throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, had no inspiration.
As good as they were in the past under the guidance of Gerard, they did not meet these standards.
Their last game was short - only once they managed to pass the defense of the pitchers and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed emotions at Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the heads of state of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had come into disrepair on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest community of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police have blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have managed to get close to their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them of Kurdish origin - also attended, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The division of the protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor who is treated by some Turks as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Road accident in Detford: death of cyclist after collision with a car
A cyclist lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The collision occurred a few months after a similar incident in which a driver hit and abandoned a cyclist, who lost his life on Childers Street, about 1 mile (1.6 km) from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are making efforts to identify the man and to inform their closest relatives about the incident.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartine Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Clashes
Six police officers were injured in riots that erupted in the prisons of high-security men, according to the Prison Directorate.
Riots broke out at His Majesty's Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Tornado special police forces have been deployed to deal with the riots involving eight detainees and which took place in one wing.
The police were hospitalized with micro-injuries in the face during the clashes.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained personnel took charge of dealing with the incident at His Majesty’s Long Lartin prisons.
Six members of the staff were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may be subject to a higher sentence.”
More than 500 prisoners are detained in the prisons of His Majesty Long Lartin, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison administration was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, law enforcement units were called to the prison to suppress serious incidents that erupted, during which staff members were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical recession to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwestern parts of the desert, bringing floods to their passage.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to south and east Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the U.S. state of California, U.S.A., and U.S.A.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass right over the Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or low-barometric state less than 200 miles from the Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict rainfall heights of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rainfall volumes of up to 6 inches in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
In other areas of the Southwestern States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, it is likely to experience rainfall heights of 1 to 2 inches, with the likelihood of individual total rainfall volumes of up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain that Rosa brings can be a blessing, as the area is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwest states are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest drought class,” weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Maintaining the hurricane’s intensity, Rosa will be 385 miles south of Mexico’s Punta Eugenia with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning and will move north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and, therefore, will weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to reach land in Mexico with a tropical storm intensity in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
There may be heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall volumes of the order of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baha California to northwestern Sonora, which are likely to reach up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north crossing Mexico as a tropical storm now and will reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometric, which will then pass through Arizona’s vault to reach the southern lands.
"The main danger expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is the very heavy rainfall in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern U.S. states," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and mudslides in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted homicide after a 16-year-old was found carrying a knife wound to Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Exelsior Monster area of Midsomer Northon, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in a "steady" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Randstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are calling for anyone who may have videotaped what happened on their mobile phone to be present.
Trump said Cavanaugh had "lived the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party.
“The vote in favor of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said Cavanaugh had "lived the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of running for president.
Cavano filed in Congress on Thursday, categorically and with apparent emotion denying Christine Blaise Ford's allegations that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also pleaded before a hearing for her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw the greatness, quality, and courage” of Cavanaugh that day.
“The vote to confirm Judge Cavanaugh’s candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent course of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s candidacy, while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but it’s actually like I am,” he said.
“That’s why I’m traveling everywhere supporting outstanding candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The Senate’s first major procedural vote on Cavano’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant chief of the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of them driven by giant waves that swept the coasts, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palos on Friday, when waves of six meters high hit the shore at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 Richter earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately, so they were hit by it," said Sutopo Purgoo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster management agency.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, wood, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster management agency show many damaged buildings and shops, bridges that have been twisted and collapsed, and a temple surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He said that heaps of victims were found trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the center of the quake.
The communication systems "completely paralyzed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had reached the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard screaming panicked trying to warn people down the road about the tsunami that is coming.
Within a few minutes, a water wall clashes on the coast, dragging homes and cars.
The Reuters news agency was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which also disrupted communications in the wider area of Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but displaced people still desperately need food and other basic first-aid items.
The city’s airport reopened only to contribute to the relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
Despite the fact that staff of World Vision from Dongala managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where workers found refuge in accommodations from canvases set up in their office yard, they went through scenes of disaster on their way, Mr. Doze said.
"They told me they saw a lot of damaged houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief groups have undertaken the sad task of starting the relief process for the injured, some have complained that foreign, particularly experienced aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the site of a disaster is declared a zone of national destruction.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says it’s a national disaster, we can apply for international assistance, but there’s no decision yet.”
As the second day in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of those still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less bleak.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a ditch.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days, next to her mother's dead body.
Ghent Subadono, the head coach of Indonesia’s national parachute team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaji, were his students.
“As an elder in the parachute slope sport, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Guenton recounted how, when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paratroopers’ community came out, he began sending desperate WhatsApp messages to his opponents in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, the sign next to his messages was a gray "n" symbol, instead of two blue.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves seized $26,750 while supplying an automatic pick-up machine to Newport on the Levy.
On Friday morning, thieves snatched $26,750 from a Brink employee who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Left, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had evacuated an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Yee
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Yee.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being who is officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long listened to the caressing Son and used this nickname as a title on his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album titled Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the professional name he uses today, West had previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West said earlier this year in a discussion about the title of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, our confused self, of everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known by various names, such as Paf Duddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, JEI-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without pauses and capital letters.
Mexico’s President-elect vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student repression.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence (AI)
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. will have to double the amount it spends on research in this field, says investor and AI professional Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Apple, Google and Google.
This comment comes in addition to announcements by various parts of the U.S. government on artificial intelligence, as the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence overall.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled its plan to become the world’s first country to innovate in AI by 2030.
"Double the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking to make the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of the budget could double the odds that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book titled "Sincours' AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) has been published this month by Micouth,
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the best American player Othello, while later he was an executive executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's appendix in China.
Lee acknowledged the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotic Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place to identify the next visions.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to receive state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that gets the best of the academic space, it’s the companies,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired authorities from universities to work on AI issues in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that a green card should be automatically offered to PhD holders in artificial intelligence,” he said.
The State Council of China adopted a Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people at academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other governmental organizations, respectively, which donates money to U.S. researchers, researchers, and other non-governmental organizations.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will be joined by partners from business and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee for the Defense of the United States.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 million annually in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, there has been no progress in U.S. legislation for months with the goal of setting up a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country’s name
The people of Macedonia took part in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country will be renamed "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long disagreement with Greece that had blocked the country's candidacy for membership in the European Union.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the northern neighbor country represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov has said he will not take part in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether participation will reach the required 50 percent to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot was: "You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece".
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO for the Macedonian independence, one of the countries that emerged from the conflict.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will make our lives safer,” said Oliviera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several Members of Parliament have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote in order to make it final.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Elections Committee said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout reached just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when it was given by 66 percent of registered voters.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Jose Tanevsky, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in the referendum on the change of the name of the country that would open the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union in the city.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small tent and places chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads high, not as second-class partners," Kavardárkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favor, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a positive outcome would be “the confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV television station, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its rise to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero passes Brighton’s entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling finished Brighton's defense by scoring a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed that he scored easily in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker took the pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Brighton defenders before he spilled into the open space.
Afterwards, Aguero was found surrounded by four green players.
He passed one defensive dribble, then escaping several others on the edge of the large area of Brighton.
Then, he gave all to his left, finding Sterling.
English forward made his first move in the area by returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to defeat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, scoring on the right side of the nets.
“Agüero is facing some problems in his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the City’s coach, told reporters.
"We said to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage at the Battle of the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep into the area of Brighton at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left-hand side to Leroy Sané.
Sane held the ball in his possession and guided Sterling to the back pole.
The Forward of the Blues kicked the ball into the nets just before it came out.
City will face Hofenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sergeant Sergeant wants to defeat the Rockies.
As the Nyasionals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the ever-competitive Sergeant hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still repercussions for the Rockies in the play-offs as they advance in a Los Angeles Dodgers game in the National League West.
The Rockies have gone into the playoffs with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock in the first place in their class.
“Although we have nothing to win, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will be a game probably of the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to fight in such a fight?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the original striker on Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Sherzer drop the ball.
Serger, who will make his 34th start, made practice throws on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is normally a day off for him.
The right-hander from Washington has a performance of 18-7 with an average winning points (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 outs due to strikes in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trump is delivering a speech in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding his elected candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in his speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
"This is a very important moment, I'm not a candidate, but in reality it's like I am, and that's why I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this miserable, miserable radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary. You see the evil, the misery.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to exterminate to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
"And you've seen this in the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "angry and evil, miserable and liars."
He was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by making naming references to Democratic Senator Diane Finstein, a report that was accepted with strong public disapproval.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you unveil the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, oh no, I'm waiting for an answer. This was a really ugly use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad party.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
I was not surprised at all that activists of the Momentum movement in my local group voted to take revenge on me.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs to whom they have been told that they are not welcome, precisely because we are saying our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion of censure was criticized because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, paradoxically, on issues similar to those on which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Workers' meeting on Friday said that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings on Friday evening were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate, more compassionate" policy has long been forgotten if it ever really began to be implemented.
It is increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I previously thought we had similar political views began to expect from me to make a 180 degree turn and adopt views with which I would never agree, whether they concern national security.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I was really saying, I heard a hymn on social media, where some asked for my rejection, rejected the policy of the center and told me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues, as the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but they never give in.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how insults are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance, and that it should be a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad faction and that with every motion of censure or change in the rules of selection, the party’s boundaries narrow.
I have been advised many times in the last two years not to raise my head, not to talk too much and that so "everything will be okay".
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student still, because of the negligence shown by the Thatcher government which literally led to the failure of my entire class, my purpose was to defend better public services of the government as a minister for those who need them most, as a member.
I never hid my politics, and I did the same in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way about my political views and my points of disagreement with today’s leadership.
To those who put forward the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is facing a Brexit that will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the project.
But, really, my only message is not to the members of the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political feasibility will prevent me from doing so.

Air - Melrose: 38 - 17: Invincible Air rises to the top
Two late goals may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ire deserved to triumph in this extremely entertaining today’s Tennessee championship game.
He is now at the top of the rankings, the only unbeaten team out of ten.
Ultimately, it was her superior defense, as well as the best use of opportunities, that raised the scales in favor of the pitchers and coach Peter Murcy had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to IR, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
Grand Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, with a Fraser Climax conversion, brought Ire ahead, but a yellow card to the Scottish Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to split.
Clima increased Ire's lead by a penalty, before scoring, just in the middle, a goal by a conversion, leading Ire to the locker room with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Baggot's conversion, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruarid Noot, who was removed by a stretcher, and, after the restart, Ire further increased the difference with a goal from Stafford Macdonald, with a climate conversion.
Deputy Chief Blair McPherson then took a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of Bruce Colvin's numerical advantage with a goal without a conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The pitchers came back, however, and when Strawan Hutchinson took a yellow card for tackling the climate without the ball, from the penalty line, McPherson scored a goal at the back of the Iris attack.
Clima made a conversion, as he did again almost since the restart, after Kylie Rowe first picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent extreme Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the pitchers.
Still Game Protagonist Starts New Career in Focus
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to jump into the catering industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and in which he co-stars with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hebfield.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth series will also be the last of the show, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Geigland.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wants to deal with the "blooming industry of dining" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Surrounded Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the fully equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, blue flags are waved.
At the base of the navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is written the slogan: "Our sea belongs rightfully.
It is our duty to take her back.”
Throughout land-locked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that Chile conquered after a bloody conflict over the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to still travel.
These hopes have been resurrected today more than ever, for decades, as Bolivia awaits the ruling of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has the dynamism, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course awaits the result with a positive outlook," said Roberto Calzantilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim to be forced to leave Chile after decades of unstable talks.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is fighting a controversial battle for his re-election next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that, even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to give Chilean territories and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be issued only six months after the final arguments are presented suggests that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of further advancing Bolivia’s goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
“The current Bolivian government has usurped the issue of access to the sea,” Zarate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining goodwill in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Belge, Bolivia's spokesman in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extraordinarily swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to inaugurate a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139-year disputes with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular leaders, uses the issue of getting out to sea as a political decan.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it can’t be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made at a summit in Singapore by the two heads of state.
Ree made those comments while U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears ready to resume nuclear diplomacy that had reached a stalemate three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un.
He says the view that the ongoing sanctions and the U.S.’s refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will eventually force the North to “kneel” is a summer night’s dream.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration if Pyongyang does not first make major disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit in the U.S.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is seriously considering repealing an arsenal that the country considers likely to be the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available at a store near you
If you want to grow the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of odd oversized hats for their Spring-Summer 2019 collection that stole the show at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations on the runway.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was an excessive beige hat decorated with a wide bor with wings that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories were watermelon decorated with gems, a magic hat, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, on time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and were more distracting to Hannibal Lecter than to high sewing fashion.
One creation brought to mind complete diving equipment with a respirator and glasses, while another looked like melted ice cream on a shovel.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with huge accessories, you are lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach central shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after "La Boba", the sheepskin hat with the too wide can we have seen wearing so many, from Rihanna to Emily Rataikovsky.
The popular brand that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media sent yet another great creation to the walkway, a beach bag almost as big as the model that carries it wearing his swimsuit.
The dark orange shelf bag, decorated with shelf crosses and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out from Jacquemus’ Spring-Summer 2019 La Riviera collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told the FEMAIL column: "I expect to see big hats and big beach bags in the shopping malls next summer, as the designer made such a great feeling that it would be hard to ignore it."
John Edwards: Language Skills are Necessary for the Citizens of the World
Scotland’s independent schools have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with yet another series of outstanding results in the exams, which were only further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community-based activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to students and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher educational levels, the professional career they will choose and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational field that can design and implement a school-to-school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective course in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to someone in a language that they understand, then what you say goes into their heads.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say goes into his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s exams, we find that languages are at the top of the scoreboards, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved an A-grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A grade in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied French.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today, as a course of choice, are considered as important as courses related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Committee revealed that, in terms of the reasons why employers were having difficulty filling vacancies, a 17 percent share of the class was related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills is becoming increasingly imperative, so that young people are prepared for their future professional careers.
As more future employment opportunities require language proficiency, these skills are essential in a globalized world. -
Regardless of the career you will choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, because of this skill that you will be able to use throughout your life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to make a conversation, while French was the only language that spoke two-digit (15 percent of respondents).
For this reason, investing in language teaching today is important for today's children.
The knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of the developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK with a 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose from in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
One cannot deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as truly "international communication skills" (international communication skills).
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for Scotland’s youth.
They have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The expectation of fans eager to see Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday in the first game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet decided how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six-game schedule that the Lakers have to give before the race season.
"I don't need any preparation races at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's Concentration in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of rallyes starting in West Virginia’s Willing.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies next week, including tours of friendly neighboring areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his choice for the Supreme Court to be pending, Trump seeks to bolster popular support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress with the Novi Sad vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump concentration in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be referred to this week’s FBI hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, which were held in a tense atmosphere due to allegations of sexual offences, with a vote of confirmation by the Elder.
However, the primary goal of this series of rallyes is to help Republicans who face a dubious outcome in the November election to gain some momentum.
Thus, the Trump campaign staff said that these five gatherings next week are aimed at “mobilizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the pro-Reuters and pro-Semitic majority that they have in the Senate.”
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as we go into the busy period of the campaign,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters, who wanted to remain patient.
The gathering scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wiling could bring supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by a difference of over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is low on polling.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come and try to give him a push to the ballot box," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team has the courage to fight by keeping hopes alive as it travels to Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided games, the Saturday afternoon fours might have been all this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of impulse is a completely invented athletic idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such encounters.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"It was six degrees ahead and now it's four degrees ahead, so I guess we have a little momentum," Jordan Spith said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of being ahead by four points and remaining twelve in the game.
Americans, Spit says, feel the "air on their sails" and have a lot to encourage them, like twins Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spit was deadly from tee to green and sets an example.
The voices of the celebrations became louder as he continued his round, achieving a critical hit to get the four-all-square game when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The hit with which they won the game in 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations that show his belief that the American team is not out.
“You have to look deep inside you and worry about your own game,” Spit said.
That’s what every player has left.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but adorable twin has reached four out of four and seems to be doing nothing wrong.
The "Hollywood" was the only twin that didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way in which the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy spectators, seals the fact that it is the players who will have to win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flitwood or Molinari to seal a possible European win.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory remains premature.
Baba Watson and Webb Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Norren.
With a bogey and two doubles in front nine they pushed the Spaniard and the Swede so deep into a hole they couldn’t get out of it.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourball and foursomes are such exciting matches to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can change at once.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead in the last day, but this foursome match also showed that the U.S. team has the guts, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after its advance in the fourball and the foursome of Saturday with 10-6 against the US.
Inspired by Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari, they formed with two wins against a rival Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National so far in four points.
The European side of Thomas Biorn, trying to retain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the inappropriate American side in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. resisted more in the foursome, winning two games, but were unable to cover the difference.
Jim Furrick’s side needs eight points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday to maintain the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European newcomer to win four series points, while along with Molinari, also known as "Mollywood", after a shocking weekend, he is just the second duo in the Premier League to win four times.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball, they joined forces to defeat a tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson DeSabo with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who was dragged into the two races on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 races in fourball and foursome and seven sets.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourball, returned to Henryk Stenson's team-mate for the foursome with 2&1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, taking first and third place in the world rankings.
Not everything went well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 win over Spain’s John Ram and Ian Pauler in the fourball and later returned to defeat Paulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome while losing both holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team was able to recover while losing four points in the singles, although because he is the trophy, Furik is enough to score a tie to maintain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not be unilaterally disarmed without confidence measures
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepened a sense of mistrust toward the United States and that his country was not going to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" in the past year, such as the halting of nuclear and ballistic missile tests, the decommissioning of nuclear testing facilities and the decommissioning of nuclear testing facilities.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to unilaterally begin our disarmament."
While Ree reiterated known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "stage-by-step" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded as it progressed in the process, his statement was not significant.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim Jong-un pledged to work for the U.S. Security Council.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first "deliver" its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing the harsh international sanctions that have been imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'first denuclearization' and increases pressure by threatening with sanctions to achieve its purpose by blackmailing, putting obstacles even in the 'end of war declaration'," he said.
“The perception that sanctions can kneel us is a dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not make any reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader pointed out at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the partner in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the U.S., denuclearization would not be a problem.
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. inland with North Korea’s ballistic missiles was inevitable because the “bad president” was “bad.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to move forward with disarmament measures, but said that much more needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in place.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying, “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it’s okay.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and uninterruptedly until complete, final and confirmed denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to neutralize the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, to be denounced by North Korea a few hours later as having "the demands of a gangster."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear facility, if the United States takes “correct measures.”
He clarified that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was pursuing were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and promoted the smoothing of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Lessons on How to Get Enough Rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University aims for all undergraduate students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing crowd of overnight study cultures by consuming high levels of caffeine.
One academic found that students at the number one university in the world often don’t know basic things, such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a qualified doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the lesson after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I learning about this just now, in my last year?"
She said no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Bareira, a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to include the course when it was found that the students were in attendance.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is the image of a student dormitory, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how the athletic performance is affected, and how it is affected.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their day-to-day routines.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke,” added Professor Chiesler.
The culture of being proud because you studied all night long still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is a swelling problem.
Enough sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and stress, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, melancholy.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chissler plan the course, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said his lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a lesson all over the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program before they start their studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chistler recommended that students set up a warning for the time they should go to bed, as well as an alarm clock for the time they woke up, and be aware of the harmful consequences of the "blue light" emitted into the light that can be emitted by electronic monitors, LEDs and lights.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga scores against Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered yet another tragic loss away from home as Dolly Menga's shot led Steven Gerard's discordant side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team sought to score their first off-season win since the February triumph with 4-1 at St. Johnstown, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard's only second loss in 18 games as head coach, leaving the team behind.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' inspiring roster seemed unable to retaliate.
While Rangers is now down in sixth place, Livingston is up in third, with just a goal difference from Hibernian ahead.
Rangers may be in trouble as well, as Superintendent Callum Spence needed first aid for a head injury caused by an object that was thrown off the deck.
Gerard made eight changes to the team's composition and beat Air in the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same "Live 11" composition that took a grade from Harts last week and would be happy with how this beautiful machine of his could suffocate any effort of the opponents.
Rangers may have dominated the occupation, but Livingstone did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga’s first long pass sent Scott Pitman into the Alan McGregor area, but the average didn’t find the ball.
A deep free shot by Kigan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow all he could do was send the ball away from the bar.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith for the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have won a penalty at 15' as he clashed with Steven Lowelles, but referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombian's complaints.
Rangers had only two shots inside the area in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not worry at all about Lashana Kulimbali's head and Ovi Ejaria's subtle shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the game Livbie was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that she deserved the win for the effort alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and found Menga who just completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the half by taking out Kulibali and putting on Ryan Kent. The change yielded almost immediately as the extreme passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure guests into the style of the game she knows and enjoys, with Lithgow and Hulkett taking away one distant ball after another.
Holt's side could have increased the gap towards the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs straight, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt from the corner.
Rangers deputy Glenn Middleton had another penalty phase to the end as he clashed with Jacobs, but again Thompson ignored it.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Meter
A page from the almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: as today, 136 years ago and VALE... the day that future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to the device now known as the Geiger meter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger meter has moved into the sphere of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to detect radioactive metallic elements like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of people caused by radioactivity on the metallic elements.”
Evans: "Look, he's doing crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name continues its work.
New anti-cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" the problematic cells
New Cancer Vaccine Teachs Immune to ‘See’ Problem Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize problematic cells in the context of treatment
The method involves extracting immunocells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can “see” a protein that is common in various cancers and then re-inject them.
A vaccine under test shows hopeful results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize problematic cells saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the lab so that they "see" a protein common to many cancers, which is called HER2, and then re-infusing the cells.
Professor Jay Berzowski, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands.”
As Professor Berzowski explained, the HER2 protein “forms the driving force for the development of several types of cancers,” such as breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers.
A similar approach in which immune cells are extracted from patients and then “teached” how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended Trump, wearing a hat with the motto MAGA, after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was dismissed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an outrageous interview in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, titled Ghost Town, during which he wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again, he gave a recital of deception against the Democrats and recaptured it.
“Sometimes I talk to a white man and he says, ‘But how do you like Trump?
“If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL opened with a sketch starring Matt Damon, with the Hollywood star roaming Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on complaints of Christine Blazey Ford for sexual abuse.
Although not broadcast, the video of West’s delusion was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to distract West with this post.
West also complained to the public that he was not treated well in the background because of his hat.
"They bowled me in the back.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
I've been bullied!
And they say I don't know what's going on with me," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm going to wear the superman's cape, because that way no one will be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
“Try love.”
His comments were disapproved at least twice by the public and SNL’s co-stars appeared to be in a difficult position, Variety reported, with one person stating in the magazine: “The whole studio was dominated by deadly silence.”
West was called as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused several people when he sang I Love It dressed up as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by Kandas Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING TO THE GROUP.”
However, the show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "himself and that's wonderful."
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes or by supporting their ‘art’) who I believe embraces and exudes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the creature that was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Paf Didi, Pafi and P. Didi.
Rapper Snoop Dogg had changed his name to Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of music Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of swordsman John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor denounces the stereotype of the crowd of heroes, saying that such screen roles convey to young boys the message that they must be tough to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said that "something is going wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be combated in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he has a "strong point of view" on the issue.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much. Where did we make the mistake with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the masculine characters it promotes.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to show such behavior in order to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time. How can we change it?
Clearly, something has gone wrong with our young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he does not intend to play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "ending the battles and the horses."
From November, Kit will star in the revival of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that his acquaintance with Rose's wife is the best he's earned from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in line, so in a way she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose portrayed Ugritt, the love repulsion of John Snow, the character portrayed by Kit, in the Emmy-winning series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of cases, the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus was spreading rapidly to parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had nearly fallen to zero, according to China’s health officials at a conference in Yunan province.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines, as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that she leaked data from Republican senators, condemning “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic MP argued that the allegations were promoted by commentators and “far-right” websites.
“Lies, lies and even more terrible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill environment during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual offences against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanos.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Cavano.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and published the data of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and a blatant lie,” Waters continued.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been breached due to these fraudulent and false claims, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely untrue and flagrant lie.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary, Ari Flaeser.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleiser wrote.
"This shows that he has no courage to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He shouldn't be bold.
He must not question the motives of the one who accuses him.
He has to be calm and peaceful.”
Fleiss appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of appearing very angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican nominee seeking to dethrone Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations."
“We will do everything to find those responsible,” he continued, “and to hold them accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Relapses - a subtle spy movie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new film with a British character and this seems to be true in this revival of the franchise of action-comedy films with hero Johnny Ingles, which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and returned in 2011 with the film Johnny English.
Can this humorous self-sacrifice about how obviously bad we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Inglis with his eyes peeled, was able to renew his license to make them mantara for a second time. His name states that it is a broader comedy creation designed for non-English-speaking film spectators.
This is, of course, the ghastly secret agent of 2012, who while pretending to have the luster and manners of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouseau, with a dose of "Mr. Bin" and something from the guy who played a single note on the musical theme of the film The Roads.
It is also based on the traveler and international man of mystery once portrayed by Atkinson in Barclaycard’s most forgotten TV commercials, sowing chaos in his passage.
There are one or two great moments in this last JE movie.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the helmets hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent for comedy, however, humor is rather subtle and oddly rare, especially as “serious” film franchises such as 007 and Dangerous Mission now include quite a few comedic elements.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and in my opinion, Johnny Ingles’s crazy backwards are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson’s bovine-movie sketches for the person of Bean.
The eternal central issue is that the UK has a serious problem.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret online spy network, revealing the identity of all of Britain’s agents on a mission, to the great dismay of an agent on duty, who is portrayed by Kevin.
It’s the last drop for a bold and ambitious prime minister on the brink of collapse because of political antipopulation: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this character reminiscent of Theresa May, but the script doesn’t help her much.
Intelligence advisers inform her that, since every active spy has been revealed, she will have to re-establish someone disarmed.
And that means Johnny Ingles, who now works as a director at some aristocratic school, but informally gives lessons for secret agents: here are some nice scenes, as Ingles offers a spy academy.
Inglis returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with Buff's former and passionate partner, again portrayed by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role that Vicky Pepperdine is not fully exploited.
So, Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service go back to action, meeting the beautiful and fateful Ophelia Bulletova portrayed by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously fascinated by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s technological problems: the menacing Jason Volta, who is portrayed by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Baf begin the odyssey of their pharzocomedy: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a messy French restaurant, they cause chaos as they try to illegally board the luxury yacht of Voltaire, and the
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as adorable and messy as it is, it continues to resemble a little children's TV.
Moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I wonder: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he will truly magnify himself with his talent?
The Workers deny that they are considering a plan to work the British for four days, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan that the British work four days a week, but be paid for five-day work.
The party, according to information, is pursuing corporate bosses to channel the savings achieved through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend without a reduction in their salary.
Sources say the idea is in line with the party’s economic agenda and plans to turn the scales in favor of workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Labor Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “Policy change is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day work week is an ambition aligned with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as the party’s overall strategy for industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not party politics and is not considered by the party.”
The shadow government’s secretary, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour Conference to develop his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "unpersuasive directors" and "profiteers" in public utility companies.
The shadow government secretary’s plans also mean that today’s shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back, as a potential Labour government could make “retentions” due to suspicious setbacks.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors of companies and to create mutual funds, so that 10% of private sector companies will be given to employees who will receive annual dividends of up to 500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk on the 60 Minutes show about whether the FBI’s investigation into Cavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence some Republicans.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could figure out anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy showed up more openly than his colleague from South Carolina. I'm sorry.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly, “Did you do it?”
He was unmoved, determined, categorical."
However, Graham’s vote does not seem to change.
"I've decided on Brett Cavanaugh and it's going to take some kind of explosive charge to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
"And whoever he has named, he can't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also an equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are expected to flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to secure a free ticket at the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), the interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as declaring volunteers, sending an email to a global leader, or calling them.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while there are 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert the right way to persuade our fellow citizens to take action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” when some feel they are really making a difference by signing an e-mail request or sending two e-mails?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen group has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, promoting a number of different goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies amounting to more than $37 billion, which are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The team estimates that hedged funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and implementers, who have pledged to “help children make full use of their potential”, promising to give Rwanda over $35 million in subsidies, $4 million in subsidies and $5 million in subsidies.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracy Ulman, co-founder of The Power of Nutrition, in a statement.
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project titled The Power of Nutrition, which targets 5 million women and children with nutrition problems.
Answering the question "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" included in the website's frequently asked questions,
A member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the big human rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because united we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mono are some of the artists who will appear at this year’s New York City event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy to ‘Exclude’ Blocking Russia’s Energy Exports – Interior Minister
Washington may turn to its Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from being made available to markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where it is trying at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reasons why they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
“The United States has the ability, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that Russian energy is not made available to the market,” he said.
Zinc was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group labeled as the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a pony that knows only one trick" as it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration has taken on the mission to boost exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that, according to Trump, will make Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project with a budget of $11 billion, which is going to double the existing capacity of the pipelines to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s strong resistance to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak told AFP after a meeting with the Russian energy minister.
The U.S. stance provoked Germany’s reaction, which underscored its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kebf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting he had with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for the presidency in 2020, according to the senator of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for the presidency after the midterm elections, according to the Associated Press.
In a meeting at the Hallowe'en City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering it.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our troubled government, and that’s why we need a woman at the top,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will consider a nomination for the presidency."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” he said.
Warren did not chew her words on Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavano.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that “of course, an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote.”
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren voters do not believe she should be nominated for the presidency in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts’ “potential” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favor of such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for a potential candidacy than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other popular names from Democrats discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would have formally decided by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Refers to Track Palin's Posttraumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's Concentration
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"With what my son has been going through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and the injuries our soldiers carry when they return home," she told the audience at a gathering for Delaware.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said about her son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back harder, they come back wondering if there is respect for each and every member of his team and what they have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wassila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interference in a report of domestic violence and gun possession while in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Gu Gu police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the questioning of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the region filed a amicus curiae report in Washington on Friday supporting an asylum seeker to challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" were abusing her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the U.S., as countries facing severe problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board (BIA) and allowed undeclared migrants fleeing domestic violence situations to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Rasin, said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
"According to federal law, all asylum applications must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such an obstacle violates this principle", according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “make an indispensable workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims trying to flee situations of domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation on the basis of race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political view," Sessions said in his June 11 statement on the policy.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious ones) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, trying to relieve her fever-positive baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulances bring in more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Some residents tried to return to their ruined homes and collect their belongings through the waters, trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which suffered damage from the 7.5-magnitude Richter earthquake, were unable to meet the needs.
Some wounded, such as Dewey Harris, who suffered a fracture of the waist and shoulder, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where first aid was given in the countryside due to continued strong earthquakes.
Tears flooded his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake ravaging the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I was trapped in the debris of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence prevailed.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper overriding the mutual trade benefits between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China criticized him for accusing Beijing of using it.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited the pay-per-view insert of the China Daily that appeared on the Des Moines Register, the most-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in Congressional elections.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase of the escalating campaign launched by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is not forbidden for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a escalating trade war and have imposed various tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s tariff retaliation at the start of the trade war was aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor in Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Branstand wrote in an opinion article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, “is instigated into this kind of bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In an effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is harnessing America’s precious tradition of free speech and free press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
“On the contrary, in Beijing’s booths, you will find few divergent voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China’s troubled economic course, given that the Communist Party’s media are under its control.”
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, though he did not reveal which one.
Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections due to fiasco with Cavanaugh, analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments on this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have stated that they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can’t be restored,” Grant Reer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Reer doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute move to ask the FBI for an investigation will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and they are certainly not going to forget it in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman, said in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters rhymed the slogan "November is coming!" in the Senate corridor as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee gave the green light to Cavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Mieres.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels," Stu Rodenberg, an indomitable political analyst, told the news website.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of indecisive women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while dislike the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford’s public statement in which she detailed her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had predicted that there could be a reaction if the Republicans proceeded with the oath.
“It’s a huge chaos for the Republican Party,” Michael Stile, former chairman of the National Republican Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh will be put out. It's also about how Republicans handled the issue and how they treated her," said Guy Cecil, who was a member of the U.S. news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after Fortn and Cavanaugh’s depositions, falling slightly more in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents certainly or most likely believed Ford’s statement, while 35% said they certainly or most likely believed Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Cavanaugh likely or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s move, the FBI took over to investigate Ford’s and at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavano attacked her while she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals while they were at a party, when they were both studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new twist of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on Berners Lee’s open Solids platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who will be able to access it and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “global sovereignty.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage space" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, pending task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify being all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal electronic data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this capability “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is the company to offer resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers who worked on the project, and a community of volunteer code developers.
As of this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, overturning business models overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a Medium post released on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners Lee has been a strong voice in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet,” Berners Lee added.
Bernard Van: A tribute to a clergyman who received the Cross of Victory in World War I
The only Anglican clergyman to have received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a soldier was honored in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van received the medal on 29 September 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had defeated the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday, a commemorative plaque was unveiled by his two grandchildren, which was accompanied by a parade in Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the plaque's revelations were made exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion to the St. Kendall Canal in the midst of very dense fog and while receiving heavy fire from combat weapons and machine guns.
Later, he hurried to the front line and with "excellent courage" led the line forward, before hitting himself with a three-gun combat weapon from the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never reach, it's something that makes you feel unlimited respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also deposited a wreath after the parade, which was led by the young Brentwood Philharmonic Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he "felt great honor to have attended the parade" and added that "the bravery of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he has from many people."
MMA fans spent the night watching the Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa the Pig
Think of the following scenario: you have spent the night watching the exciting Bellator 206, but you are deprived of the joy of seeing this unique sporting event.
The program in San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and would be broadcast live in the UK, from Channel 5, to the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mussassi and Rory McDonald were getting ready to go to the ring, spectators in the UK were stunned when the show switched to Peppa the Pig.
Some were not happy at all, as they had stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for the race.
A fan on Twitter described the show as “some kind of sick joker.”
“According to the law, this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so the children’s program had to be shown,” said Dave Swarts, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, of course."
Bellator’s president, Scott Cocker, said they were going to elaborate on the program to include UK viewers in the future.
"If we think about ripples, I think we can do it," Cocker said.
"But it's six in the morning on Sunday there and we won't be able to do it until our own time Sunday, that is their own Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change was made, a lot of messages were exchanged back and forth and they were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the rules.
I promise you, next time, that's not going to happen.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to offer more to the fans and we overreacted.
It is an unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feeling “Under” Due to His Sexuality
The diving Olympian, Tom Daley, said he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, however, this drove him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs that Lauren Laverne presented on Radio 4, she said she supported gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that since he became a parent, he is less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Yang, a regular presenter of the well-known radio show, has been on leave for several months due to illness.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "inadequate" compared to others as he grew up, because "it was socially unacceptable for someone to like both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and the will to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The twice-bronze Olympian is a prominent defender of the rights of the LGBTI community and took advantage of his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to move forward in decriminalizing homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without impact, and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar-winning actor Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years older than him, but claimed that the age difference was never an issue.
"When you spend so much at such a young age" (he first participated in the Olympics at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a peer who has similar good and bad moments."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said he had changed "his whole perspective."
“If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal,” he said.
“But there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My own Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics as he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘Dad, you’re not going to be near us to sit in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and he was dead did I finally accept that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life, to compete in diving at the Olympics in my home country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which stirred him up in preparation for the Olympics and still stirred him up.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Michaelson will sit on the bench on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his performance to avoid being remembered for the wrong reasons.
Michaelson, who takes part for the 12th time (record number) in matches held every two years, was forced by leader Jim Furrick to sit on the bench for Saturday’s fourball and foursomes.
Rather than being at the center of the action, as is customary for the United States, the five-time winner divided the day to animate the lines and "work" his game in the hope that he will fix his problem points.
Without ever having been the most straightforward driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old’s game is not suitable for the narrow course of Le Golf National, where the distant ones are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the pitch wasn’t enough, Michaelson, in Sunday’s ninth race, confronts Francesco Molinari, the champion of the British Open, who works with the newcomer Tommy Flitwood to win the four of them.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Michaelson’s game can be critical.
Furik expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully understood the role he’s playing today, he friendly hit me in the back, put his hand around me and said he’d be ready for tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he has offered a lot to these groups, both last week and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up, so we thought we had to go.
He wants to go out there, like everyone else.”
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for most Sunday matches in the Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that did not reach the height of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half, although Furik said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spirited, he likes to joke and he's great in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun teasing him this week. It was funny to see it.
It’s not just in the game.”
The head of the European team, Thomas Biorn, knows that the big lead could soon be lost.
Thomas Biorn, the head of the European team, knows from his experience that a big lead starting from the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a defeat.
The Dane made his debut at the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Balesteros managed to take a five-point advantage over the Americans, but just managed to pass the final line with 13<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 breasts difference, winning
"You constantly remind yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama, we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but barely barely," Biorn said, in the picture, after watching the 2018 generation and 10 Le win 5-3 on Friday.
So history will show me and all the team members that this is not over.
We're going ready tomorrow to give it all.
We'll go out there and play right.
Nothing's finished until you see the grades on the board.
We have a goal, to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know very well that in the other team there are equally good players – the best in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Biorn adds: “I wouldn’t rush to prejudge the result.
Tomorrow is another Beast.
Tomorrow's individual performance counts, and that's something different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there on your own, you’re testing your golf skills to the fullest.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, how to make the best of themselves tomorrow.
You leave your team-mate behind and he has to give everything and show his best.”
Unlike Biorn, Jim Furrick from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than those they had with their teammates, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furick himself has experienced both extremes of the last day’s upheavals, as he belonged to the winning team at Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every word of his class," he replied when asked how Ben Crenso, the leader in 1999, had gathered his players for the last day.
“We have 12 major games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brookline, like in Medinah.
When we get that momentum, there’s a lot of pressure in the middle of the race.
We decide our series accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has taken over the lead of the race and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it covers the whole route," Biorn said, justifying his choices for singles.
New postponement for Germany's new warship
The new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War era, but it is not going to be picked up until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs.
The position of the Rheinland-Pfalz frigate, the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which cites a spokesman for the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems with the delivery were decisive for the fate of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They will carry a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years outside the German ports.
However, the constant delays mean that although warships are considered to be the latest technology, which will allow Germany to show its strength abroad, until they are finally put into service, they will already be outdated, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate frigate F125 became headliner last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned ship to shipyard after delivery.
Not much information has been known about the reasons for the return, but the German media reported a number of significant "defects with the software and hardware" that would render the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software problems were particularly significant; as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, only half compared to the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has a much larger weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz frigate is believed to have twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the cost of the entire project (including the training of the crew) was also a matter of concern.
It is said to have reached the small amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion), while the initial budget was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems plaguing the new frigates are particularly important as Germany’s naval force shrinks.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy "will soon have no ships for missions."
The official said the problem had swollen over time because the old ships were disarmed, but there were no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is hiding the secret life of bats
A new research conducted at a farm in the Highlands of Scotland seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting for their food.
The findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to the design of future actions to protect the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanobite and the small bat, as well as the brown bat and dompton’s myotis in Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld scanners.
An analysis of the sound of all recordings by specialists will verify the frequency of calls of bats, as well as what species have this behavior.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be created to form a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, natural environment protection consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by construction work and development projects that affect the places where they gnaw and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also hazardous, as are adhesive tapes for flies and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
The bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They use an advanced sound sensing technique to detect insects and obstacles in the course of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, considers bats very important.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspect the places where bats roam, and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also created Scotland’s first and only exclusively for bats shelter at Threave Estate, Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat species live.
The farm manager, David Thompson, states that the farm is the ideal land for bats.
"Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of big trees and an ideal habitat.
There’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to grow their populations.”
It stresses that it is important to first check for the presence of bats before any maintenance work in homes, as the destruction of a single nest with small ones could kill up to 400 females and small ones, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Fleas are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them or disturb their tranquility, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer her help.
He said: "There's still a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know the evolution of their populations."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as his lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as "fake news", saying that some "want to self-promote themselves" by exploiting his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The attacker of National Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, named Katherine Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, she allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
"They want to self-promote and exploit my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and all is well,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations he published, which they described as “an unacceptable report of rumors affecting privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Skerrs said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages proportionate to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting them at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her by nature, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy", but betrayed him the other "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo admits that they had sexual intercourse, but that she was consenting.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried about her "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she is trying to overturn the settlement as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of getting a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse and this summer he jumped to Italian Juventus to secure a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will regret' loss of car industry 'forever'
The United Kingdom will "regret forever" if it loses its reputation as a global leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese auto industry said the impact of cross-border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be cut off,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s CEO in Bernaston.
Other automakers in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said it will shut down its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The key concerns concern risks in the supply chain according to the automotive industry in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line follows just-in-time. Spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured on-demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be problems at the border, resulting in delays and a lack of parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold stock for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU "is specifically trying to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
“We need a deal. We want the best possible deal that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The elements that come not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers are that the continuity of supply chains must necessarily be ensured.”
Toyota was not able to say for how long it would stop production, however, warned that in the long run the additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Chuvallaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the union manager of Unite in the factory, said that union members are increasingly concerned: “From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "suffer another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavano continues, the White House said on Wednesday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, the links of Trump's aides to Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility of Trump dismissing the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a bow tie in order to record his conversations with Trump and make it possible to remove the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in which both Cavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual harassment.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week into the allegations against Cavanaugh, further delaying a vote by the Senate plenary.
Sarah Sanders, a spokeswoman for Trump, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "A date has not yet been set, perhaps this week, but perhaps another week of data from all the other cases dealing with the Supreme Court has been postponed.
But we'll see, after all, I like to always update the guy."
Some journalists have refuted this claim: Sanders has been holding a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders responded that the limited frequency of updates was not due to aversion to the "impressive" moves of television journalists, although she said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being shown."
He then suggested that there would be increased or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president gives more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
Updates will continue to be conducted, Sanders said, but "if the guy has the ability to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's incomparably better than talking to me.
We are trying to apply it often and you have seen that we have applied it often in the last few weeks and it will take the place of the press release where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with official visitors.
Individual press interviews are uncommon.
This week in New York, the president probably proved why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes odd appearance in front of concentrated journalists.
The Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland’s National Health System amid fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to EU citizens employed in Scotland’s National Health System to express the country’s gratitude and to wish them to remain after the UK’s departure from the European Union.
A Scottish MEP, Jean Freeman, has sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of applying for settled status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued and are heading towards expected decisions in the autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christie Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christie Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game, where the Tennessee State Tigers were defeated by a 31-27 score by Vanderbilt Commodore.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half.
"He came to the bench and just collapsed there," Reid said.
Exercisers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the bench and then put him on a stretcher and carried him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV television station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was "no evidence yet on the type/extension of the injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year undergraduate undergraduate student under the "redshirt" scheme, spends his first season in Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made a total of five tacks on Saturday before leaving the game, thus reaching the 18 total tacks for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the UK, while the additional amounts will be used to help the homeless, according to the Torys’ new plans.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will begin to be charged a higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the UK, while the additional amounts will be used to help the homeless, as Theresa May will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises of more affordable housing and to target high-income workers.
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the UK, while the additional monetary amounts will strengthen the government’s campaign to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, imposed on the current stamp duty, together with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes and homes for rent, may amount to three percent.
The Treasury expects the measure to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, leading to higher prices and making it more difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp fee so that more young people can get their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of keeping property prices high, acquiring land without, however, using it, and called on May to remove the ceilings on economic homes in order to restore Britain's "housing disgrace."
Mr. Corbin announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, including rent checks and a ban on “no-fault” eviction.
He also wants to give more powers to the councils in order to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – to improving life for every new generation.
And this implies the repair of the dissolved real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and make a life here.
However, it would not be right for non-UK residents and overseas-based companies to buy homes as easily as hard-working British nationals.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has now become too distant, and the indecency of homelessness remains.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach the Scottish team"
Sanderland's head coach, Jack Ross, says his "absolute ambition" is to eventually become the coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish is thrilled with the challenge of resuscitating the North East England team, which is currently in third place in the Third Class of English Football (League One), three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, having previously returned St. Mirren to the Scottish Championship the previous racing season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team and that's it," Ross told the Scottish BBC on Sportsound.
“But I grew up seeing the Scottish team in Hubden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that’s something that always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed in coaching teams.”
Among Ross's predecessors in Sanderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gas Poyet and Paolo DiCanio.
Aloa Athletic's former coach says he was not shocked when he was asked to inherit such established names in such a large team, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, success for me will be measured by the answer to the question, 'Can I bring this team back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this team, it belongs undoubtedly to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get her there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross began his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period as an assistant coach at Dubarton and a period of 15 months with Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa get back from the relegation to the third category and led St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to conquer the Championship next season.
Ross also says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Myren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was rather a real crossroads," he said, recalling taking the position of Aloa's coach.
“I really thought it was better for me to be a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making decent money out of it and I had gotten quite high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I still struggle with the stress and pressure of the job, but the work of the coach fits me perfectly.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than I’ve felt with myself all my adult life.”

The summer heat boosted profits for Britain’s tried-and-tested pubs but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits declined by 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy firm CGA8, which compiled the data, said: "The continued sunshine and the greater than expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern to the previous month.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that serve alcohol went far better, with the corresponding figures of previous years having risen more than the corresponding figures of the restaurants fell.
Pubs serving food also suffered on sunny days, though not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM’s Recreation and Hospitality Analysts, said: “These results confirm the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a drop in sales of 4.8 percent on an annual basis will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for the businessmen in the field of catering, and time will show whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a much-desired extension.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including start-ups, rose to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.

One in five children keep secret accounts on social media, hidden from their parents <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
According to the study, one in five children - even just 11 years old - keep secret accounts on social media, hidden from their parents and teachers.
Study of 20,000 High School Students Reveals Increase in Fake Insta Pages on Instagram
This news has fueled fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “master” account to point out to their parents
One in five children - even just 11 years old - create social media accounts, which they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid rise in fake Insta accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
This news has fueled fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they maintain a healthy “master” account to point out to their parents, while at the same time maintaining private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter spotted a teenage girl who urged others to rape her (“rape me”).
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC in independent schools found that 40 percent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to keeping secrets.
HMC Chairman Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teens succumb to the temptation to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't locate them."
Eilin Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish board of directors
Eilid Doyle was elected as a non-executive advisor to Scotland's board of directors at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track athlete, and President Ian Bitey has commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her broad international experience over the past decade.
“Eilind enjoys immense respect from the entire Scottish, British and global track community, and we are confident that the track in Scotland will have a huge benefit from joining the board,” Bitty said in a statement.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can actually contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the gold medal in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, having won a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, remained paralyzed after a temporary chessboard.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if and how much I will recover.
It was exhausting, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again and today I am doing agility exercises!
“Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Breastfeeding advertising that compares mothers with cows divides the online public opinion
A breastfeeding company has split online public opinion with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows feeding them.
In order to launch the so-called “world’s first silent and wearable breastfeeder,” consumer tech company Elvie has released a humorous ad inspired by video clips to highlight the new freedom it offers to breastfeeders.
Four real mothers dance inside a cow barn full of hay, with a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm wetting myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't stallions, they're my boobs."
The choir goes on: "Pull it, pump it, feed babies, pump it, pump it, milk my ladies."
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers as many say it does not take seriously the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal it a few days after giving birth,” someone commented.

Someone else commented: "Obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breastfeeding for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An advertisement completely out of reality."
Others defended the ad, while a woman admitted that her song seemed "disgusting."
“I think it’s a very smart idea.
I'd buy such a breastfeeder if I was still breastfeeding.
The pump made me feel just like a cow.
Advertisement is a little crazy, but I didn't sit down to over-analyze it.
It’s a smart product,” someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a funny ad that targets moms who pump breast milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women’s team reveals that they were all dancing with the discreet mammals tucked into their bras.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump breast milk with breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
The Elvie breastfeeder, however, is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and discreetly fits inside a breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even get out during the pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Director of Creative at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s breastfeeding is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between breastfeeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast milk pumping and all the challenges it entails, while simultaneously showing in a fun and correlative way the incredible new sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's breastfeeding has become a front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for fashion designer Marta Yakubovsky while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved Silently to Texas Border Camp
The number of detained migrant children has risen, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to match children.
Traditionally, most conservatives are immigrants themselves without travel documents and are afraid to go ahead and ask for a child and thus jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was heightened in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior employee of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had been asked to support unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had a white criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are either supporters or members of the supporters’ household are illegally in the country and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these individuals," Albens said.
In order to expedite the processing of children’s cases, the authorities introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before a court within one month of the commencement of their detention and not within 60 days of their detention.
Many will appear through videoconferencing, in the place of a face-to-face appearance, in order to develop their claims for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not eligible for discharge will be immediately expelled.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to be stressed or distressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where indications that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving the children to the scene without giving them enough time to prepare the children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muhammad also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Muammar Muammar, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with appropriately."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to "give this sacred battle until we expel all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and informing both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Muammar al-Assad said the conditions were good for their return and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading unreasonable fears" that prompted refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They’re politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a de-militarized zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Muammar al-Muhammad, however, said the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military actions would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front.
UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Muammar al-Assad put the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned that no intervention should be made.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again, unless, as many liberal spectators probably hope, the motion of censure and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
It would undoubtedly be “The most dramatic presidency finale of all time!”
So far, there are no signs of spectators getting tired.
Since 2014, viewer numbers in the high-speed zone have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million on MSNBC.
The Fox News network has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the high-speed zone, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has scanned the significant TV shows on the radio.
It’s a fire people are drawn to because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neil Baer, producer of ABC’s drama series “Designated Survivor,” where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comic book writer and author of the book titled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
Her driver said she'd vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked, "Why?"
"He said 'because he makes me laugh'," Mrs. Scovel told me.
You can even have fun with the chaos.
Of course, unlike the TV series, the scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy v. Wade case, if the immigrant families are able to reunite and the health of the world.
Frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you surpass the definition of a well-informed citizen when you’re on the watch for six hours to watch a team of experts discuss the use of “many interviews in the background” by Bob Woodward for his book “Fear” (“Fear”), the bomber jacket.
I'll never see Super Mario the same way again, though.
"What he does and that gives you the sense of reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the TV show "Pawn Stars", about the constantly changing actors and actresses in the show.
You don't have the luxury of losing an episode, or you're left behind.
When I met with Mr. Flash this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He couldn’t break up, not when Brett Cavano was about to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging from a thread.
“I remember doing those crazy shows back in the day, and people were saying, ‘This is going to be the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” he told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right in the end."

Foreign money enters the most marginal face-to-face for midterm elections
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional constituency is receiving cash flow, thanks to the realignment of the congressional constituencies, which has put two active members of the congress in the same position.
This newly redesigned suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who was elected to another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb has another active deputy, Republican Keith Rothphos, as his opponent, who represents the former 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesigned following a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January that the old regions were being manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The election rally in the new 17th electoral district triggered a campaign of financial competition between the largest financial divisions of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after achieving a boundary victory at a special election rally held in March for the 18th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress, which was attended by a lot of people.
This position was held by Republicans for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 points.
Political analysts give the Democrats a slight lead.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for its support in China, but has backed down.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, provoking mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and kept a hotel in Panama until the partners dismissed the Trump Organization’s governing team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. head of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions of the U.S. to no longer recognize Taiwan," he said.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, growth and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial support and targeted restrictions on passports, would be painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal meetings evolved, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, as a result of a similar rally that took place last year, which was seen as a step forward for the United States.
But in mid-September, senior executives made it clear that they wanted to move forward with the conference, effectively ending the thoughts of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in an indication of the great importance of the meeting for the administration, diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three U.S. officials, including two of her diplomats, who agreed not to discuss internal affairs.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.

The next hit could be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, for which very strong evidence has now been made public.
It is rumored that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation to the possibility of collusion between Mr Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable before this body as he prepares to reclaim the presidency in the next election and perhaps finally before a jury.
The "if" is a lot, and I am not implying that the fall of Mr Trump, nor of his bonds in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup d'état against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unrestrained course of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a number of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was written in that newspaper that last year he proposed that the president be secretly recorded and that he considered him unsuitable for the position of president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the version adopted by the Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite reasonable charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter into a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I've learned in the Thing, I don't think we're gonna fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light Jewish Saturday candles at that swastika table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorans of the Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapidus Vienna
The Rangers welcomes Rapidus Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain with the Vijayarreal earlier this month, will give her many chances to qualify from the 7th Group of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until the 2–2 draw with Vijayreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Vijayreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We got into the game thinking we could do something and we came out with a degree.
Perhaps we could escape in the end, but, in general, the tie was a fairly fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Thursday is yet another great European night.
Well having things, we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they brought a good result in their last game, but with the world on the deck, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough because of my injuries and the changes that happened to the team itself, but there’s a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Let’s hope that we can do our best now, leave behind last season and succeed.”
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Nearly half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they’ve talked about it to their children.
“People want their family to take care of them, but they don’t take the initiative to have the discussion,” said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Start with this.
Talk to your husband and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide you with care if you don’t express your wishes much earlier.
Work together with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at a redemption price to help you cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own property - as long as you have the money.
Write down your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a health care proxy so that you appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health care professionals will comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Also, consider the possibility of making a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person in order to make decisions on your behalf on financial matters and ensure that your bills are paid, in case you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Report these details to a written plan so you’re ready to go.
“It’s not just the financials, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that you have this plan in place.”

Police described the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m. British Summer Time, as a "accidental event".
The victim did not see the perpetrator of the attack.
The injuries he suffered are not life-threatening and the police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have failed to receive information from Dongala, a region north of Palo, which is closer to the center of the 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the outbreak.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an anti-kingdom stretching along more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline to the southwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The anti-kingdom, a rank of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi and especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is more common in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Response Service.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck western Dongdala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located within the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often hit by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, while above them half.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake on the Richter scale hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake on the Richter scale centered near the city of Pandang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale hit one of the Medawi islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and cost the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A low-depth earthquake hit the Pindi Jaya area in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it brought to the world memories of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's first-born son arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and candidate for vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Palin, from Washila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence complaints and resistance to the rule, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troops.
According to the police report, when a woman who he knew tried to call the police to report the crimes he allegedly committed, he grabbed her phone from her hands.
Palin is temporarily detained at the Mat-Su interim detention shop, with a $500 bail, according to the KTUU television station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "certainly, innocently" when asked, according to the network.
Palin faces charges for three Class A offenses, which means he can be sentenced to up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class A misdemeanor, punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time he's been prosecuted against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to denounce the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of a complaint for the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while in a state of drunkenness.
His partner claimed to have stabbed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating from the moment of the catastrophic event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rarely Imposed Death Penalty for Suspect of New York Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the imposition of a death penalty on Saifoulos Sa<0xC3><0xAF>pov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that cost the life of eight people - a rare penalty of 19 penalties that has to be imposed on the state.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental van from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, drawing 31 pedestrians and cyclists to his side of the road.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Sa<0xC3><0xAF>pov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and caused serious bodily harm "intentionally", according to the statement of intent to impose the death penalty, filed before the Court.
Both of these charges inflict the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Sa<0xC3><0xAF>pov up against the 22-point indictment, which included eight charges of homicide in favor of a criminal organization, a tactic often applied by federal prosecutors and non-prosecutors.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing Sa<0xC3><0xAF>pov's way of carrying out the attack as "atrocious, cruel and filthy."
"Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipoff caused pain, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clives, An-Laur Decadent, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ern
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Court of Southern District of New York prosecuted a case involving the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for the husbands of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of two years of conspiracy to carry out spying in favor of the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sa<0xC3><0xAF>pov, a Uzbek national, appeared unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt satisfied with his action, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack from an ISIS video he saw on his mobile phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to set up the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges listed on the indictment.
David Patton, one of Sa<0xC3><0xAF>pov's federal public prosecutors, said he was "apparently disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting the conviction for life imprisonment with no chance of release will simply prolong the trauma caused by the events for all involved,” Patton said.
Sa<0xC3><0xAF>pov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the imposition of the death penalty.
Toris MP says Nietzschell Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiation
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" on Monday during a rally at the Tory Congress.
The former leader of the UK’s Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May’s MPs said he should be leading the negotiations.
Conservative lawmaker Peter Boone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would have "already come out" by now if Farage had been the Brexit minister responsible.
But the challenge May faces in her effort to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was underscored by the fact that pro-EU Toris partisans took part in a separate protest rally against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chequers compromise plan under control amid attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of staying in the EU and the EU.
Allies insisted on moving forward with her efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Sollichal that he wanted to blow up “the Chequers plan.”
He said that Mr Farage should have been given a title of nobility and that he should have been given the authority to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we would have left now," he said.
MEP from Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit but we have to throw out the Chequers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr Boone dismissed the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The assumption that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.”
Brexit MP Toris Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan does not have the approval of the general public, the Opposition is not going to vote for it, it does not have the approval of our party and our activists who go down the streets and ultimately elect us.
"Please leave the plan, Chuckers, and start listening."
With a sharp message to May, he added: “Prime ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians should be forced to “feel the pressure” if they are preparing to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now there is a question of trust between us – the people – and the order of our politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it if you do this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay in the EU demonstrated in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Few activists were waving Tory's anti-Brexit banners after the group's rally this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they faced with an implementation of the party at the start of the congress.
“It is the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-Canada Type Agreement by enrichment, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
It’s not a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to Seriously Consider Applying for Presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for the presidency after the November election, according to the Associated Press.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during a rally in a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is claiming her re-election in November, with Republican state spokesman Jeff Dil, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is strongly assumed that he can face Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters making use of the city hall's facilities since Trump's tenure began.
An attendee at the meeting asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to form our broken government and that means a woman has to be at the top."
Arrest for the deadly shooting of LSU Sims basketball player
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge’s police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a news conference at 11 p.m. (Eastern Time Zone).
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man who appeared in the video.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot dead near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wade Simms suffered a bullet wound to the head, which led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to the 247sports website.
Wade intervened to defend his friend, and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the spot holding the gun and confessed that he shot Wade Sims.
Simson was arrested without resistance and is detained in the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
Sims, a three-year-old student with a height of 1.98, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, with 10 appearances as the main player last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton goes for a world title as his team’s instructions gave him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
It became clear from the moment Valerie Bottas passed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's commands would play an important role in the race.
Bottas had a good start at the start and almost hung Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and called on Fetel to attack his peer.
Fetel went to the pit first and let Hamilton run the queue of the race, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits one lap later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a wheel-to-wheel battle, which forced Ferrari driver to reluctantly abandon the domestic because of the risk of falling overboard in the double-drive violation.
Max Verstappen started from the last position and was seventh at the end of the first round on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then remained first for a large part of the race as he held his tires aiming to finish quickly and pass ahead of Kimi Rykonen in fourth place.
He eventually went to the pits in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps as Rykonen came fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valerie was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team went great and did the one or two,” Hamilton said.
The language of the body was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Finstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she didn’t leak Christine Blazey Ford’s letter, in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that the allegations in the Senate proved that people are "cowardly and innocent."
“The only thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and malicious and miserable and liars,” he said.
"When you see posts and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked...No, we didn’t leak,” she added mimicking the senator.
Finstein received Ford's letter detailing the allegations against Cavanaugh in July and it leaked earlier in September - but Finstein denied the leak was from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Finstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep her a secret, and I kept her a secret as he asked me to."
But her refusal did not seem to particularly convince the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "Let me tell you something, the body language was very bad.
He may not have, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president hinted that Democrats are using the charges to serve their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the malice, the misery, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to trample to take power and control,” the president said, according to the news website Mediaite.
Elite League: Duddy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dudi.
Duddy Stars took revenge for her defeat in Friday's Elite League match from the Belfast Giants, winning the revenge by 5-3 at Duddy on Saturday.
The Giants took the easy lead with two shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowierier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought the goal for the pitchers before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
François Boussard tied for Dudi and then two goals from Lucas Ludwig Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third loss to the Elite League in the season for the men of Adam Kif, who were coming up with a 2-1 victory over Dudi in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants taking the win in the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFall's assist, while David Rutherford gave the assist thanks to which Bowieier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In an opening period full of action, Sullivan put the field team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquard gave the assist for the draw from Cooney at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead for the Giants in the first half when he scored his second goal for the evening towards the end of the first period.
The team of the pitchers were re-assembled and Boussar equalized again with a power demonstration goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Duddy the lead for the first time in the race towards the end of the second period and he secured the victory with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost in four of their last five games, are playing at home with Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Loses His Life to Save Hundreds of Passengers From Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has declared himself a hero as he lost his life in an attempt to secure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing due to a large earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many have been trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunwan Agung refused to leave his seat at the maneuvering control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it was falling down.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s spokesman, Joannes Shiret, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are shocked by his death," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the dead could be thousands, while the country's disaster management agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to increase further as many bodies are still under the rubble, many of which we have not been able to reach," the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purgoo Nugroho, said in a statement.
Waves that reached six meters destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes bring assistance and supplies.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jean Gelfant, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to save survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night to complete any work related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Now Says Man Is Missing After Airplane Crashes in Lake Micronesia
The airline, which was carrying out a flight that crashed into a lake in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now reports that a man is missing, while earlier it said that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that since Saturday afternoon it is unable to find the traces of a man passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuk.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and the condition of all of them was stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lake outside the landing corridor.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the landing corridor.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane landed very low.
"That's very good," Janes said.
Janes said he and others managed to pass through the water that reached them to the middle of the emergency escape exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working nearby to improve a dock also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the shore before sinking the ship at a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in air carrier clashes registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of these clashes involved Air Niugini.
Analyst lists the timetable of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its prosecution on Saturday in the retrial trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Roulette has served for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to set up the moves of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Roulette said it received location records from various cell phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, refuting his previous allegations, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's cell phone for the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Telis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Telis said that he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records showed that they were only known for a week.
Roulette said that sometime after Chambers' death, Telis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its procurement on Sunday.
The judge said he estimates that later that day the trial will be put on trial by the jury.

They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are experiencing a recent recovery in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Is there another black man?
Babysitter in New York sues couple who fired her after receiving 'racist' message
A New York babysitter is suing a couple for racist redundancies after receiving a message from her mother that the latter complained that the babysitter was "another black man."
The couple denies that they are racist, comparing the treatment to "extortion".
Lynsey Flashman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she realized that the new babysitter Giselle Morris was black, just as the last one appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"OTHER BLACK" Ms. Plasko-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
As soon as she realized her gaffe, the now embarrassed Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, had not done a good job at all and was waiting in her place for a Filipina, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was rewarded for her one and only day’s work and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris has filed a lawsuit against the couple seeking compensation for the dismissal and is claiming compensation of the order of $350 a day for the six-month duration of work as an in-house nanny, for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discreet."
The couple denies claims to be racist, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris, fearing they could not trust her again after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," his wife Joel Plasko told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had insulted, even if by mistake?
Your newborn baby? Yes.
Come on now."
Comparing the treatment to "extortion," Plasko said his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you chase someone who's in this situation?
It’s not that polite,” the bank investor added.
While the legal case is underway, the court of public opinion hastened to condemn the couple on social media, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
Puddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t show interest in a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone reading it for the first time before its publication.
It’s a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the huge success of Paddington.”
She said her father, who worked as an iconographer at the BBC before inspiring to write the children's book from a teddy bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "sweetly bittersweet".
Regarding Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a fairly quiet man and he wasn't a superhero," he said.
“But because Paddington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child accomplishing something: you’re proud of it even if it’s not your accomplishment in reality.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was a creation of his own and of his own imagination, he always paid tribute to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye from the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nand kept calling and telling me that it was very bad, that he didn’t have much hope of succeeding,” said Ms. Ednan-Laperuz.
“Sometimes Nad called me to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly decreasing and leaving her body.
He had already died a little while ago and at that time and now everything was erased.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
“I had to stay cool.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouz, who has so far mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, who ignored the test she was undergoing.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I had my head down and there were tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I was dominated by a feeling of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women mourning the loss of their own faces hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide try to stop other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that can be called for support.
Ms. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a very promising chef, with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated the room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in a very bad condition".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after ending his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried there's going to be an impact."
Ms. Davis created the cards to inform the world that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt down or sad or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had fallen on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye.”
He said that his death caused them a huge trauma, but they have to overcome it: "It divides the family.
It's crushing us.
But we all have to continue and fight.”

The future of Brett Cavanaugh is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited-term and subject-matter investigation - maybe we could bring some unity," Fleick said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be dissolved amid stalemates.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwillingness is entirely due to the timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on November 6th, and if Republicans are expected to not be doing well, they will be significantly weakened in their attempt to achieve the election of the person they want in the country's supreme court.
George W. Bush calls senators, urging them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the presentation of the FBI report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to get a majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean apostates is falling under Kim's rule.
The number of dissidents from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there were 1,127 departures last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher smuggling charges had been key factors in the country’s economy.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean apostates are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the largest borders with North Korea, which are easier to cross compared to the heavily protected Militarized Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the dissidents illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often deports them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are typically still at war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the delayed denuclearisation talks.
The meeting came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to work together to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il accused U.S. sanctions of the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, under no circumstances will we unilaterally disarm our country first," Rim said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical," says he's unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unwillingly unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman behaved in this way, they would call her 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh, with intense emotion, denied the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blazi Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening bidding, Cavano was deeply moved, sometimes almost screaming, and his voice trembled as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also relentlessly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "monsterous and coordinated political assassination of character", organized by liberals who have been angry at the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Cavanaugh’s testimony proved that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he is biased against the Democrats.
“I think he blocked himself with these statements and the way he did it against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi reacted when asked if she would try to sue Cavanaugh if his appointment was confirmed and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only fit for the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s serving in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavano is a judge at the District Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or in Roy v. Wade's case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings for confirmation of his appointment, Cavano avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Isn't it time for a hysterical, biased man to go to court and wait to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
And women should have it in their possession.
It’s a justified outbreak, months and years of anger pouring out and she can’t get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
He went on to say, "I was very much helped by a woman who was a staff member somewhere, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but had developed a technique by which when she was angry and began to cry, she said to the person to whom she was talking, 'Maybe because you think I'm angry.
I'm angry."
And so he just kept going.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as an outburst of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most intense memories of a job I did in the old days, in an office dominated by men, was once when I cried with unspeakable rage and was grabbed from my neck by an older woman – a cold director who I was always afraid of – and I was slightly frightened.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they'll be glad they broke you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and abandoned the struggle humiliated, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason not to consider it.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he said, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already begun a long time ago, he was back in funding and so swore he would not enter the race if he had not raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she was very strongly charged with emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and targeting voters against her.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about the press' reactions to her.
"You would think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my gravestone?
"Cryed?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Do Good in Beijing
The greetings of the trade war between the United States and China were outrageous and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The biggest escalation evolved this week, with new tariffs on goods worth US$200 million (<0xC2><0xA3>150 million), essentially taxing half of all products imported into the US from China.
Beijing returns the fires in kind each time, while it recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to retaliate against U.S. fire, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to put it down soon.
In order to get Washington to step down, it would have to yield to their demands, but public worship in the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, U.S. trade war pressures could be positive for China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a swift political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could create the conditions for an economic collapse in either of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than has been admitted by observers in the past," said Abigail Grace, an investigative co-author of the report.
Syria is “ready” for the return of the refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muhammad said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who were forced to flee because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that hampered their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Muhammad said aid to rebuild the destroyed country was welcomed by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe locks victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 vs. 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been defeated six times in a row on European soil and has won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took the first place, as the team of Danish leader Thomas Byorn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. team star Phil Michaelston, who fought hard for the longest duration of the tournament, threw his shot into the water in par-3 16th hole, granting victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds and thus became one of the 4 players who scored 5-0-0 since the start of the current form of the tournament, in 1979.
American Jordan Spitt was defeated in 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Dano Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olsen.
The best-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, scored 2 and 1 against Ian Puller from England, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish eight-cup veteran Sergio Garcia was crowned the most successful European of all time in the tournament with a total score of 25.5.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't hold on.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy that we got the cup back.
It’s all about the team and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said, excited after the European victory.
He gives the toss to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a solo game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, grown up admiring this guy," Ram said.
Woods lost in all four of his games in France and now has a career record in the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and has been surpassed only by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a goal, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. leader Jim Farrick spoke after his team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of these kids, they fought it.
At some point this morning, we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We've fought hard.
Congrats to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup Commission and move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I’m proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
