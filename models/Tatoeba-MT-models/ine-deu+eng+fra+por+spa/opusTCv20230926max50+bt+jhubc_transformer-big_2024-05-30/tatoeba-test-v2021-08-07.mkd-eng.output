I'm just exercising to look good when I'm naked.
I need to break your neck.
I owe Tom a lot.
I owe Tom for this.
I paid a fine.
I'm planning on skipping lunch.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I prefer dogs to cats.
I prefer goat cheese to cow cheese.
I prefer the eggs from the potology.
I prefer the black one.
I'd rather sit down.
I'd rather walk alone.
I must sound ridiculous.
I promise you I won't do anything to hurt you.
I punched boxing in his jaw.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I drew the word "Alice" to highlight it.
I suggested it.
I put three tablespoons of sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I quit smoking on my knees.
I quit.
I grow cattle.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read a story to Tom.
I realized I hadn’t eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like the guilt.
I really liked your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would really be nice to be quiet.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember when I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you've made.
I cried one.
Iron is harder than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might turn.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister dropping the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
How far is Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are Potatoes Caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Is everyone having fun?
Is everything in there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I shook my head.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack.
I need to go change my clothes.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultural.
I should have checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed her my room.
Do you study outside?
Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I got him a slap in the face.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a butcher.
I slept in the room.
I slept on the bus.
I cut the sandwich in half.
Did Mike quit drinking alcoholic beverages?
I was smiling.
Isn't that exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
I spent all day cleaning the snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started to think about him.
I screwed up something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there such a word at all?
Is it Necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a prize?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is it about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Is that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
I still don't understand.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don’t understand women.
I'm still respecting Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is he funny, Tom?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested in it?
Is he looking for Tom?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You said it, Tom?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm studying art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on asking for a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm too hungry for you to bend over.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I suspected it.
I suspect that Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't even catch you burning and you being the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is the freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisers about what items to take.
It all makes sense.
It seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So, no, no, no.
That's not possible!
They're up to you for now.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, but really never, could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That would be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get so bad.
That's disappointing.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get any better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn’t matter if you don’t want to do it, you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
It doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I'm teaching Chinese.
I'm teaching him English.
It's just me.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have been created from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's cool.
It has nothing to do with happiness.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I think about it all day.
I think of him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one.
I think I have a cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm going out to eat.
I think I'm gonna go see Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice statement.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
I think I'll be okay.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French quite well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's awful.
I think that's silly.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's soulless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom is brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's tough.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's a mess.
I think Tom's a zip-locker.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's tough.
I think Tom's futile.
I think Tom's clever.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
We'd better not get into a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're panicking.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this on your own.
I think you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should get out of this on your own.
I think it's helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was caused by me.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knows where she put Mary's key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
Didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you'll have a job to do.
Didn't you like the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
So you don't hate him?
He seemed tired to me.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you could swim?
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you were better at chess than I am.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts so badly here.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup up.
This is a multi-phase process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll get the job done in a day.
Today is less humid than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Dare I use that?
I'll pay.
It doesn't come into consideration.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It’s beginning to come to our minds that we cannot ignore nature.
It's warmer today than it was yesterday.
It is worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
Somehow it seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It's happening all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
Soon it will be Christmas.
It will be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked awful.
It looked ridiculous.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very tasty.
It looks different.
It seems familiar to me.
Looks like an egg.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday, my head's up, I'm really resentful.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
The two of them seem to have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks good.
That's how I got closer to Tom.
It's made me feel better.
You're worrying me.
It can be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
It may seem strange.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could be raining today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my dad died when I was thirteen.
I told you this was gonna be painful.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm done.
I came back by bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
I got my pants off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally get it.
It probably won't be worth the wait.
He came back two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulties.
I tried to explain it to him, but not the button.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I'm really sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to turn.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the medication you were prescribed.
It's a kid's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
Everything is in the room.
It's all over for us.
Now it's all over.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over in a little while.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She'll have to leave soon.
It's a lot of fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
I'm honored.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a false clue.
It's a risky plan.
It's a pity that the concrete doesn't burn.
It's fast enough on foot.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They dismantled it.
It's just Paki's doing it to me.
He's been coming back for about a week.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is very warm.
It's best if you don't talk that much.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and deceived than to be pessimistic and be right.
“It’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.”
It's empty.
The sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
Study here.
It's generally known that you're not dear Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
Definitely they are.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his abilities.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
Looks like I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
Looks very well-written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's a bad thing to gossip.
It's exactly 10 o'clock.
That's what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's ridiculous.
Watching TV is a lot of fun.
Get dressed.
It's darkening.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's going to be beastly.
It'll get even cooler.
It's gonna happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's a good training.
It's good. It's good.
It's gotten better.
It's a lot of fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
It's important to me what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great condition.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just fiction.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It is made of leather.
It's up to me, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not how it happened.
It won’t be easy to do it without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's nothing scary.
It's not just a guess.
It's not just a pen.
There is not enough light to read.
It's not that we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not ridiculous.
It's not that little.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
Apparently it's a print error.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds really strong.
That sounds very good.
Our job is to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He probably still has it.
It's probably still available.
It's a hole.
In fact, it's very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really nasty.
It's a pity.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It still doesn't work.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It is strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy foods like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best shampoo I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
Thunders out, I'm terrified.
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Epten is strong.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
You can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It relaxes a lot.
It's very easy to understand.
It's hot in here.
I guess that's all right.
There's a wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water only takes three minutes to boil.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the light.
I turned off the TV.
I rejected Tom.
It was an honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a disgrace.
It was after midnight.
It was an arena day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
It was all so easy.
It was an amazing evening.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
It was a tribute to me spending the evening with a smart, bright and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful evening.
That kind of behavior was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was overnight.
It was dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been shown that flea living on dogs jump higher than those living on cats.
It was so majestic.
It was pretty funny.
Epten was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was blowing a lot.
It was amazing.
You had to.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's hanging on the fireplace.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was pathetic.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inconceivable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Beth.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Lies won't help.
That's not gonna help you.
It's working well.
It would be perfectly normal for you to get mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I get to explain everything to you.
I need you urgently.
I used to protect you.
I used to dream of being a dancer.
I hated you before.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I have already written everything that needs to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone has always helped me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to something like this.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her a cake.
