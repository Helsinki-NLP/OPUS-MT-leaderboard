Welsh National Assembly Members Concerned They “Look Like Mappets”
Some members of the Assembly were surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This resulted from plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this may be the subject of mockery.
A Labour Party assembly member said his party was concerned that it was “rhyming with Twp and Pwp.”
For those who do not speak Welsh: in Welsh, twp means "foolish/crazy", and pwp means "how".
A Plaid member said the party was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party was "free-spirited" about the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "Muppet" was great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce changes to the name, stated: "The final decision on any words by which members of the Assembly will be appointed, of course, will be made by the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on proposals that indicated strong support for the appointment of the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the question of the name of the Assembly Members, the committee prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support from public consultations.
MPs are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could cause headaches for House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill for the changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualifying members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will give a final vote on the question of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was set in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a right to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Shut as Harlem Churches Face Trouble
“Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there is neither.”
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods where people go regularly.”
And for churches, he’s concerned that the money from the sale of the properties won’t last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later, they’ll return to the same place they started.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings full of type of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“Most of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white,” he said, “and therefore the day will come when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who settle in those apartments will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by congregations of whites before Harlem became the metropolis of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original Congregation of White Methodists moved in in the 1930s.
The Congregation of Blacks practicing their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Congregation of Blacks during the reign of Priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of sellers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was heavily damaged in a fire in 1939, but because members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the Carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the Carillon “the bell of the poor.”
The expert who played Carillon in July called it a "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to the larger carillon at the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, partly brought by the inexperienced leaders of the church, and partly by the episcopal diocese.
The ecclesiastical board – the church’s governing body, made up of incompetent leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would “request a transfer of expenses” to the ecclesiastical board, although the ecclesiastical board was not involved in the hiring process.
Some members of the parish complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Child During Lobster Scuba Diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobsters season, authorities said.
The attack took place around 7:00 p.m. near Encinitas Beach.
Chad Hamel told KSWB in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed to the group to help pull him out of the water.
Hamel stated that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a lobster, but then "he realized that he was yelling, 'I'm late!
It was a bitch!’
His entire cleft was visible," Hamel said, noting that he had reached the boy.
“I called for everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the children's hospital Raddy in San Diego, where he was brought in as if in a critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but they decided the shark was not a dangerous species.
Gils added that the victim had acquired traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities have closed the beach from the side of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Gils noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of warehouses full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant penetration into the UK beauty market weighing 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales decline, the big beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country after more years, and will become increasingly popular.
The investment in beauty emerged after supermarkets began looking for ways to take advantage of the space of the rafting that was once intended for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its offer of beauty products to 3,000 for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup series, so most of the products are vegan-friendly, something that is increasingly in demand from younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Craydon, south London, last week, and the second opened in Sely Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, director of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like warehouses as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discounters with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's began putting Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they said increased grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreements over how to split profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a must-have beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Is 'Angry' After Holly Willoughby Withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Den left "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
The couple's business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This 37-year-old host of the morning program said on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, retiring from their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the television golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5million and more - meant that she no longer had time to waste.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby said on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK in one of his cottages.
A source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all the affected catches them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the opening.
There's a warehouse at Marlow's headquarters full of ready-to-sell products."
Experts believe the departure of this morning show host, who is one of Britain’s highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions because of large investments in pillow and candlestick products, as well as clothing and household products, and because of the potential for further delays.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple go on vacation together and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We are not commenting on his business ventures.”
A serious conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media for commenting that some would consider “non-presidential” and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much of his time?
Trump said with his voice disguised as a “news presenter.”
“I didn’t give up on anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump rated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“We are very much in agreement with North Korea,” he said.
“We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great collaboration.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: they had completed missile tests, helped release hostages, and the remaining U.S. troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroyed Island and Killed Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no elementary disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not seeking international aid, so it is a challenge," Mr Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palu, it is still not certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that are constantly hitting Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of times, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Widodo's election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko’s administration in the eyes of the next year’s re-election.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starrige from Liverpool tied against Chelsea
Daniel Oldege saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Oldie about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1–0.
He shifted the ball from the left side before pointing it to the far-away tripod.
The ball moved high above sixteen as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the bounced Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get in that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shack are always serving as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible," he told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and I just touched her and I didn’t think much about it and I just shot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The striker of the "blue" passed with a fifth back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost to half the pitch, and then sprinted to half of Liverpool.
They quickly passed with Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then pointed a missile, leading Hazard to the sixteenth.
Hazard crossed the defense and finished in the grid of the long-distance tripod with a left-footed punch alongside Alison Becker at Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and caused waves at a height of 20 feet, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho spokesman said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overwhelmed by a blast from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched since the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with Grayson Moves stab wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken pictures of something on the cameras of the cars to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in the building.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and, as the police said, they will inform the people close to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Moves just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him he was not allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told that it would take hours before they could return.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
She keeps saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were at the border, and another was outside.
Several police officers stood at the border and watched the apartments.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters at 0800 555 111 citing record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament became the latest memorial in the fight for "rewriting history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor derived by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the deeds of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell's wonderful presentation of Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many believe, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and mention.”
Pig Killer Smashs and Kills Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Juan", was found dead with a cut artery, spilled in blood near a stop in a market in Liupanshui in Gizhou province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xinying in Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found an open door from the neighboring pig farm.
He said there was a big pig in the hamstring with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig split the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said the cousin, given the surname Wu, according to a quote in the evening news of Guayang.
The footage from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people as police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a <0xC2><0xA3>650 pig clamped a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife kicked the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an “activator.”
“They’re just playing.”
They like to snack, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone intentionally.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring rain in the southwestern part of the United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
The rose brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane from 5.00 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward towards the western coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to introduce large tropical moisture north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rose will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create heavy rainfall in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, a flow of rubble and possible landslides in the desert.
Large tropical moisture will cause rainfall that in some places will be about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to the rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to go to the desert on foot in the event of tropical rain.
The occasional rain can cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause rivers of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region since their wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday morning, before the rain spreads more late on Monday and Tuesday.
The rain will spread to the “four corners” on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, temperature changes are expected throughout the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropics remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
A good example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates the possibility of above-average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony on Thursday of nominated Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the resultless political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular turnaround programs at the last minute since Friday: Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, signed a deal with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh was playing the piano and trying to strip her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as reported by Nielsen, saw it on Friday.
The company had an average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks that featured it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look in offices.
To show it better, it is an audience with a size similar to that of a football playoff match or the Film Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After the Republican office moderately issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him shouting at protesters Friday morning as he tried to enter the elevator for the court committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as they rebuked him, and all this was broadcast live on CNN.
“They’re standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power, and so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator door, there would be more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks all covered hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote for the advancement of Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI to consider the charges against the nominee next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Cohns.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was of great importance because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the UK's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview right next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" Brexit plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should "appreciatively collect each other's expenses".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Deaton Simson over death of Louisiana State University athlete
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Deaton Simpson has been arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, a WAFB partner told CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting at Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the parish pathologist at East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the area's citizens for their help in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for her “activity in pursuit of justice.”
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot beck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
“This is what you care about all the time,” the coach said.
Volcano throws ashes over Mexico City
Ejecting ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern settlements of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Sunday not to head towards the volcano after starting activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center followed several tattoos and shakes.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City’s populated areas, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity on the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police for public order and peace and thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing voice for secession.
A group of masked supporters of the separatists held by police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into the powder, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights also broke out, and police used sticks to suppress the fights.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups shouted “No forgetting, no forgiving” and, on the other hand, the union protesters shouted “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions are still high in the independence-seeking region, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but the same was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the turnout was small because of the boycott by people opposed to secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcissos Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would have a chance to gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I watched my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep up the momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders either in self-elected persecution or in detention awaiting trial for their undeclared role in organizing re-election.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, filming the police support protest, said the conflict was backed by politicians on both sides.
“Everything is becoming potential,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before a trial last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonders arrested after stabbing a car in a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly stabbing a car in a London-based house.
The incident took place in Balinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said damage was caused to the gate and the building itself.
At some point, it could be shot with an arrow to the car.
Menga's season brought Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Advanced Livingstone beat the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with only two losses in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's weather proved significant as Gary Hold's side climbed to a level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's side has been left without a guest win this season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind them by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston remain undefeated in the division for six games, and coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the toughest guests.
Holt's team had to lead long before they scored, and their directness caused a lot of trouble to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough, but pulled the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts from a distance after sliding off Craig Halkett's head over the goal.
The guests gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the set actions.
That’s how the final goal came to be.
The Rangers missed a free-kick, and Livingston won the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson scoring together against Menga, who only touched a goal from the centre of the sixteen.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball, but could not break through the defense of the hosts, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not play for the most part.
That pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos effected Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgow took the ball away from another set action at Livingston.
Livingstone’s sixteen-year-old was constantly passed and defended, while two requests for a penalty – after Halkett’s challenge for replacing Glenn Middleton and one for playing with his hand – were rejected.
“The Phenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni arena
Fantastic Game and Score for Livingstone
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this uphill path.
Their style and playing character barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Conor Goldson and Joe Voral on hold.
The Rangers were still lacking in inspiration.
As good as they once were under Gerard, they now lag behind by the same standards.
Their last game was weak – they only managed to open the hosts once – and that’s a little awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have worsened due to problems including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also protested, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposite protesters portray the visitor's division, famous as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist died in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The clash occurred near the intersection of Westwood and Evelyn Streets, a highway in Deptford, southeast of the city at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and came to the emergency room, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash occurred months after another cyclist died in a traffic accident on Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Blockades have been placed on the road and buses have been diverted and it is recommended that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six prison police officers were injured in riots in the high-security male prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special forces from the Tornado unit were brought in to resolve the riots, which included eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
The prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were instructed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the Public Order and Peace Police were summoned to prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (may be useful for dry areas)
A tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, bringing the risk of sudden flooding.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, all the way to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Phoenix.
Rosa is expected to move on a direct path through the Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile range on the Phoenix since 1950!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane within a range of 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mongol border of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated areas up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risky areas of sudden flooding, the rain of Rose can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Authority, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides everywhere on the Lower California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-force on Sunday morning with winds of up to 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes into contact with cooler waters in the Pacific and is decreasing.
Therefore, rainfall is expected in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
“A rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain,” weather.com said.
Rose will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is the very heavy rainfall in Lower California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," the Center for Hurricanes said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening sudden floods and streams of debris, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teen was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace on Midsomer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and was in a "stable" condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had a cell phone footage of the incident to step down.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the utmost anger and anger" of the Democratic Party.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s harshest and most outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the utmost anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying accusations of Christina Blasi Ford committing a sexual assault on her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality, and courage" that day.
“The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the significance of the Republican exit in early elections.
“Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
"I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
“I’m everywhere and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key vote for Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP chief told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many taken away by huge waves hitting beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of 6 meters (18 feet) high hit the shore of the sunset, taking many to certain death and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, a tsunami struck.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mediation agency, said in a statement.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy released by the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow shore, is likely to amplify the magnitude of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the shelling of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could increase along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" from the Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came about at the same time as the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of a building can be heard shouting in amazement, warning people down the street of the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water bursts onto the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video right away.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where employees took refuge in shelters from the tarpaulins in the yard of their office, they passed through scenes of devastation along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began dark attempts to start aid for the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial support, stockpiles and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn’t happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Auliya Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we may receive international aid, but it still has no status.”
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the wonders that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the gun for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendo Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian state paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others who were stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gandon recounted how, when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paraglider community began to circulate, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray tick sign, instead of a blue one.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the quay
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was replenishing an ATM at Newport on the quay, according to a press release from the Newport police station.
The driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "runned from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yej
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yay.
He posted the change on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
Forty-one-year-old West was nicknamed Yay for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place just before his tour on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who had to give up for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yej' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means 'you' there," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s me, it’s you, it’s me, it’s me.
He went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye, the reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Hunter and Brother Hunter (Love and Brother Love).
A former West associate, Jay-Z, also uses his name with or without a bullet and all capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico vows not to use military on civilians
Mexico’s Vice President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The military fired at peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A doubling of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the odds that the next major achievement in the area of AI will be made by the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of SinoVation+ Ventures, the largest company in the world.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranking American hotel player, and later served as director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Li thanked the U.S. government for its previous technology competitions as the challenge in the robotics of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next competition would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often need to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders, it’s the corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should automatically be offered to doctors of sciences for artificial intelligence,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other government organizations donate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Artificial Intelligence Authority Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called “AI Next”.
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation requiring the creation of the National Commission on the Security of Artificial Intelligence has not worked for months.
Macedonians are voting in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to “Republic of North Macedonia,” a move that would settle a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its EU and NATO membership requests.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents putting right on its territory and vetoing its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that that price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Djorgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout stood at 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters gave their votes.
“I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko gave their vote at the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small scene and tables in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads up high, not from the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I believe the majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said the "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Thelma, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since they came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguare passes all Brighton's defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton's defense in a 2–0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed between three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "greens".
He bypassed a defensive player before running several others on the edge of Brighton's sixteen-year-old.
He then turned to the left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker took advantage of his first comeback to the 16-year-old to return the ball to Aguero, who defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a single blow to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal in that moment.”
But the Sky Blues' initial advantage was given by Sterling in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before taking Sterling to the distant tripod.
The attack of the "heavenly blues" brought the ball into the net before it went out.
City will face Hofenheim in a Champions League group match at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler against Rocky
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Shercere hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies team, who lead with one match ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Roxie's team had at least a "joker" for a 5–2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still struggling to secure their place in the first division.
“While we’re not playing for anything, at least we’ll be able to throw in knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level from any moment I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals are yet to announce a starter for a week, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start on the 34th time, trained throwing on Thursday and will throw normally rested on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18–7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout points in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as he talked about the importance of Republicans' exit in early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be put on the line in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
“This is one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but I’m really fighting, so I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
“You see these terrible, terrible groups of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their power using all the means at their disposal, you see the evil, the disgust.
They don’t care who they hurt, when they have to run in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we won’t give them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, vicious, ugly and untrue.”
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein from the Democratic ranks, appointed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by a name to which the audience responded with shouts of indignation.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, and no, wait a minute, it was a very bad body language, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour no longer accepts different opinions.
They don’t tolerate those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last member of parliament from the Labor Party to be told that we are not welcome – only because he expresses his opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she took a firm stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the East Labor Party at Nottingham stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the Labor Party, the council meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of most meetings today, and the promise of a “mild, gentle” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labor Party, and each opinion is judged to be acceptable to the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would otherwise never have taken, whether it was about national security or about the future.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn’t matter what I say, there is critical harassment on social media that calls for condemnation, denial of the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labor Party.
I’m not the only one with that experience.
In fact, I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist harassment every day, but never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labor Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions, and with every request for “no confidence” or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not be so loud, and then “it’s going to be okay.”
But that’s not why I came into politics.
Even 32 years ago, when I joined the Labor Party as a student, provoked by Thatcher’s government’s carelessness that literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those most in need, whether as a local counselor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday’s demand, all I want to say is that when the country goes to Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But I have a message that is not about Nottingham Momentum, but about my constituents, regardless of whether they are members of the Labor Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how damning threats or political opportunism I will survive with the most interest that will not deter me in any way.
Chris Lesley is a member of Parliament for East Nottingham.
Ear 38 – 17 Melrose: the unbeaten Ear goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match of the day from the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as their better-used chances, which the home team took away, and coach Peter Murci has a right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Pophalba for Ears, they've taken their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Climo, gave Ear an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggott ungrasped.
Climate extended Ear's lead with a penalty, before, exactly halfway, he scored a point, then converted a solo point to score 17–5 for Ear in the rescue.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long detention due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was carried on a stretcher, and from the start, Ear continued to struggle with the point of Stafford McDoval, converted by Clima.
Ear's deputy captain, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of the time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to defeat Climax without the ball, McFerson won a touchdown from the penalty line on the back of the sharp Ear attack.
Clima converted, as he did again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took the blow from David Armstrong and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
‘Still Game’ star looks set for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiran seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The fifty-six-year-old is played by Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, of which he is a screenwriter and co-star with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the next ninth season will be the last and it looks like Kirnan is planning for life after Kregleng.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source said Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes court will reopen path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a disguised navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have set up a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are stamped with the motto: “The sea is ours with right.
It is our duty to return.”
Across mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the desire to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course it expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzada, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the international court on the big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of the Bolivian lawsuit that, after decades of evolving talks, Chile is bound to agree to negotiate an agreement to bring the matter to an end.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also depends heavily on Monday's verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he solemnly said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to rule in their favor.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate territory to Chile and said it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The International Court of Justice’s ruling comes only six months after the final arguments indicate that the case “has not been complicated,” said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And the last four years may have reversed the cause of Bolivia instead of improving it.
“The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes,” Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia an “incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreement,” he said.
Calzada also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the sea problem as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ree said it was "fictional" to believe that prolonged sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaring end to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the Pyongyang Declaration without first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows unveil the latest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest shops in your area
If you want to improve the size of your collection of hats or completely block the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of crazy oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent out their creations that are eye-catching on the track.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide rim in the form of feathers that overwhelmed the head of the model.
Other oversized supplements included circus watermelons, magic hats, and even pineapples, but they aren’t designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving gear entirely with glasses and a diving tube, and the other looked like a melted ice cream cornet.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats can come in stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after “La Bomba”, the two-foot-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The iconic fashion house behind the too impractical hat that spread through social media sent another big creation on the runway, a straw beach bag the size almost equal to the height of the model it was pulling.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia border and a white leather handle, was the piece featured in Jacques’s La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in stores next summer, because the designer made such a huge impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language Skills are Necessary for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and group success in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement tailored school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable as an elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will make him arrogant.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will strike him in the soul.”
This is a strong reminder that we can’t rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved a higher score of “5+”.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher "5+" rating in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an elective, are seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school programs, as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 OK Commission on Employment and Skills survey found that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for failing to fill jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, and French was the only language spoken by more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those in developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in OK when looking into the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this has to be embodied in schools.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
"Il faut bien le faire" (it must be done).
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will lead the Lakers to their San Diego debut on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first game of the preseason on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play has not yet been decided.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudel, tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training at the start of the week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game schedule before the Lakers season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
YouTube channel for Trump rally in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
President Donald Trump began a series of rallies as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five Trump rallies scheduled next week, including visits to favorite places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court is on hold, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans may lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. East Coast Time Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia via the internet live on YouTube.
This week, it is likely that Trump will address the hearing of the man nominating him for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected postponement of the vote in the Senate until a week later.
The primary goal of the rally series is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
Hence, from President Trump's campaign, they said that these five rallies next week are aimed at "incentivizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives."
“Congressional control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many allied states as possible with the start of a tough campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, the evening rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro news.
On Saturday, it was Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a country he won by more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of polls,” said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team showed courage in fighting to keep hopes alive at the start of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the four on Saturday afternoon may have been just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The reversal of luck is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such matches.
Who would say that happiness is now?
“They had a six-point lead, and now it’s four, so we’re a little lucky, I guess,” Jordan Spit said after the end of today’s race.
The Europeans have the advantage, of course, of a four-point lead and twelve more games.
Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the sails even though they have a sufficient impetus, if nothing else the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Sleep was great and leads by example.
Those loud shouts of celebration became more and more loud throughout his game, with a key blow leading to a four-to-four draw when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His punch with which they won the 15th match was met with a similar call, one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
“You just have to go deeper and take care of your game,” Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for every player.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but wonderful duo of Europe are four out of four and can’t go wrong.
Mollywood were the only pair without bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensured that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players who will provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, except for Flintwood or Molinari.
They prefer the two at the same time on different holes.
However, talks about European fame remain unjustified.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simson quickly coped with Sergio Garcia, the morning doubles hero, when he teamed up with Alex Norren.
A missed punch and two doubles out of the top nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and quads are so fascinating to watch from close up because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t obey, and the way the strategy can be changed at once.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved a significant lead in the last day, but the four-season also showed that the U.S. team can fight although some, especially Americans, doubted.
The Europeans lead 10-6 in the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter with a solid lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday’s lead in doubles and fours of 10-6 ahead of the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf National by four points.
The European team of Thomas Björn, who fought to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team, which had a lot of shortcomings in the morning doubles and won the series 3-1.
The Americans offered more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but were unable to reach the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points out of 12 individual matches a week to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair ever to score four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in doubles, they played great and defeated worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Deshambu with an even more pronounced 5&4 score.
Woods, who passed through two games on Saturday, played great at times, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in doubles and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested while the morning doubles lasted, returned as a partner to Henrik Stanson in the four-match 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans did not have that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-point mark for Americans on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 victory over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and returned later to defeat Pulter and Rory McLroy by 4&3 in the fours, but lost in the starting, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a certain team has recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as the title holders, Furik's team was satisfied with an equal score to keep the trophy.
After being the second two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says there's "no chance" of unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that prolonged sanctions deepened mistrust in the United States and that there was no chance the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Jong Ho told the World Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” last year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities, and committing to technology and nuclear proliferation.
“However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there will be no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to "in-stage" access to nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement appeared significant because it did not disarm, disarmament unilaterally, disarmament.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit of the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula," he said.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington is also refusing to give in to tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes the ‘end of war declaration,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a futile dream for people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem were South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have ended."
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles to the U.S. mainland was inevitable since "Mr. Evil President" Trump said.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, much later praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain pending North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for it, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “Security Council sanctions must continue in full and without exception until full, finally nuclear disarmament is confirmed.”
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but last time it didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea after only a few hours due to "gangster demands".
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month for disarmament of a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was demanding were the security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Attend Courses to Get Enough Rest
Harvard University’s new course this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to combat the growing male-culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing when it comes to basic self-care.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of dream medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, designed the course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech on the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, last year?’
She said no one, never told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a student's home where students squeeze coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart and stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know — just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette,” Professor Chaizler added.
A culture of pride with “work all night” still exists, he said, and besides, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to switch to a mode of starvation, which makes them more hungry.
Raymond Soue, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physical biology from California, helped Professor Chaizler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaiseler advised students to think about setting an alarm about when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the electronic screens and the LED light, which causes the circadian displacement.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal knocked down Gerard's men
The Rangers endured another defeatful, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerard's squad down 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win since the February 4–1 triumph at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team scored a second defeat to Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left their team with eight points behind the league's runaway leading team Hart.
Menga scored seven minutes ahead of halftime and Rangers' line-up lost inspiration and chances of equalization.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth place, and Livingston have climbed to third and are only behind Hibernian by the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers since Line Judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after he was apparently hit with an object from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 of Livingston who scored with Harts last week and would be delighted with the way his well-trained line-up stifled opponents at every chance.
The Rangers may have dominated possession over the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after the start when Menga's first loss pushed Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
Then a long-distance strike from Keehan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in the defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should get a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Lawles clashed, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not give a sign of approval to the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots to the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get wet by Lasana Kulibali's header and Ovi Edaria's weaker shot.
Although the start of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been the opposite during the game, no one can deny that they deserved it according to their game.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs's blow.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cold head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gérard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a blockade.
But Livingston managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoy, with Litgow and Hackett catching up with many of the long additions.
Holt's team could extend the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set up well and prevented Jacobs before Litgow played head-to-head corner.
Replacing the Rangers, Glenn Middleton had another request for a penalty after colliding with Jacobs, but Thompson again approved.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one side of our almanac "In the morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE DECIDE ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a major hub of science and popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Bells of Colorado, starring the seemingly incredulous, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that again?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity emits in the minerals.
Evans: “Say, it must be jumping now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Removed Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to “View” Removed Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize removed cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory.
You can “see” a protein common in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the body
The trial vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize removed cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, altering them in the lab so they can "see" a protein common in many cancers called HER2, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofski explained.
A similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and their "learning" how to target cancer cells works in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump breakout, wearing a cap with his motto, after a live performance on Saturday night.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, after a useless performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called The City of Ghosts, in which he wore a cap with the inscription “Make America Glorious Again,” he began to criticize Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to a white man they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The Saturday evening live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee on the allegations of sexual assault of Christine Blaise Ford.
Although not aired, the footage of West's fall was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time getting behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They were laughing at me.
They told me, “Don’t come here with that hat.”
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in the sink, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" he said that he would "put his superman capsule on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
“Try it with love.”
His comments attracted outrage from the audience at least twice, and the crew of the evening show seemed embarrassed, reports Variety, one man said of the publisher: "The whole studio is taking over."
West was introduced as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
Vest surprised many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPSAD, Candice Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest ghosts: I THANK YOU for resisting the ball."
But the show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was her own and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and he is now "formally known as Caine West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Paff Dedi, Paff Dedi and Paff Didi.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, is named Snoop Lion and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist from previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakmor, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast High Court on Monday.
Prosecutions will be heard by the Public Prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star, Keith Harrington, has attacked toxic masculinity.
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the macho-hero stereotype when he stated that such screen roles often mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the culture section of the Sunday Times, Keith said he believes "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #NowSay.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted he has "strong feelings" about the matter.
“I personally have strong feelings, at the moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is learned from TV, and what on the street, makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
Because it’s obvious that something’s wrong with the young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in the Game of Thrones sequels when the series ends next summer, saying it "finished with battles and horses."
From November, Keith will perform in Sam Shepard's True West Remake, which is a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me the future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played Gamer, a character who had a love attraction to Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantasy series that won the Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new incidents were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data provided by a staff member associated with a Republican senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican senators in the U.S. on Wikipedia’s lawmakers’ pages.
The L.A. Democrat assured that the allegations were on “ultra-right” sympathizers and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly included the home address and telephone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday, released by an unknown person at Capitol Hill as the Senate hearing panel lasted on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge.
The information appeared shortly after Kavanaugh's questioning by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redstead have announced that the IP address that identifies the source of the post is linked to the Waters office and information about a Waters staff member has been published, Hill said.
“These unfortunate accusations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of those false and false accusations – is in no way responsible for the information provided.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Flachscher.
“These denials are nerve-wracking,” Flacher wrote.
“This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be challenged.
He is not allowed to question the motives of the accused.
He has to stay calm and calm.”
Fletcher apparently compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also announced on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s a big deal,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had reported "fake allegations to the relevant institutions and police.
“We will allow the offenders to be identified,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all of my staff.”
Johnny English Attacks Again - Undermined Rowan Atkinson's Spy Scams
It is now traditional to look for elements of Brexit in every new film with a British connection, and this seems to be true for this reboot of the franchise of the fraudulent, action comedy Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-born in 2011 with Johnny Ingles:
Will the careful self-sacrifice of the topic of how obvious we are to nowhere be the new export opportunity that the nation has?
Despite this, the incompetent Johnny English's face with big eyes and a lot of make-up was given a license to "fry" things a second time - his name first and foremost indicates that he is a comic creation with a wide scope, made for viewers in cinemas in places where English is not spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for attentive glamour, resembles Clouseau, has Mr. Bin's drawings and a part of the boy playing a note from the song "Coches on Fire" from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Its basis is traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once starred in Barclays' now-forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I really liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy may be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy accidents aren’t as inventive and focused as they are the dumbest bits of Atkinson’s character.
The problem is that the UK is in serious trouble all the time.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated a super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of an agent on duty – a disappointingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson gives herself in this quasi-Theresa May character, but there is nothing special in the script that would work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling himself Johnny English, who now works as a private school teacher, but "in black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good guys here, when English offers a school for spying that looks like a rock academy.
English was promptly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former associate Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in a relationship with a commander of a submarine, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for messing up all the things in the Royal Secret Service, are back in action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Buletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the vicious Jason Walt, portrayed by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd actions: dressed as waiters they burn a French restaurant; they make a desolation after smuggling themselves on the luxury yacht of the Walt; and English embarks on a real anarchy when he tries to use a helmet for a whirlwind.
All brakes are removed for the final sequence, but as kind and noisy as it is, there is a lot of children's TV throughout the film.
Nice temperate things.
And like the other films with Johnny English, I can’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to use his talent?
Labour denies plans for the British to work four days a week, but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week – but be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants corporate bosses to harness the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would get the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea “matches” with the party’s economic agenda and plans for the country to be more favored by the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high-ranking member of the party told the Sunday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that is consistent with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to adopt such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party does not consider such an idea.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of “faceless directors” and “profiteers” in utilities.
The Chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get back the full share because the Labour government could make “deductions” for unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of the company's boards and create Inclusive Property Funds with which 10 percent of private companies' capital will be allocated to employees, who can receive an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy give a statement on "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI investigation of Cavanaugh could reconsider them
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and updated the question of whether the bureau's findings could be reconsidered by some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Peley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them think again.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I think so,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, however, looks like it's embedded in a rock.
“My decision has been made for Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking charge is needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett was denying it vigorously,” Graham added, thinking of Christine Blacey Ford.
“Everyone she mentioned could not confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new to change.”
What is the Global Citizens’ Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features celebrity stars and has an impressive mission; end to poverty.
It is now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will come to the large lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by names like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or some other useful task that will help raise awareness.
But how successful is a Global Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole thing?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask for something, or just another case of “click-activism” – people who feel like they’re making a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million “activities” from supporters, who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped drive world leaders to announce commitment and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and announcements resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion has already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that fundraising has a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers dedicated to “helping children unleash their potential”, which promises to provide $35 million for Rwanda to help with under-nutrition in the country.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition, a landmark in history,” said Ambassador Tracy Ulman of Power of Nutrition, in front of the crowd at the 2018 live concert in London.
The group also said over 5,000 activities were undertaken in connection with calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult journey – we will never succeed.
But like the big civil and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy to block Russia's energy exports - Interior Ministry
Washington may “if necessary” use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinky said, citing Washington Exeter.
According to Zinki, Russian involvement in Syria – namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a screen for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just like they are in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to block their energy from reaching the market,” he said.
Zinki addressed attendance at an event organized by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a nonprofit group that portrays itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, to raise the stakes and replace fuels,” he said, while speaking of Russia as an “unpleasant pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement followed after the Trump administration began a mission to encourage liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to deviate from the “inappropriate” Norden-Tek 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-billion-dollar North Tek 2 pipeline should double its current capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance met with resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the first member of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) since the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider carefully" whether to run for president in 2020, Senator from Massachusetts said.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Holioc City Council in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, and that means a woman at the forefront,” she said.
“After November 6, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.”
Warren assessed President Donald Trump’s work during a city council meeting and said he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he appoints as Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think she should not run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Center for Political Research at the University of Saffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support such a proposal.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination and 48 percent opposing it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic Party discussed for the 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially make a decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Trek Palin’s postraumatic syndrome at Donald Trump rally
Trek Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"After what my son is going through, what he is going through after he's back, I know how other families who have been torn apart by postraumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with," she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans "are coming back a little differently, they are coming back solidified, they are coming back and they are wondering if there is any respect for what they and their fellow aviation officers have for each other."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Vasila Police.
18 states and the city of Washington support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support challenging a new U.S. policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition in court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who disputes politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" were abusing her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
Grace’s defense attorney described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a number of U.S. asylum applications originate, as nations with persistent problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 Immigrant Complaints Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington, D.C. Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation being passed at federal, federal and international levels.”
“Federal law requires all applications for asylum to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the application and such a provision violates that principle,” according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, advocates in the letter argue that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the U.S. are detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs “to offer the necessary workforce.”
Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“There is asylum for those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said at the June 11 policy presentation.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu as the number of victims has doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is extremely serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her male baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
Residents return to their destroyed homes and pick from their alleged objects to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who has fractures of the back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent subsequent minor earthquakes.
Tears popped into his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think so," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife ask for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘harming’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper listing the mutual benefit of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday talked about China's paid addition to the De Moin Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, China dismissed the accusation.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election has prompted U.S. services to Reuters, a new stage in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to publish ads promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which they align import tariffs with each other.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from allied states like Iowa, which support Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and American experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing was hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the De Moin Register, "is now doubling the harassment with propaganda ads in our free press."
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is abusing the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by placing ads in the De Moin Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Conversely, in the nearby newspaper stand here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not really see the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s problematic economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the firm hand of China,” he said.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China has rejected his offer to publish" the column, although he did not say which newspaper it is.
Republicans are moving away from women's votes ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warn
As many Republicans fail to observe or defend Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already stated that they want to continue with the vote.
There is no turning back from such things," wrote Grant Reicher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell College of the University of Syracuse, to Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richard said he suspected that pressure on the FBI to investigate Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican) would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is Coming!" at a protest in the Senate hallway, when Republicans, who have control of the Legal Affairs Committee, decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be high,” said Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
“People are already saying they are tall; that’s right.
But they can be higher, especially among independent women voters in the suburbs and young voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting in the committee or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh is going to go to the hearing, it’s about how Republicans handled this and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans are divided about who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, although most accept the first-mentioned side.
A new Yu-Gov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Cavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Cavanaugh probably or definitely lied in the testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same of Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one more, of Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, under oath, last week that Cavanaugh had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court candidate of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup business that claims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrapt, is a company built on the open source platform Solid, at Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he told the start-up business.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "online data store" or abbreviated POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Sleek, and Spotify to all be available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about personal data storage on the Internet is that it only depends on the user who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrapt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with the resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers with a contract to work on the project, and a community of encoders-volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change where their business models are completely flipped overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a press release, Berners-Lee said, “Inrupt’s mission is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Consortium of the World Network of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Lately, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesman in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m a big optimist for the new era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Famous bearer of a Victorian cross from World War I
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victorian Cross during the First World War as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received recognition on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Belengliz and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military award.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was an "incredible symbol" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "below a very thick fog and under a strong fire of cannons and machine guns."
He later ran to the spots from where he was shooting and with "the greatest courage" led ahead, before attacking a cannon nest himself and incapacitating three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that makes us humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Van also placed a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Van said he was "honored to be a part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
Combined martial arts fans stayed awake all night to watch the Belator 206, instead getting Pepa Pig
Imagine, you are awake all night to watch the Beacon 206 without having the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card being shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gérard Mussasey and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were thrilled when the channel switched to Pepa Pig.
Some weren’t impressed since they stayed awake until early hours due to the fight.
One of Twitter’s fans described switching to a children’s cartoon fill as “some painful joke.”
"The law is that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," Dave Schwartz, Belator's vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the transmission.
"Pepa Pig," yes.
The company's chairman, Belator Scott Cooker, said they would work on a schedule that would include viewers from Britain in the future.
“I think when I think about releasing, I think we can probably find a solution,” Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution on Sunday in our time and Monday in their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we received a lot of messages during the transfer and none of them was benevolent.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn’t, it was a legal issue.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We’ll limit the number of fights to five, instead of six – as we usually do – we’ve tried to deliver more for the fans and exaggerated.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discs on a deserted island: Tom Daley felt "inferior" to sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality — but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “everyone is not like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4's first "Discs on a Desert Island" show, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
Regular presenter of the long-running show Kirsty Young, took a months-long vacation due to illness.
Appearing as a supporting character in Laverne's first show, Dale said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and diversity were the things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-bronze medal-winning Olympian has become a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at an early age” – he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said "all his views" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father refused to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to be here to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew this was what I’ve dreamed of my whole life – jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song – Pride of Heather Small – which revolved around his head in preparation for the Olympics and which he was still amused by.
Discs on a deserted island on BBC Radio 4 are on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michelson, the horse is not in shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup, but will have to change shape to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Michaelson, who played at the beehive, a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furick during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Rather than being in the spotlight, as the United States often represents, the five-time winner, he divided the time to cheer and practice his game, on the range, in the hopes of fixing what was bothering him.
Never been the best leader, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the narrow golf course of Le Golf National, where distant rough kicks are a regular penalty for inattention.
And if the field itself isn’t scary enough, Michelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who plays in pairs with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are missing four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Mikkelson’s game could be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, touched my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furick said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a part of the celebrities and has given a lot to these teams last week and this week.
I didn’t think he was playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's what happened, and we thought that's what we had to do.
He likes to play, just like everyone else.”
Mikelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most played matches of the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brings something intangible to the team.
He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s sensual, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy at team meetings.”
“I think the younger players were having fun in the game with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Björn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an incompetent position.
The Dane made his debut at a game in Valderrama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Balesteros had a five-point lead ahead of the Americans, but "crossed the finish line only with their noses", with a minimum lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remind myself that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, when we lost and in Valderrama, when we won for a little bit,” Bjorn, the iconic, said after watching the 2018 class win by 5-3 on Friday and 10 on Friday.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Go get ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play well.
It’s not over as long as the game lasts.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy and the focus stays on it.
I’m always saying, I’m focusing on 12 players in our team, but we’re fully aware of the opposing side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn was pleased with the results of his players on a difficult golf course: "I don't want to give premature ratings on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We’re going to have a different game tomorrow, and that’s a different thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then you test all your skills as a golfer.
That’s the message you have to send to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to give his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furick will require players to play better individually than they played in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furick himself was on both ends of the last day of the change, as he was part of the winning team at Brooklyn before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word there," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought the players together before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
“We’re setting the line appropriately and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of confronting Rory McLroy first and the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the series.
"I decided to play this way with the guys because I think that's how we're going to cover everything," Bjorn said.
The new German warship has been postponed.
The latest German navy frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace outdated Cold War-era warships, but that won't happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rheinland-Faltz, the leading ship of the new class of frigates Baden-Württemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper DiCite, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but problematic issues after delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic track.
Among other important features is less frequent maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from domestic ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that modern warships - which should allow Germany to have power across the oceans - will already be obsolete as they enter service, DiCite notes.
The fateful frigate F125 hit the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blom and Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if it was sent on a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar-class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - also became a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - an increase from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings about Germany's declining naval strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy "is running out of ships that can be deployed."
The official said the problem has worsened over time, as the old ships have been withdrawn from service but no replacement ships have been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new survey of the estate is being conducted in the Scottish mountainous regions in order to discover how bats use the area in search of food.
There is hope that the findings will give answers about the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help lead protection activities in the future.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano bats, as well as the long-eared brown bats and the dubbenton bats at Inverrow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special shooters will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats during the season.
N.E.C. staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert analyses of the sounds from all recordings will determine the frequency depending on the species of bats.
A map of habitats will then be drawn to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, a nature conservation advisor at N.T.E., hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are endangered by construction works and development that affect beds and the loss of habitat.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as do adhesive tapes for flies and some chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Butterflies are not blind.
However, because of their night-time hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of beds, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Triv estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
“Here in Triv we have a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are a lot of unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to thrive.”
He stresses that it is important to check for bats before renovating properties because unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and young, and destroy the entire local population.
Fleas are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Flea Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and our other species, we just don’t know how they live.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape and lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape “fake news,” adding that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman named Katherine Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to keep the incident from happening, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was brought out today is fake news,” said the five-time gold-ball winner in front of his camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they called "an unacceptable transfer of suspicions from private life," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek damages for “moral damage in addition to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident, which is the subject of the allegations, occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "a good boy", but gave up under that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was consent.
Majorga also claims she went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to a bargain without judicial participation because she was afraid of revenge" and was concerned "that she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking a change to the deal because there are injuries from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place and this summer moved to Italian giant Juventus with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain 'will always regret' loss of automakers
Britain will "always regret" losing its status as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota-Britain had announced to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We don’t need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border stalls in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be an end to production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in Britain have expressed concern about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-Am-Wee, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers call the risks of the logistics chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "on-time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break at the border that industry says could cause delays and defects in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely made to avoid such border checks.”
“We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but to seize this opportunity,” he said about today’s BBC Radio 4 program.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned in the long run that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union representative at the factory, said that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman, “We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with deputy public prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, the links between Trump's aides and Russia, and the president's potential violation of the laws.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy public prosecutor and thereby jeopardize Miller’s independence has prompted rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering carrying a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "would not want" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a clash at the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine B.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which would further postpone the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting is not yet determined, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see how things go, and I’m always trying to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders did not hold a briefing for journalists in the White House since September 10.
The driver, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said a small number of briefings were not due to the reluctance to "great influence" on television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president holds more sessions of questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding without providing any evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do that more often, and you’re witnessing that we’ve been doing it consistently over the last few weeks, and conversations with the president of the United States will replace briefings for journalists.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled journalists.
Secretary of Health in a letter to EU workers working in Scotland’s national health system on Brexit-related fears
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers working in Scotland’s national health system expressing the country’s gratitude and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of resolved status applications for EU citizens working in lower-level public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued during the summer, with the aim of making the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of a no-deal deal.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workforce, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and are of benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the defensive player of the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the sideline of the playground and just crashed to the ground,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, then put him in a stretcher and took him for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had recovered from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombie is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red shirt at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made a total of five rematches on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 rematches this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The ministry expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, which will be used to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-earning individuals.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds to strengthen the Government’s efforts to improve the situation of the homeless.
The additional amount that, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London were purchased by non-UK residents, which led to price hikes and made it harder for individuals who first bought property to get involved in this housing purchase process.
Many wealthy areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lower administrative fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction firms of offering high prices on the properties they are holding the land, but did not use it, and asked May to change the quotas for affordable homes in order to remedy the "shameful housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and ending evictions for no justified reason.
He also wants to give the councils greater authority to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime ministership to returning the British dream, namely to make life better for each new generation.
And that means repairing our disrupted housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy homes in the same easy way as valuable British residents.
The dream of owning a home for many people has become too far-fetched, and the humiliation of the homeless is too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "final ambition" was to become the manager of Scotland's national club in the future.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which is currently in third place in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in ‘Hampden’ with my dad and something always pulled me back.
However, I could only get such an opportunity if I was successful in managing the club.”
Some of Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardiche, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Poiet and Paulo Di Caño.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anguish knowing he had to follow such established names in such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success at the moment is assessed by ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get this club there, but I’ll probably think I’ve achieved success here only if I bring the club back there.”
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, a career he entered after working as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from a third-league drop and brought St. Mirren back from the edge of a championship loss the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads for me,” he recalls at the takeover of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, earning enough from it and enjoying certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There are a lot of things to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from the job, but I just feel good in the role of manager.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life.”

According to research, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in profits for British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw sales rise from 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA for business consulting services in determining these figures said: "The sunshine time and longer than England's expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of restaurants increased 2, the percentage of pubs increased.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurants in June worsened even more during July.
Pubs and bars selling mostly beverages saw a much higher increase compared to previous years, unlike restaurants where there was a decline.
The pubs where most food is sold were also badly affected by the sunny periods, though not as dramatic as the owners of restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and food sales by only three percent.
Paul Newman, a vacation and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It’s no surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent over the course of a year will be particularly damaging in addition to the current pressures incurred by the costs.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of the premises where mostly food is sold and the weather will show whether the temperate temperatures we had in August will provide much-needed breathing."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a stalemate in the release of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracker in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of the same 47 operating groups with a combined revenue of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an established benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram profiles.
The news has increased the fear that such profiles are posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” profile that they show their parents
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, creates a social media profile that hides it from adults.
The survey, which included 20,000 high school students, showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta profiles, an abbreviation for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has heightened the fear that such profiles are posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a cleaned “main” profile that they show their parents, and they have other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter on the same encountered a teenager who is asking others to "rape him."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is secret.
HMC boss Mike Buchanan said: “It’s really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected non-executive director of the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most distinguished athlete in Scotland and President Ian Bitty has described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
“Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic community has a huge respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would have a huge benefit if she became a member of the board,” Beety said.
Doyle said: "I am ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really make my contribution and help to properly direct the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200m and 400m titles at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, in addition to winning a total of four gold medals at the Olympics and who now appears regularly as a commentator on BBC, could not walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was tedious, but I managed to fully recover, I can go again and do agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
An advertisement for a breast pump in which mothers were compared to cows caused a division of opinions on the Internet
A company that manufactures breast pumps has sparked dissension on the internet when it published an advertisement in which breastfeeding mothers were compared to begging cows.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be the world’s “most expensive breast pump,” custom-oriented tech company Elvie has released a funny ad inspired by music videos to showcase the freedom the new pump provides to mothers who have arrived.
Four mothers dance in a cow stall full of hay on a song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed these aren't nails, these are my breasts."
The refrain goes on: “Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, grind my breasts.”
However, the ad that was posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlights the dairy industry's "horrors."
“It’s a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except for the fact that their children are stolen from them just a few days after they give birth."
“Elvie” breast pump fits discreetly into breastfeeding bra (“Elvie”/“Mother”)
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “Really inappropriate advertising.”
Others, in turn, defended the ad, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was really "smiling."
“I think this idea is genius.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It’s a brilliant product,” said one of the commentators.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad for mothers who milk (often at their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discrete pumps were pissed in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk grinding pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires, no tubes, and fits discreetly into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even leave the house while milking.
Anna Ballarin, a partner and RDR in Mother, commented: “Elvie’s pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who milk milk and dairy cows, we wanted milk milking with the help of a pump and the challenges that it brings to put the same in the center of attention, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that it brings to the new pump.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has been featured in all titles.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained in detention has increased significantly, although crossings at the monthly level have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unregistered immigrants and were afraid of threatening their own stay in the country if they applied to be a sponsor of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to file fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress last week that the agency had detained dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of the sponsors illegally reside in the country and many of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we continue to chase these individuals," Mr Albens said.
In order to deal with cases with children more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard voted.
Many of them will appear through a video conference call, not in person, in order to bring their legal status case before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit to receive relief will be immediately deported.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to flee, shelter workers and reports emerged from the system in the past few months said.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where due to its size, signs that the child is facing difficulties are more likely to be neglected.
They added that moving children to the tent city, without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, could increase the traumas that most of them already face.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian territory under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be treated appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately and without imposing any conditions," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "lead this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Muallem said the conditions were good for them to return and accused "some of the Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing the issue, which should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the three-million-strong province.
However, Muallem stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who "will be eradicated."
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a subsequent constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Muallem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why will Trump win a second term?
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless his presidential term is interrupted by impeachment and scandal, which most liberals are likely to hope for.
In what will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale in a presidency ever seen!”
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in viewers.
Since 2014, the hit-time rating has more than doubled to reach 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to reach 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Nielsen says Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hit time, up 1.7 million compared to four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news was announced.
“This is like a fire to which people are drawn because this is not something we understand,” said Neil Baer, the main television producer of ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor” for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Skovel, a comedy writer veteran and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys'' Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
“He said, ‘Because I think it’s really funny,’” Mrs. Scowell told me.
There is also a certain fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, and the well-being of the global economy.
The exclusion from all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you're no longer an uninformed citizen when you've been watching a panel of experts for six hours debating the use of a "deep background" source by Bob Woodward for his book Fear, a bomber jacket made of Paul Manafort's leather jacket of $15,000.
I will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
“Part of what he does and what makes you feel like watching a reality show is that every night brings you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Yown Stars for the Trump show’s rotating team.

When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up inside and watching MSNBC while filming on CNN.
He could not stop watching, at least not when Brett Kavanaugh was due to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.

Flux of external funds in the tightest medium-term elections in the race for the Upper House
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of the Congressional Districts from which there are two candidates in the race for the same seat.
For this recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is running Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another area in the emergency elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th congress area, and which largely overlaps with the new 17th congress area.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old areas were being manipulated in favor of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th Congressional District is a tough competition to fund campaigns between major party sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Party's National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after the narrow victory in the emergency election for the 18th Pennsylvania congressional district held in March, which was characterized by wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area by a difference of 20 points.
The Democrats are giving little advantage to the Democrats.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for its support for China, and then gave up.
Diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Dewey's spokeswoman Heather Nauert.
But only in relation to El Salvador, penalties were taken into account, which received U.S. aid of about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and the high unemployment and murder rates there.
As the internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar meeting last year that was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from coming to the US.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials stressed they wanted the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any thinking about punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate that were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations about the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn the history
The next thing that could happen is the release of Special Counsel Robert Miller’s report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently a lot of solid evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before voters, and possibly before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There is a lot of uncertainty here and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable, nor of his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed in that and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now facing a number of such points of change.
What would we do if Mr. Trump resigned deputy prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot seat after the newspaper reported that last year he secretly proposed to shoot the president and speculated that he was inappropriate for the function he was performing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is inaccurate.
“What will we do if Brett Kavanaugh’s new investigation requested by the FBI is incomplete or unjust, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will blame Mr. Trump?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I don’t think that’s going to happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for Saturday on a swastika logo table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorans of the Rangers with an optimistic attitude before the collision with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting a clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and are aware that after a match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians will solidify their position to qualify for the Group.
Graham Dornes, the midfielder due to knee injury was prevented from appearing in the season until the 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to bigger achievements.
"That was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and came back with a score.
Maybe we could have given a little more in the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we gave our best in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday, we have another big European night ahead of us.
I hope that we will win three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good score in the last game, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will return and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a difficult year given everything that happened, namely my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
Women can’t sleep at night because of this fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study, conducted by Nationwide, said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationwide.
This is where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide you with care if you don’t share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you can get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your choices for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash value, which can help you cover costs or secure self-insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Arrange your legal documents: Avoid legal battles right from the start.
Take out a health care proxy so that you can empower a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure health care professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about the power of attorney for your finances.
In this way, you would choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer the questions about the drugs he drinks and his allergies?
Write down these details in writing to get you ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.

Who will take care of the dog?

Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he returned home from leaving.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (British summer time) as an "accidental act."
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police appeal to the witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
Due to the interruption of communications, relief personnel are unable to obtain information from Donglala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake's 7.5-degree epicenter.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) off the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia’s disaster relief agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the Dongala.
The tsunami also hit western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck an area near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hits one of Mentawaj islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focused earthquake struck Pidi Jaya County in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report of domestic violence, and opposition to arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the Mat-Su detention facility with the option to leave if he pays $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he was being tried, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A violations, meaning he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a B-Class violation, sentenced to one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaska Veteran's Court is pending.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in the crime report of domestic violence, and possession of alcohol-induced weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her on the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son's violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck an area near Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On social media, videos showing the moment of the hit are circulated.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of New York Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck in October to attack a bicycle lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and overtake pedestrians and cyclists found in his path.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a report on the intent to seek the death penalty filed in New York’s Southern District.
According to the court documents, it is possible to pronounce the death penalty on both these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury filed 22 charges against Saipov, including eight murder charges for racketeering purposes, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "detailed planning and deliberation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov executed it as "terrible, cruel and perverted."
"Saifulo Habibulaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused, injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, En-Laure Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij for Hernan Ferruccio, Herna Ferrucci
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since a case of the death penalty was prosecuted in New York’s Southern District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death with an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the allegations, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
Police also said he had asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt and serving a life sentence without a release option, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage, during a protest at the Tory party conference, said he would "mobilize the people's army".
Former UKIP leader said politicians must "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's MPs proposing that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn on the Birmingham march said the UK would have been "out of the EU" so far if Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Ms May faces in terms of uniting her deeply divided members was stressed by counter-Brexit members of the Tory party who joined a separate protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue the implementation of the plan by the Chekers despite the attacks by pro-Brexit, counter-Brexit and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that she would force Eurosceptics and Labour members to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Bonn told a pro-Brexit meeting in Solihull that he wanted to "reject the plan from the Chequers."
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge of the negotiations, so far we would have been outside the EU,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the plan from the Chequers."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars for now to be submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Bonn rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely inaccurate.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and pro-Brexit party, was also present at the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not well-accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well-accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and to whom our election victory is due.
“Please give up the plan from the Checkers and start listening to us.”
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians must “feel the heat” if they intend to hand over the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the brink of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has enabled us to win Brexit and that will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, counter-Brexit parties marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists appeared this weekend carrying banners with the inscription "Tories vs. Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked the Conservatives on the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference regarding the application created by the party.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can establish IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for borders without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning to think about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "reflect well on running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future during a city council meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event in Hollywood on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump took office, which was held in a city hall format.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was “time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top.”
The suspect in the case of the shooting and death of basketball player Simms from the "LSU" team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Simms of the LSU team that took place on Friday was arrested.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11 p.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man from the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms had a gunshot wound to the head and as a result died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the crime scene, possessing a gun, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Button Rose Parish Police Department.
As a 192-centimeter junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 appearances last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton closer to world title after the team secured his victory over Sebastian Vettel with his orders
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the half-position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the loose as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxing first and left Hamilton to fight the interference at the end of the group, something that should have had a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing one lap later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the one-on-one action that inadvertently forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior at his own risk to stay aside after the double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round finished in seventh place.
He then led the majority of the race and steered the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and surpass Kimi Raikkonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered boxing in the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen came in fourth.
“Today is a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team made a truly exceptional decision to have their own pair in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Finnstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she had not published a letter from Christine Blasi Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not look directly at Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "ugly and ugly and dishonest."
“There’s only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what’s happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and evil and reckless and dishonest,” he said.
“When you see posts and leaks of information and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you publish this information?
Do you remember her response... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish it... No, we didn’t publish it,” he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein with information regarding Ford's allegations against Cavanaugh in July, and the same was published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep them confidential, and I did what she asked.”
But the president doesn’t seem to believe her denial, so she commented on the same thing at the rally on Saturday: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested Democrats are using allegations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to regain power in any way.
“You can see their wickedness, their wickedness, they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they’re going to have to trample down to regain their power and control,” he said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars offset the loss of the Elite League match on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 draw in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took advantage of two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Frances Bouvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney scored an advantage for the host over Dwyer to return the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third loss of the season within the Elite League for Adam Keefe's boys, who returned with a 2–1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth match between the two sides in the season, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFall, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bovillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan secured the host's lead with 13:10, before Matt Merkart assisted Cooney to score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard again brought them back with a powerful game and goal, with the result being 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen for the first time secure Dundee's lead in the match late in the second half and he secured his team's victory in half of the final period of the fifth match.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Flight controller dies after helping hundreds of people on board a plane to escape from earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong successive quakes continue to ravage the area, and many are stuck in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave the position at the control tower at Mutiara Sis al-Jaffrey Airport in Palu, which was continually hovering.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's flight number 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was coming down.
He later died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision was likely to save hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
“This news has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of casualties is increasing as many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot even be reached," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
The quarries that reached up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances carry bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are robbed everywhere.”
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and sent a message to the national army: “I call on all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Previous articleMicronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man disappeared after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man has disappeared after previously declaring that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they could not find the male passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low.
"It's a very good thing," Janes said.
Janes said he and the others managed to pass through the water that reached them to half and headed to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers working near the harbour reconstruction also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the aviation safety network shows that 111 people died in accidents of airlines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini.
Analyst establishes time frame for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded by presenting the case on Saturday for the re-trial of the man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He pointed out to the jury that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlet said he had obtained location data from several cell phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he stated he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis erased messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from her phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
“The High Breed: What is conscientious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to refute the negative attitude to this genre by incorporating positive messages into their music.
Bristol's "The High Breed" claims that hip-hop has distanced itself from its origins as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and re-popularize conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black woman?!
A New York babysitter sues a married couple for being fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York babysitter sues a married couple for being fired on the basis of discrimination after mistakenly receiving a message from a mother complaining that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new caregiver Giselle Morris found out that she was a black woman.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE A ONE BLACK," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, Post, feeling "uncomfortable" she fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an African-American, was doing the job poorly and that instead of her, "the nanny was expecting the nanny to be gone."
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first working day and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now sues the couple and seeks damages for the $350-a-day dismissal over a six-month period, a commitment that would involve her living with the family, which she was originally committed to, but without entering into a deal.
“I want to show them that such things should not be done,” she told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations that they were racist, saying that dismissing Mrs. Morris was a reasonable procedure because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person you have been rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Claiming the lawsuit to be "extortion," Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to attack someone who is in such a situation?
That’s not very good,” added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public immediately condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won't be able to connect with a talking bear, the new letter reveals.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book’s acceptance, said of the letter: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired to write the book from a small toy in the shape of a bear, would still be optimistic if his work was not well received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was his "bitter and sweeter" year.
For Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
“He was a really quiet man and he didn’t want to brag at all,” she said.
But because he felt Paddington so real, it was almost like having a child who achieved something in life: and you’re proud of him even though success isn’t due to yourself.
“I think Paddington’s success was perceived that way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad and that he was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping was slowly decreasing and they were coming out of her system.
She died early, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
“I really had to stay awake.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I bowed my head and the tears didn’t stop.
It’s hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt immense sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Women lay cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide make an effort to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as an infectious smile.
“Everyone remembers him with his smile.
People have always said that his smile can illuminate any room.”
However, he gave up his job before he died because it was “in a really dark place.”
His 11-year-old brother was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid that it will have a consistent effect.”
Ms. Davis is making the cards “to let others know that there are people out there who they can talk to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to start talking.”
Mrs. Humphries, who is Mrs. Davis's longtime friend, lost her partner Mark with whom she was married 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt unhappy or depressed, that is, he didn’t say anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas Day when the children opened their gifts, and he didn’t look them in the eye and make any contact with them.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for all of them, but they had to find a way to get through it: “That kind of thing is ruining the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we have to keep going and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain since the FBI began the investigation.
"I thought if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, namely a limited-time, limited-range investigation, maybe we could achieve a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "disintegrate" in the face of a rootless party.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is due only to timing.
The midterm elections should be held in just a few weeks, i.e. on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could win at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to change the unresolved outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has "reduced" under the leadership of Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Bjeong-seung, citing data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, said there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Park said tight border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees have been granted citizenship in South Korea over time.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be crossed more easily compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss issues that focused on the stalemate of denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday accused the U.S.-imposed sanctions of stagnating progress since then.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that if his temperament is taken into account he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted in this way, they would say she was 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasi Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his introductory presentation, sometimes even screaming and lamenting as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation” organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is evidence that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has been shown to be biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh if the allegations against him were confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then not only is he not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to serve in the court where he is currently in office," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about the possible verdicts Kavanaugh would make against the Accessible Health Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered to be subject to conservative justice.
In the hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to go to court and expect us to say, ‘That’s really beautiful, isn’t it,’” Pelosi said.
Women should also use it.
It’s a really sharp criticism, months and years of accumulating anger, which she can’t get rid of without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, right?”
She went on to say, “I was very much helped by a woman who was performing an executive function somewhere, and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her own technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And then she continues to cry.
I think that’s genius.”
Tears are allowed as an exhaled valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in an office that was dominated by men was when I once started crying with inexpressible anger and an older woman, a cold manager I always had a certain fear of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll enjoy the fact that they managed to reach you.”
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me 30 years later with a laugh.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given the fact that the campaign was launched a long time ago, she did not have enough financial resources, so she promised that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, would only give her $250.
“Do they think there should be a discount for me?” she asked.
During her speech announcing that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, i.e. gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates and sex.
“If you had seen me, you would have probably thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to the incident.
“You would have thought that Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember asking what they were going to write on my grave plate.
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of fire at the start of the U.S.-China trade war was daunting, and even though the battle is far from over, the clash between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave his first warning earlier this year by paying tribute to key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly this week with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Each time, Beijing returned in kind, i.e. recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to give back to the United States with equal measure, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will give up the same in the near future.
To force Washington to withdraw means to accept his demands, but public worship before the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could result in positive support for China in the long run as it will reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for the onset of a sharp decline from an economic point of view in any of the countries is much more dangerous than was previously determined by the observers," said Abigail Grays, a senior U.S. official.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by a long war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had an impact on their daily lives are now provided.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Mulayem said the Syrian regime welcomed aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team defeated the U.S. team in the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 vs. 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive European titles and has not won a Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the primacy after Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, pointed the ball in the water in a pair of 3s to the 16th hole, losing it to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all rounds, becoming one of four players to score 5-0-0 after starting to organize the tournament in the current format in 1979.
Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the European team's lowest-ranked player, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the highest-ranked player in the world, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most tournament titles with 25.5 points in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stop.
This year has been really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I am very happy to have returned the title.
Team play is the most important thing and I'm happy to have been able to help," Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He is now relegating his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday defeated one-on-one Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with a score of 2-1.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," Ram said.
Woods lost in all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking after Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to direct the game to the low-grass fields, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick said after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning, we had a tough time with the team.
We fought.
Cap down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Association of Professional Golfers of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit to them.
We were overwhelmed.
