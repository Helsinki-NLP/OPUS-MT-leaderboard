Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, as measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, said the European Community's statistics office located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the guiding interest rate by saying that falling interest rates, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it’s Catch 22 for the ECB: inflation “must be deterred” in order not to have to intervene on this subject at a later date.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The futures market for cereals has increased by 88 percent and the price of soybeans has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the global price of oil rose by 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1, this year, to 2.5 percent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, in the next 3 to 4 months, the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the policy rate twice in 2008.
Gallup warns of government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December, thus since 2002, it has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institute of Polling) has never seen such low socialist support, i.e. 13 percent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
On loyal voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the economic situation of the country to be particularly serious has never been so high, it rises to 41 percent and according to 46 percent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook for spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects an aggravation and only one tenth expects an improvement.
Last December, 71 percent of the people surveyed, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, judged that the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of the respondents have confidence or much confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in political situation is the proportion of society that thinks that discontent with the Prime Minister can be treated without a change in government.
While after the October riots, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of intention to vote, 60 percent of the respondents answered that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 percent said that they would probably vote.
To make a comparison, for a "organize legislative election next Sunday", only 55 percent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to enrolment in higher education, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look only at the same proportion of those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees, respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has raised its prices by nearly twenty percent
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs commercial triangle have maintained the average price increase of 16 percent over the past year, with the difference that this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economics)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 percent on average, an increase in value of well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which “already flew off” in major grocery stores last December, no longer rose sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nonetheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased significantly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, that figure was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but prices for turkey, walnut and poppy nets have risen sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to only 139 forints.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the recorded two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the recorded bottle included.
It only prevents this year, in terms of daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent, respectively.
By comparing last year’s most expensive basket and this year’s least expensive basket, we see a 12 percent difference while the difference between last year’s least expensive and this year’s most expensive is 21 percent.
Prices rose by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of <0xC2><0xA3>1,206, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has puzzled trade, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply on products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin appropriate to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the price increase of the Daily Cart has evolved so excessively that the most expensive cart was 1,720 forints higher than the value of 2006 while the difference between the cheapest carts was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the prices of the cheapest increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By bringing the two Christmas seasons closer together, we saw a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some essential foods, the Statistical Institute noted a price increase of more than 30 percent over 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the latter's Daily Cart, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already quite expensive last year, increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, suppliers of flour occupy a stronger position than suppliers of eggs because they have managed to make accepting the sudden increase in prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
In our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets they visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-term storage foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important queues formed at the cash registers of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to the survey companies not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption items.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overload of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatology department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident left the hospital, but shortly thereafter he had to return because of an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have been unable to perform a major operation because of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National System of Nosocomial Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Namely, it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One-third of people carry the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without it developing a disease.
SA-caused infections (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a highly resistant bacterium that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicemia, on elderly, lightweight or having a weakened organism.
According to the director of the hospital János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily routine of hospitals.
Especially not to confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only there or we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the caregivers are wearing rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however infection cannot always be prevented.
Sample sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favorable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is most common in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases only show up if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the doctor in charge of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, in other words, microbiological tests should be performed to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, wear gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by inhaled droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the sick should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government Project Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness
The official statement regarding the fatal accident caused by the 22nd District Commissioner has been made.
It can be ruled out that the 22nd district commissioner, who has since resigned from his post, who crushed a pedestrian causing his death on Tuesday, would have driven drunk or stunned, Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the capital's public ministry, said on Friday after the statement was made.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement police station crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself facing him when he turned, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos street of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(Furthermore, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not an mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code, a car that starts a corner must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and asked for his retirement because, according to the police report, the accident greatly upset him.
The investigation into this case is conducted by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
An additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed on Friday in Budapest three agreements worth a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, of which a loan contract worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million can be used later, following the extension of the loan contract.
The parties have signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the subway line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss the possible modification of the original contract when Hungary has finalised the details of the financing of the subway with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment fees.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this little-cited Balkan country in the past.
What, or who bought on this EU market that is always the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most fashionable destination in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the old Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the area of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also increasing in numbers to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, the areas of shops and offices promise the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time looking to change their life, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present. On the Black Sea shore and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet a lot of Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to move in buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old decayed houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium or long-term surplus value.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly rising due to an increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there are lively discussions on this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, at the moment, it did not want to discuss exact figures, however, it was prepared to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another important topic at the conference is whether developed countries are committed, apart from emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of directors composed of 16 members likely within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said in a statement.
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as a flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing capacity by 2020 its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the “post-2012 Agreement”, and it was ready to reduce them by up to 30 percent if other major regions of the world and/or their developing countries were also committed to taking responsibility.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signatories to the Kyoto Protocol had aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all of the 15 EU members of that time made the commitment by 8 per cent less.
Hungary has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the level between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the new long-term international agreement on climate policy must be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by the change in the international system.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
British military units are communicating on the video-sharing site recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that became passionate about YouTube: special units intervening in Afghanistan uploaded video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London where compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable.
The air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this path and their "chain" was watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The U.K. Department of Defense signed up as "defence headquarters" in the spring of 2007 and is communicating videos about operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were posted online to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they were also used to make the real objectives of the army's presence abroad known to the general public.
The propaganda published through this channel costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, as reported to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defense consultant, but it also inevitably conveys a political message since it justifies in a special form the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been passed on the sharing site that also feature, for example, the death of soldiers: in "official" propaganda films, somewhat hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side.
In fact, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out in real mission, but the British military has only recently packed up for loading these videos.
The Americans do the recruiting a little differently by using the free downloadable America's Army shooting game. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas lottery and donuts in ministries
Labour minister Mónica Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her co-workers who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a lottery and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is fun.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense, but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry is planning a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
Compared to other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a lottery.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and a dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, a bidding management company.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for this purpose.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to contact the person responsible.
The costume is not compulsory
The ILO building was home not only to the NFÜ but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of St. Luke on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
The ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the minister’s welcome words and dinner was followed by a dance party on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening outfit was not at all compulsory at this ball.
The ministries of health, labor and local authorities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and eat donuts, the press service said, the party will not cost as well as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his employees to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas party in its large hall at which 436 employees are expected.
It expects to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the presentation of the minister but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, Christmas will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only accredited foreign diplomats in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, held annually, begin with a few welcome words from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services reported to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are coming together
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form, on Friday, their strike committee, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams as the railway traffic will be stopped almost completely and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1pm.
The League’s trade unions will announce on Friday afternoon the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers’ Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike commission will also be formed, it will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protesters will be held and, starting Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop working for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Funds Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Funds Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what to do next.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the Health Funds Act will take place only late in the evening, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are planned: the railways will stop working for an indefinite period and during the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different parts of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, and the list of them is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report an indefinite strike, while others have declared a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon, the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Railways (VDSZSZ) were unable to find an agreement on minimum services, and as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 13h, Budapest airport between 7h and 9h of the morning, the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike at four hours, the Union of Teachers at 8 hours and the Union of Democracy at 2 hours.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternatingly, the Health and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ) affiliated with the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee in respect of retirement before the legal age, which would allow for the transfer into the system of the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railways (VDSZSZ), affiliated to the League Trade Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding the secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August with the support of the Magyarországért Mozgalom Jobbik (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company notes that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of the Hungarian political actors: “the public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Roma and the Hungarians.”
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of increased attention from the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following increased publicity given to the reorganization of the radical and far-right Hungarian groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves "national self-defense association".
"The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their members for defense missions (disasters, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, in addition, evoking the incompetence of the police, the army, said another.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method which, based on the resentment of the society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil character and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal traps of registering these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk, and ultranationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many disturbances of Roma that erupted in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to establish a guard by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
According to them, over the past 17 years, the gypsies have “terrified” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the constitution of their own guard as resistance signals an increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of information from the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law precisely defines the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as holidays.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also rest days, the latter all the more so that the awakeners can rest quietly.
In one year, we have eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as is October 23, which is the day of commemoration of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is the holiday of labor and on November 1 and 2, we remember the members of our family and friends who have died.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday preceding the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and all their employees, public servants and people working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions that operate uninterruptedly and in service, because of their vocation, and also to days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to experiences, the majority of people rather make overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganised for the first time around the Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home for four consecutive days.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a day off on Friday 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can terribly annoy colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: these are things that “embellish” the everyday life of a workplace.
The question is whether to get used to these troubles or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called by the marketing department,” a colleague tells you.
That you missed an appointment?
At best, he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, it is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it’s helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make an effort to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Do you remember the other day you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they are right to be angry with you for having pissed off their property.
Do not bring envelopes back, post it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and you need them right away.
Are you talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop the spread of gossip.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (assumptions) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information in yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in its absence, even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you claiming to be sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a tearful headache because you feel sick or feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your future missions must be performed by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won’t go to work or that something might happen that would force you to stay at home, don’t forget to warn your boss and colleagues to avoid them being surprised by your absence the next day.
Redundancy, enrichment, telephone
You're getting into your work, but your colleagues' bribery is suddenly ripping you off?
Have you witnessed a conversation over the phone that you would have rather not listened to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with sneering, chanting, loud conversations (which you lead over their heads), beatings, big words, or expressed discontent aloud.
They can bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a mistake?
If your work is not done by the deadline, you forget to send an important mail or message, do not blame anyone for this forgetting!
Don’t put it on the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has presented inconveniences for others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel at home at the office?
Putting on a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Don’t put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to live up to your expectations, you're no longer interesting.
Slowly move in the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm making the sound.
The music changes pace and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of the whole time, then a female choir joins it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The Hungarian music life did not spoil us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground begin to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of the garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came from Pécs and he himself played in the Yonderboi group before he started on his own track, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an ally of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The formation playing at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would be equally competitive in the west.
Zagar and his band have undoubtedly become “trendful” but no one has asked them if they would like to wear this label.
The band reacted well, he released a new and better record.
The recently released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new tracks for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Pécs by Balázs Zságer.
We are well there with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, rock and roll impact.
György Ligeti, singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the debut of the album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began introducing the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music for a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
As alternatives, underground music can also be mediocre and made solely to sell and thus become commercial.
A good pop song can be honest too.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people of about ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts or the mutual influence already works, but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I've noticed that if you want to meet the expectations of the audience, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and made careers rather in the west.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some people try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, it was inevitable that our music was compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his band and take a different path.
hvg.hu: On mr2 Petõfi’s palmarès, Wings of Love ranks first.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style, have you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t plan to make a tube to sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
So the six-member choir was composed, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This track had been around for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we wrote the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The sequence of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I even sang the melody the girls learned later in the night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert too it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a solo role, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their song.
They were also behind the scenes.
Is it wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget a little bit our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: To tell the truth, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What’s your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “left” this record.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The Perfidious Trader Risked Billions Due to His Inferiority Complex
A concealing fraudster.
Thus, his former employee is the French giant Société générale, owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, moreover, can by no means be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the U.S. mortgage market crisis in time.
"He's fragile," his superiors said, who reported him to the police.
However, following Kerviel's statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the man's transactions produced at the end of last year a profit of 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis surpasses the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the U.S. crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called “sub-prime” mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he made a good bet.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, adding that he had, of course, nothing left for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses to having misrepresented the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to trick his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his trades.
Who does not risk anything has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
I don't think so.
"I estimated that the mere fact of having gotten 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to risk so much come from?
He came to his position only gradually.
He began working for the Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my academic background and my professional and personal career,” Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after taking office, he achieved his first major success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title in the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
Now, that is when the blow of the beginning of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion due to him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious because of his vacation.
“Last year I only took 4 days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to someone else,” Kerviel concludes.
Czech Republic to receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly CZK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to earn around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage next year an amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme, intended for SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Businesses should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more effective management methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
The Tribunal has confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of the country Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and residing in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, either they will let German finish his sentence at home, or he will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Aleman regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious societies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Some of that money went to the funds that Aleman had created to fund his 2001 election campaign.
The budget has been adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
This one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the hectic debate before the vote on the government’s declaration of mistrust, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives has passed this law without any problems, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a sort of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and the end of every government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more media-attractive and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
Politicians’ disputes are much more of interest to opinion than steep figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not able to solve at the same time:
The first is the significant share of the mandate costs imposed by law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" grouping the parties <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, that is, the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest chance.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real bomb of delay is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds, over-indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain new sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits.
In recent years, they have been able to repay these debts through the mass sale of shares in distribution systems, including those of energy, obtained from the state in the context of privatizations.
Nowadays, they no longer have this source.
If it is based solely on official and verifiable facts, it can be seen that:
Our economy has already been going through a phase of growth for several years, just like the rest of the world, and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not miss out.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were indebted to the state more and more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have handled their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous disgrace that mainly falls on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes which have, unfortunately, been unnecessarily inflated in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, has been removed, if a shift in the retirement age limit, as well as a reform of the pension system, will not take place any time soon, then any policy will cease to exist only in this country and whoever will be in power, he will do so.
To exaggerate, it can hardly be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary expenses to be pushed back by mandate expenses.
The $70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile governmental coalition, aware that the state can spend only the equivalent of what it manages to collect in taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will be able to gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Solve the Crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together the crisis of the financial markets.
More than a hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on the monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will auction $40 billion and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the 9/11 attacks that individual central banks have decided to take concerted action to prevent, or even mitigate, the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes in its report to clients Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"Central banks' concerted action has reduced the likelihood of a U.S. recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl said in a report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still expecting billions of more losses.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they must really grasp what can still follow," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It sounds like the situation is really bad,” he adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks made this choice after failing to bring down London's interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, even though the U.S., Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly reduced their interest rates during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Tempus Consulting's Greg Salvaggio told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank’s approach will help to evoke the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
President Klaus: Environmentalists’ debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be particularly damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has come down this time on the UN International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not the Green Planet, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, substituting solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, at the presentation of his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed satisfaction that his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions."
From now on, interested people can read his positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is not an opinion shared by all the researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they represent the costs of the climate in order to avoid any danger, they are therefore dangerous and influenza.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unchecked opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integralist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profits they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people have failed to renew their driver's license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have let the deadline expire and have failed to renew their old driver's license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of unlicensed drivers will take the road.
According to the authorities, they did not renew their driver's license, especially those who do not want to drive anymore.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has been increasing this week.
The City Council satisfies about 2,000 customers per day.
There's a half-hour queue.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driver's licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request delivery within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to renew their driving licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid licence will face a fine as early as January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the policeman can also deal with the offence using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to restrain and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in the tens of thousands.
According to him, the driver's license is a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not like with the ID card which, it, must be valid without exception.
Those who no longer wish to drive should return their driver's license.
All you need to do is bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to renew.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the sentences of detectives pacted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych’s gang, will face thirteen and ten years in prison respectively.
The High Court of Prague thus definitively sentenced them by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, the detectives of the Department for Combating Organized Crime were at risk of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment given today, only an appeal to the Superior Court is envisaged.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting the verdict of first instance.
However, he has already received in other trials sentences of more than 16 years in prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court found 19 people guilty of participating in hold-ups, and the Superior Court today dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have, since the beginning of the investigation, challenged the accusation by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement, among other things, with Berdych, passed information to criminals from police sources, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
In return, the gang handed over 30 percent of the larcin to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The prosecution refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies, the victims of which have, in most cases, suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weapons.
During house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a sight for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the allegations, the gang has enriched themselves with tens of millions of crowns.
Aside from nearly 20 men in the trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a whole host of other people guilty of other high-handed robberies.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing avoided, for the time being, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who currently live in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision regarding their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer for the injured families, Igor Veleba, wants to obtain from the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital a compensation of 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál Hospital absolutely disagrees with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject such a claim, which is very, very high," Dostál said at the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report of which the opposing party ordered the drafting.
We will check if this has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov's family asked for a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subjected to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they were faced with remorse for not having been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at <0xC4><0x8C>ermák in Przybyslavice and Veronika at Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina region, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, gave each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to have liability insurance.
In case of default, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
So far, the courts have recognized relatively low compensation, with the amounts calculated from the tables being in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Soup and loss of the Kingdom of Wallachia (le Royaume de Wallachia)
Bolek Polívka a perd le litige au sujet de la marque Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské krajství (Royaume de Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské).
According to the judge of the Regional Court of Ostrava, it was indeed he who had used the title King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, former collaborator of the actor.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
Now, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing about the popularity of Bolek Polivka," Polivka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“There’s a nearly 10-year job behind us.
Searching for money and setting up events," he said.
According to him, it is the money that is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> král (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> crowned him king in 1993.
However, at the time, this had nothing to do with the plan to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of making Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Království passports appear.
From a humorous action originally came a lucrative business and business activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království.
In 1997, Polívka accepted that his name and signature should be mentioned in the passport and even offered the holders balances on the price of the visit to his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the nude idea, published by Polívka in the mané<0xC5><0xBE> show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the project Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské krávství," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was formed by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense way.
Collaboration between the now-enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated with the deposition of "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, demanding that the court today dismissed it.
What could clear the case is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
There should be a new king.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
“We don’t want to go fast and try.
It would be something like the parade of the kings in Slovacko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Polivka can, of course, register," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its bearing qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change in speed, of the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many respects, be classified as inferior to the average.
Its successor is the Peugeot 207, which is much better.
The more the combi named SW goes one step further, I just have to think about it.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the headroom in the rear seats.
While there ends the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the big devils will be, in this respect, comfortable.
Let's see it done quickly
I am going to talk about the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about too short seats or backrests is over.
The lateral guidance has also been significantly improved compared to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is also noticeable here.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A trunk in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to rate this as very accessible (also thanks to the rear rotating ice) and a rather easy cramping.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold fairly heavy objects.
Let’s stop at the volume.
This does, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure in relation to the competition.
Apart from the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav’s product, we find that Peugeot remains very significantly behind, with the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the box left after the backrests of the rear seats were overturned perfectly straight, or a very low footrest.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that’s what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback work.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust jar blocked by a hopper, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by everyone.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine rising to 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still reasonable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
That's a lot, but try adding extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you'll get a very similar figure.
All you have to do is choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is failing
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concerns among the rest of the population about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans faces, for the moment, a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of natives turn into violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where the remaining conflicts between Slovak immigrants and immigrants are beginning to escalate, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, harassment and quarrels between students have transposed into relationships between parents.
The situation has gone so far that police have arrested in Chatham a Slovak woman who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The accused defended herself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“When we got home, a young man climbed the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks,” another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors went so far as to classify conflicts with immigrants as fighting for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can come true if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
Now, there is only one island on which you will find much more and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
By the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the stronghold of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and transshipment place of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was erected at the very beginning of the 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who made it build, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under the prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, buildings in height grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the bar of the National Hotel, a luxury hotel, we will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the once imported jigulis and fiats have long since rotten, in such a salty and humid climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is substantially degraded, nowhere else in the surrounding area are there as splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the plantations extended into the candy stores on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how small locomotives can be seen on the road, whose contemporary locomotives are only in museums elsewhere.
Where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that those who love this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks candlelight up from the bottom of the valley, and, with fertile soil grasping in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is probably the place where the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad and Tobago
Ancient town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the market, the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought it glory and wealth.
The wealth embodied in the beauty and the city-window character of this small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountainous Escambray, is a place so far apart that even in the 1950s there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stand aside.
We weren’t building anything, and that’s why we weren’t demolishing anything, everyone was just having a roof over their heads.
If you have, in Trinidad, more time than an afternoon, then it is also worth going to see interesting places in the surroundings, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Candy Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which is animated after sunset and where the music is deaf only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and pass through a landscape almost unmarked by human activity.
UNESCO has included the East of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the trip of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle-fort and the current hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountainous massif, the Bay of Pigs and the Island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves could re a lot, about all this
But, as they say, it’s better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, the Americans say.
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should be, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
Alongside the growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called NATO troops for more activity, Britain sees strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and intensifying development aid as a priority.
“Evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow residents to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," Defence Secretary Des Browne told BBC.
Eighty-nine percent
Afghan insurgent activity is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
Now, according to the United States, the Allies have reached their absolute limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is Passive
In recent months, conflicts have also reigned among the countries involved in the issue of whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as rigorous as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan fainties discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went back to counterattack by publishing a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is borne by each Czech.
The total debt at the end of September was 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Due to a better-than-expected change in state budget savings, the ministry reduced the projected amount to CZK 152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, as of June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on government debt from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 kronor is borne by each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has indebted more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could exceed the limit of a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor’s forecast is similar: “We could exceed the trillion in 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget, which is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The debt of the State is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is generated mainly by the accumulation of the deficits of the State budget.
State debt is financed by treasury bonds, rent securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has so far increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor.
The foreign debt of the state has increased this year from 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called negotiable state debt reached 803.3 billion kronor at the end of September and as of June it decreased by 13.7 billion kronor.
The average debt receivability of the State was 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased year-on-year from the first to the third semester by 13 percent, which, given the current good health of the economy, is far too high.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by rent securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt increases, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be material to negotiate when pension reform comes," Pikora said.
Better Than Expected
This follows the 2007 government debt financing and management strategy, which the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected change in the state budget savings, the ministry reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit of the state budget, which is clearly going to reach 76 billion kronor this year, instead of the originally planned 91.3 billion kronor.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. 13.3 billion kroner, the 10 billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state annuity securities for 43 billion kroner and the repayment of the loans of the European Investment Bank in the amount of 1 billion kroner.8
She was appearing before a court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting pupils ages 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punishable by a whiplash.
This 54-year-old British teacher working at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her pupils, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not carry any label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the prophet's representation considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never do anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said.
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the Prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This, of course, is a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final session of talks Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was “at stake,” his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honor their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“There is no immediate anticipation of violence, but we are entering a very difficult period,” he said, adding that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The province’s 90 percent Albanian-speaking future could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council's granting of independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A declaration of unilateral independence? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina says she is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in her favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu said in the hotel in Baden, where the last-chance negotiations have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, a former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade says it fears a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that “the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made “in consultation” with Westerners.
Bush pulls out Israeli-Palestinian deal
President George W. Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he attended Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised he would do anything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides to their obligations under the “roadmap” for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim “to conclude a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, without exception, including the central issues.”
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven out of their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and address all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and ongoing" and "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set a deadline for the implementation of his "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli states" that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview with the Arab-speaking daily Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
So what exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this kind of various fact, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police General Inspection (IGPN) investigation, a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not in intervention but in patrol, and was traveling at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophare,” a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, therefore not allowed to travel on public roads" (see below) and driven by two helmetless youngsters, was circulating "at a very vivid pace".
“She hit the police car on her left after a priority refusal on the right,” a police officer said.
The alcohol control exercised on the occupants of the vehicle proved negative.
The condition of the car (front slammed, star-studded windshield, ripped bumper) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, cosy with the departmental direction of public safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation at this stage dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footstools on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled while the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the premises very quickly, thus not providing help to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious error" in this regard.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we must be very careful," a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows overlooks the stage.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them," the witness said.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a policeman completely haggard, who was drunk.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youth, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that swiftly surrounded the scene, and apparently with the certainty that the people present had had the unexpected situation of the youth, the policemen were driven by colleagues who arrived on the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived “about twenty minutes after the police departed”.
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
“I will not say that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were wounded by tear-gas shells used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or policemen charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court bar lawyers called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests were reported to have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday gathered support from religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "exhorted the population to send flowers to judges who have spoken out against the state of emergency and debris to those who have taken oath before Musharra'.
“Musharraf’s promise is no longer true.”
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned by the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday night.
In the next few days, she was due to vote on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in the presidential election on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
“Everything we see is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the judge told The News.
The promise of Pervez Musharraf to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "no longer holds" after the state of emergency was instituted, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf was placed under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed for better "fertility control," according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Voor calculated on the nearest month for a couple out of five and if possible in the spring, season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, indispensable to the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was conceived, tools “bricoled” by astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday as astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical piece tasked with hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for lab modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17.5-tonne solar panel power generation module, already present on the ISS, in order to position it at its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the module's solar panels, which have a span of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged over nearly a meter by a cable that stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a check-out of the Discovery shuttle and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snail at the end of the 30 meters long remotely controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers on the planet.
Large, resistant, very clever, he has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, the training doctor was tasked with “operating” the “wounded” solar panel.
After accurately inspecting the damage, he cut the faulty cable and installed some sort of "splits" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who stayed close to the sas and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped with insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and “bricoled” by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making an inventory of his tools and getting back inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were enjoying a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
EADS shares are currently falling sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced it would have to spend between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion to cope with A400M delays.
EADS is currently losing 4% at 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating result forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow progression in the development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to mitigate the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", said the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income (EBIT) targets for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further figuring out.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS’s operating profit fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to the delays of another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French military in October 2009.
Choosing the Status Quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, on the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked-down campaign.
Three days before the election, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a televised message to voters on public channels, which is already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list of united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proclaims itself overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let any of it transpire by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, free elections,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from accountable.
It denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there have never been “such dirty elections, even in Yeltsin’s time.”
After the crackdown on the protests last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains barred from visiting, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the soviet homo”
Behind these unbroken legislations are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot contest a third consecutive term.
No successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The head of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
Either way, in both the legislative and the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet homo, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society has taken a step back in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin reconnected with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease,” says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “willfully renounce personal responsibility” which they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
“What is good to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) head the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: “What is good to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archive documents, stored on 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only accessible for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or its beneficiaries.
The eleven States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States having been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will lead to research “including on the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced labour,” says Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as presumed homosexuality or the mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, to provide proof of their detention, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin, said in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are hoping to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The EU's foreign ministers gave their green light last April to the European Commission to enter into negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s ninth trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact would greatly affect both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by the European Union, said the European Commissioner.The European and Asian giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week the European Commission and the head of the delegation of New Delhi.

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was concerned to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that the common financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserves in a five-year maintenance period starting on 6 December."
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time the BoE seems to be putting five-week cash on the market in an open market operation.
These are usually done within a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain interest rates" on day-to-day interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The interbank rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a high penalty rate that had discouraged banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC Refuse to Review PS Purchasing Power Proposals
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text outlined a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including a 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the management of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was lifted at the end of the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his group will represent the entirety of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is expected to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he's ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style event festival.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
“Unfortunately, we got caught up in the politics of the current administration,” continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we have been able to talk to Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours rather takes place in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a country festival to the European and urban to the American.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastic about holding this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims "that they are interesting enough to allow us to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s capacity is “very large,” similar to that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations to the groups had been issued, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of press release.
“Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied there, in the hopes of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie sets in Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of a delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the Governor?
“We have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best," he said.
The Race to Festivals
At the moment, however, Denis Turcotte’s priority is the promotion of film from here.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be a matter of all the festivals on the West Side, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present the Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that the directors make interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year the experts are not so sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made exclusively based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties lie in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum during the last few weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of the long quality periods in the values".
For this, they believe the stock market will be rather lateral, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
“It’s not the best thing,” the expert said.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to retirement plans that occur every year during those dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a bit different this year as he believes the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution Day (December 6th).
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be caused based on the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex towards new maximum ratings.
Intermoney’s Solana says “this year the great values are back for him.”
The expert would include the two major banks and a few builders in the portfolio "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, says the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get involved.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that tech companies will do as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
In the past seven years, December has been a low month only on two occasions.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the burst of the tech bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds computer on its end-of-year rally.
The Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20h30, and to open on Saturday from 10h to 20h30.
Another group that also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for other agencies to join or not this initiative that coincides with business hours.
This is exactly what the People’s Bank is looking for.
Attracting autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to make their purchases in the SMEs and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies established throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renovation of those already existing.
To do this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s chief commercial officer, says the renovation will not involve large investments, but staffing, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People’s Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The Murillo Brave Street, O'Donnell Street and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and with success apparently, according to Rivero.
The People’s Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide hours, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with a staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
That's where we've come from.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect blurred his joy: 'What hurts me is not that we have increased more but that we have decreased less,' he said.
However, he emphasized the fact that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% over the past year.
The share value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave up 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other publicly traded communications companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that ' we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we profit from it in terms of audience."
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year’s first TV channel to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenue, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
In order for this to be true, the TV channel is expected to record a 3.6% increase in its advertising billing for the current fiscal year from $965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antenna 3's net revenue increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million), while television's net revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the stock market is the significant payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of profits on Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenna 3's earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which came into force on November 1
In addition to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MEPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of agencies for markets to function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the executives of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services for both specialised social and legal reasons, and creates a new type of financial services (ESI), financial advisory companies (FSAs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it is increasing the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which face competition from current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms, and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they perform, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Passing through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one that highlights that the securitized debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proven itself with what happened with the US high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after 1977, the Royal Decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists was approved.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require CNMV authorization, and who will be able to provide its product marketing and customer attraction services to different investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonized Consumer Price Index increased by five tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on the evolution of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily coincide with the definitive data that will be revealed on 14 December.
"CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1% increase in CPI in November was a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the corridors of the Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential about the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the minister acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock over three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time, he was amassing some record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to seize about a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion until reaching the 30,000 million target.
The group of tycoons Richard Branson, known for his campaign of criesadvertisers in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock has named Virgin’s offer this week, which includes three other companies, including its favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) earlier this morning because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
AIn addition, one of the municipal council secretaries and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current deputy of the right, and so far the municipal councillor of the city, and who, according to sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the "leader" of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Council and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As the SER Chain indicated yesterday to the lawyer of the MP 'of the popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession regarding the plot.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party’s candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be President of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus, the organising secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of that party with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician from La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career to dedicate himself to the fight against climate change in the academic context.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that even though citizens already know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or shouting" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already in his position to not fall, as he noted, in what his opponents might consider as "a domination".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subjecting both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to merciless persecution, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more so for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed decisively to Spain being at the forefront of the European Union in the non-execution of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, he must explain clearly to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will cause.
That is, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to one-hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed readily so dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have an impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he does not speak, does not denounce and does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is only a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we move by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the range.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation reported today.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at this time many officers met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Councillor's Office of Urban Planning and to the municipal enterprise for the management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six arrests made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of last illegal commissions during the last legal period.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Totana Court No. 1 is investigating.
The first six detainees have now been transferred to a court order.
According to sources, Totana's former municipal councillor and currently autonomous parliamentary member of the PP, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor from Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, the agency of the Nuaria Group, through which the bribes were allegedly carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was therefore arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who may have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that have been requalified and its project would assume to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in the most important newspaper in Finland (certain at the top of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the critique of Blackbur's book.
"The contents of the Philosophy course have challenged public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counsellor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that professors take a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat daily newspaper and he asserted that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.
Article 3
A colleague passes the information on the introduction in the Penal Code of offences on downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by a sentence of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in compact disc traffic.
Participating in a tumultuous fight implies a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would imply a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, under section 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real world, then someone is exaggerating.
Article 4
My treating doctor told me about one of her articles on strange research titled, ‘Money produces brain activation, especially if the others get less.’
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognitive imaging at the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed.”
The researchers observed that when the two people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main culprits in the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's List' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who prosecutes the fugitive criminals and puts pressure on the governments.
What insurance do I need?
Auto insurance, which covers the driver in the event of an accident, involves significant expenses that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age, age of the driver's license, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured, or the use that is made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of an accident.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, sex, age of the driver's license, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the odds to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower claim rate than their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
Increasing the frequency increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when determining the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various inconveniences when entering into a contract with affordable insurance, such as poor driving experience and the age of the driver's license.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is full-risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most foreseeable drivers can opt for an all-risk insurance with franchise, so that they get coverage from an all-risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the damage.
"The part of the amount of the damage that the customer pays will be determined based on the value of the premium, which will be the higher the amount will be low," said Luis Noguera, Spain's head of First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by for those caused on their own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be cautious and avoid damages as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic fare the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
“Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the profits of the company.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses," Noguera clarifies.
After the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to pass a contract with insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
This is why it is best to choose an all-risk insurance with frankness.
"Normally, young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously gained after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risks, as long as his financial situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claim rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with a franchise (which can be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed driving and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a larger amount of franchises," said Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, a full-risk insurance with a franchise is preferable (being 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us the most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow meet next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to reach their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified in the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica, who has four, does not pass in front of him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC is due to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final on 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the stadium Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that if they win they would stay first and ensure a better cross in the eighths of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but she won't be able to computer just on that since with nine points the game is back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the eighth finals for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth finals to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is the last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 People Attend Vancouver’s First Spice Girls Tour Concert
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before they began their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people ran out of tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video that tells the story of the group that became furious in the late 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that recaps their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI releases in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of Posh Spice had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the crowd that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' which was part of the group in 1998 'due to differences between us' and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed her nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
“I was nervous but I saw that people’s feelings have changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls have changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said at the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
Upon their arrival at the airport, an army of babysitters awaited them.
She has five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be exhibited in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine sounds the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas closes between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risks of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipelines, and each pipeline is carefully monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned monopoly company supplying gas, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for gas supplies from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would entail for Ukraine a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, reminding us that we are a country through which most of the gas passes,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would undoubtedly be related to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of Gazprom's supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supplies.
Russia has the largest gas reserves, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Union nations in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health "must control its foreign employees".
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its extra-community employees to check if they have any previous penalties, the monitoring committee said.
The Rev. Robert Black's warning came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the June attack at Glasgow airport.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any specific data on the number of overseas people it employs.
His report nevertheless highlighted other crucial checks, carried out correctly on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General conducted checks on extra-community personnel following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin serving at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after darkening with his jeep, in the gates of the main terminal.
He was among the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October on suspicion of being involved in various car blast attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the report of the Auditor General now states that committees are required to confront the Bureau of Control of Precedent Criminals, thus allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
“Although we have found that some staff information has been verified, this is not done every time,” the report said.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information about certain overseas personnel is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He stated "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings could bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities reported employing 1,161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems with the identification of indefinitely contracted staff, who might or might not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures of health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently reviewing its policy and pre-employment control system for overseas health service personnel.
Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, allied with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report, which is expected to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, which are valid for all employees, including overseas persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic on the latest Joy Division singer, Ian Curts, has won 5 awards, including Best Picture, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was cast as Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Mrs. Judi Dench has been nominated for Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety Award for allowing British film to be under international scrutiny.
The awards were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control chronicles Curtis's rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black-and-white film, which was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot with a budget of just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best novice director.
Rock has also been awarded the Best Documentary Award for the film of Julien Temple about the singer of the Clash, Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor Award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his performance of the driver of a Russian mob boss in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his bold character interpretations, won the Richard Harris Award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, having shot films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of the star Harris, who starred in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to cinema,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admirable in front of this great current actor, I was extremely honored.”
The independent film Oscars, better known as the Bifas, are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells handling an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and the armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the smugglers' cells of missiles.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006 on the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement from the interior minister said 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees appeared to have plotted the murder of ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against Saudi-led Iraqis, to join al-Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the allied Shiite Muslim government in the United States, considered heretical according to the hardline of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces during these five ... last months," the spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized in a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
The data from the European spacecraft in orbit showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation, has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The findings from Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
“Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
A kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said three people were arrested and the material is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the goods would be worth $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney has said he is not up to the task as a presidential candidate, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters have registered their questions, submitting them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, 28 November, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected the conditions of the Republican party, a candidate in the next election.
It is not known what criteria the producers of CNN, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest on a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong topics for Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to call when they hear pleasant things: The board has raised approvals when candidates are rudely speaking out.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr. Romney, who leads the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when asked if they would be willing to promote “amnesia” (offering clandestine people regular status and the opportunity to become a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, succeeded in deepening the issue.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps due to the fact that they started fighting immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: stiffer borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, coupled with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears of the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize, the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the content of the Bible in its entirety.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe the story of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, who was in Iowa in a recent election, because of his long-standing Christian conservatism, declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus is too chic to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s return to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research into grants led by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday’s debate.
These two have emerged out of nowhere, thanks to the fact that the two party-protected parties are unable to agree to decide who is the most well-known and traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly through a message of success about American greatness bringing leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No sold decorations, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra conjugal finger sucked.
But here is a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have gone through well.
Two months ago, the prime minister stepped back in his election bill, stupidly insulting British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls had not influenced his decision, and that he hoped on the contrary to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, stated that the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The acquisition of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the brink of crackdown, has demonstrated a flaw in guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative turmoil.
A trio of retired generals launched a rebellion among the Lords, protesting cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being a defense minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, suspicion of poor donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Labour Party (and his former chief of vigilance) have caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and do not trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even rule for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers take stock; the press searches for bad stories; and the government becomes on the defensive and with no goal anymore.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
Problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was British Treasury Chancellor.
And even if he’s not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party’s funds “with cash for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown faces is not so tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as members of the Tories party believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, might be to realize Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies of all time, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big donors of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams's programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser who spoke about suspicious donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even if most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has made half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making power is based on something he knows well, to resort to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Public Life Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on political party finance.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the Confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a supporter as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the election; it has two years to recapture voters, and the only way to achieve a victory is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see floats swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs think credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures the non-recoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly due to the weakness of cardholders.
It is still too early to panic.
The costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody’s, a tax agency, the third quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is nearly one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly due to technical factors.
A change in U.S. personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 caused a sharp drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry is also announcing fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly indebtedness that consumers must pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infectious links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debts now that equitable real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the cash flow rather than the value of the property, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily result in a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit card issuers.
Consumer premiums for paying mortgages fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; consequently, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the whole thing.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions because they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of having a rapid recovery of actions.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster of the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of having a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market are driving America into recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Pay attention to the back floats.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to go to testify against a fraud committed by Enron’s previous chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first pleaded not guilty to the seven charges of alleged collusion in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to get rich despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain due to extradition procedures that took two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The accusations made against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was being investigated by the government in Enron's debacle.
The charges against the bankers, dubbed the "Natwest Three", claim they came to Houston in 2000 to arrange a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hander, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, who helped him trick bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's interest from the subsidiary for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest for this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in reality, those $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the allegations, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year prison sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released following the payment of a bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh-largest national company, bankrupted in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its speculative bid as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in loss of market value and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been futile because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Neither under nor outside Moscow.
The cost of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs as many seats, given that it’s more of a family-run plane or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Show, an orgy of consumer incentives, for four days, held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like the 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche on display next to his booth.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world’s biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the wealthy are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists from the center of economic and financial research.
(The World Bank reported that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Jeweler de Soho.
“Women are all well-prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room, Sunday night, the two real estate agents bet on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, declare to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Mlle Yumatova, who grabbed her high-stitched dress like a veteran of the red carpet like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the plugs to come to a huge warehouse where there are Cadillac Escalades, platinum canes, Mövenpick ice cream, personalized billiard tables, our peluches and apartments in Duba<0xC3><0xAF>.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal factory stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturing Delf, in front of a mural of Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
“The Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
Indeed, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years is too much according to Russian standards) have already switched from flashy logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not sell at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, visit the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, on Thursday, Roman Ershow, CEO of King Koil Beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses embedded with gold wires.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 moto, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars to Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian said the term “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more than you might think”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company has erected four stands representing British telephone booths, filled with mass counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s chief marketing officer, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passengers arrested to throw lots of banknotes, asking their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the midst of this false wealth or packing a few millions.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unauthorized Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was the eve of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking out the bay window of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and observing an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, who the police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Mlle Arroyo's death, but they are waiting confidently for the results of the toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take time, but which are expected to solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been the assistant to Police Director Garry F. Mc Carthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
She was like a pit bull.
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and left two 14- and 11-year-old sons, as well as a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for the Union County Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine if Mlle Arroyo died from unauthorized surgery.
“This is an opportunity to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and having found Mlle Arroyo on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if a part of the house was being used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Mlle Castro's house where a faded rose tree lay in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the underground.
Two all-terrain bikes hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and again there when I left.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates related to the global stock market's effervescence.
Stocks exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, later reducing interest rates promoted by the US central bank’s soothing statements.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, said those who make decisions must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in turbulent financial markets.
In an apparent effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence has “inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
Should this severe turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of further rigid financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the U.S. markets, and that further interest rate cuts could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street down with even worse news on the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil were accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it would lay off 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 scored 165.5 points or 2.7%, finishing at 6306.2 adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for a sale at auction of quarterly funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at the hefty rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London's financial markets causing credit tensions has led to the UK's "Libor" monthly borrowing rates, which have continued to grow sharply since last September at 6.5 percent.
England faces a trial appeal against critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And more importantly, in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the head coach who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President and CEO of England, begins to fill in the application forms to become a less-time, national head coach.
He who fails to win the backslash #6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is also.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of luck more than by lack of skill.
It is not just in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is that right with Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives having obtained good degrees, professional, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the correct level of a cricketer unless they are given at least one chance?
The numbers have their importance in the decisions, but also in the opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to hit the cricketer one day.
But capturing the eyes of selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison claimed to be in full shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have already lived their glory time at the highest level and hope to offer more.
Whether it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and succeeded in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and this despite the fact that his double hundred scored against Australia are still under Australia.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and will favor Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start in the innings of the Test of 88 in Bombay, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten laps during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan was back in shape, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious elans in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy of living.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently slammed into a 4x4 at a presentation from Volkswagen, England’s sponsor.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from a distance, to ask him if he had "seen that?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his flying appearance allows him to do services that go to him, and he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could it be the true art of selection?
I would be in favour of giving Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has regained normalcy.
Some have returned to fight the militants who have driven them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to flee for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned home with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-backed militia had been able to drive Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad due to a grenade attack after it incited citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been attracted by the growing crowd of the capital since U.S. troops arrived, and to the sight of continuing training of well-armed “groups of citizens involved” and collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they were forced to return because of the visa issue and the decadence of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed suspicion about the exile visas that Shia Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki had asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of the sectarian squadrons of death.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki comes to Syria and urges the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni retired said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decline in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden influx of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state leads in the field of vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-defense, posts for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the country's children to higher education in a number above average - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we benefit from the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double-curricular panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Sarre has compelled higher schools to a marketing campaign in the subjects of engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
For children to start learning early, the last year of daycare is law-free - a model that other federal states are copying in the meantime.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students' performance is improving sustainably.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the number of at-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And despite the great sarrois, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by the PISA studies - one could otherwise earn points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Chávez sets watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon tic-tac differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the half-hour timer in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez is becoming a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, the clocks will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a case of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't, only because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe allegedly "cracked Venezuela's face" with this decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone is furious in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angry at the constant interrogations of leftist populists and told him to be silent.
Wage cuts threaten Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a real undervalue of wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their prognostic pessimist.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to see a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies with the low wage development, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economics and Conjuncture Research told Bild.
There could also be new burdens on the employee's unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected drop in unemployment insurance of 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the explosion in food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices have increased by 3.0 percent from year to year.
Venus is the Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus resembles Earth more than previously believed: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and windstorms at the poles, similar to those that appear on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today provided evidence of this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in the "Los Angeles" magazine.
According to the famous cyprin theory, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
Today there should be hardly any living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the Earth's infernal twin, but it remains a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of Venus Express in November 2005 was an important milestone in Venusian research, as no probe has been on its way to explore this planet since the 1980s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the latest research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only emphasize the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the points in common with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more than initially assumed.
In addition to the wind whirlwinds already known at the North Pole, the researchers found a cloud whirlwind at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon resembles air currents in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The so-called evening or morning star planet revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the party quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and summons the great coalition to close the quarrel over the welcome of the Dalai Lama.
“We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights are universally valid, even though I respect differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional policy of a single China.
“China knows it too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked for it outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the CDU's "foreign policy" in foreign policy matters.
After the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only dismissed the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from the Spiegel, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, Wen Jiabao supported the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama’s words and deeds would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not burst into the streets by violence, the German Interior Minister demanded.
Barricades burning, breakers shooting police with hunting rifles: after the serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also form in our homes and defuse itself in violence.
We must take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the communes were already firmly working to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From summits of integration to conferences on Islam, it already shows its early successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the warning.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems either from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police over the past nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government were required by the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigration would be higher than average.
First and foremost, there should be more places for training.
Kolat insisted: “We must give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish Communities, however, added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must still be cautious."
"Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training quickly."
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with spotlights.
The authorities reported three arrests, as well as some cars and garbage dumps burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, said Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, riots swept through Toulouse.
The riots erupted after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the reign of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor’s utopian entry shows that the coalition is done with the background – and there’s nothing to expect from her anymore.
In which country does this Chancellor live?
After her depressing intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics has been pushed back by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said and only showed by that that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate this accusation was.
There was no concrete interest or feelings for the problems of the country to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, who flees into foreign policy and who even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives will have to be achieved in our country.
Even the self-praise - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it even two years ago.
Now she clings to formulas all made, that growth would affect people.
In doing so, it destroys its image of pragmatism, which solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few extra phrases left for this.
In this respect, it is revealing how many times it makes lapses when it comes to family allowances.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to utter a half-accurate sentence.
It sniffs in unfamiliar terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension between the candidates is already erupting on the first subject.
He allegedly made New York a "refugee for the clandestine," Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
Giuliani responded by saying, “I would say his own home was a haven for clandestine people,” and blamed the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants.
Candidates rise to attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use CNN debates primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have uploaded via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
“It is with this kind of isolationism that we have let Hitler come to power,” John McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Romney is also being taught the lesson vigorously by Vietnam veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go between time beyond the war in Iraq and debates about torture can be seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are rejected, applause flows into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are again revealed.
"I made a mistake at the time," Romney said, apologising to the base and the television audience for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes through a flowing knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigned for the first time in civilian history.
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
Eight years of military rule ended.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has been suspended for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf has vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his command of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his takeover by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of state.
By this withdrawal from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Soon after his inauguration, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the state of emergency was instituted with lawyers in his ranks, dismissed all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are back.
The German supergroups of the seventies play again: the three members of the group Harmonia took their console again at a concert in Berlin.
For their return appeared recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at the evening poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable and above all their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by 57-year-old Michael Rother, who owns a laptop and guitar.
To the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes this inadvertently adds to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again has ensured some emotion among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to unveil it here: targeted polls reveal that, while the name makes sense in the collective memory of pop, in no case is it so durable that this group has been so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the Germans also have the right to celebrate their living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is mistakenly called "Krautrock" has always enjoyed more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and that during this period, the impact power felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubled himself in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile into the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farmhouse, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Commune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
There was supposedly a fanion of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art in the trash.
A lot of people keep Harmony away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
As serene and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood was not for its own sake.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just been released was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as well as someone thinks remember.
Rother emitted at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster came to life in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia has ever been.
We owe it to Herbert Grönemeyer for Griessem's live album.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been excavated on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocketbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be outlined with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase flies in the room amid the singular sounds: “The only true music you listen to is the future.”
There are pictures that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Projections of other black-and-white images of bazaar-wired tools serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and drums, to shoot instruments from unheard sounds thanks to the effects instruments built themselves.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three of them are great technicians.
Even the choir of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis at a nice moment.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought after in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the leaking of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who cries "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too is now no longer annoyed by it.
But what goes the most of itself will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can knock on someone’s nerves (?) or give fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Merciful Peace", two films once again address the Balkan war.
But both do not convince.
Either the projects are too much based on action and on the exchanges of foolish shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can not help.
The good news first: although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, it is precisely there, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had last lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many kind and futile roles in women’s sentiment films and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch anyway "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's films have to be as long and confusing as locomotive drivers' collective agreements?)
He delivers a magnificent performance full of blinks: at the bottom, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments for a long time visible behind him, but who, even as a decayed monument, remains charming.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Merciful Peace", which is also released this week, the endless sequel of missed films about the Balkan war.
The film tells the story of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovar snipers, in which one of the two quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are for once not presented as the only causes of all evil, this film as flat as a television movie gets lost far too quickly in the action and the exchange of senseless shots.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the bottom there has never been a really good movie about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track down the top war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in small teams in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to her a romantic adventure with a Bosnian who was subsequently murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world failed in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for a just revenge to the Muslim Bosniaks.
This is so bad that the International Criminal Court of The Hague should be brought against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt intensively enough due to secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the evil are this time so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiresome it is to be wicked."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumultuous heads, but that hint at how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been good movies about South Africa before.
What's worth every time: when a star lingers on a crisis outbreak or on a minefield, it then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits gehen Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood can make a good Holocaust movie with "Schindler's List."
Some films still have to mature - those that today are worth classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have never been celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But maybe today we also know too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this delighted the writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Dictator" actually became as good as either because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
“The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in a horrific way, and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust received criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's take-back from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has come under virulent criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games on the waterfront.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday's abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measure."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point for the longer term, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides to run for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports at the beginning of December, regarding the candidacy of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, in the time span that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitively belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to run for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß.
An abandonment of the candidacy would further contradict the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the plenary reception of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust reportedly described Hamburg's 2015 Universiade candidacy as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in recent weeks appointed Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD faction of the mayor blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics card and excluded the construction of housing," SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Little Grasbrook a plan integrated into the Olympics and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event Factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics would in turn have raised a lot of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' boxes.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and boxes in wood, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on the list of Warhol’s works.
A large part of the eighty Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" thus questioned the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol a few months ago, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm today results in a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the "Brillo-Boxes" at the Museum of Modern Art - of which the former director of the "Museum of Pontus Cadul" - has a
Ancient history is intertwined, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powdered soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, but rather about their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have some Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as original Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes authorized, with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum mistakenly claimed later that about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have ceded to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that date, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, besides the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other private Swedish collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminate panels were first printed and punched, then applied with a pincer.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied without a background layer on the laminate panels, using a paint roller - moreover, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not make such a decision as the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in its class, the Moderna will cope with them in six different ways.
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers give up, the same ones who had cut themselves off in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The soldiers in power had just before attacked the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal troops in power shut down the area around the respectable hotel.
The Chair convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have had enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who commanded the elite unit of the Rangers Scouts, said other units in the army would soon join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major protest against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
Manila's financial district has been the scene since 2003 of the attempted mutiny of some 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurgency broke down nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured a stake of more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company reported on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buy-in.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step, we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third party, according to the market.
The previous day, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million on the stock exchange.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a spokesman for United Internet said.
The two companies founded the company in participation MSP in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all options open, particularly to increase participation in the Freenet SA, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The hard-to-predict poker on Freenet, which has been going on for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile customers and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch held a 6.01 percent direct stake in Freenet so far.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about an additional four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
