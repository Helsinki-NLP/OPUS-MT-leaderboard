At the end of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange bounced in the negative
After Tuesday morning’s fall, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, at the start of trade, the Prague stock exchange resumed its fall the day before, when it lost nearly six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
The market's reaction to the outcome of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilization plan, is thus also perceptible in our country.
Declining shares in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices managed, over the course of the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trade, but later wiped out part of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange were losing more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“Hesitation about the US bailout will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong’s monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be at risk of being affected.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion K<0xC4><0x8D>).
The lawmakers thus denied the call for support for President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday and major stock indices experienced the biggest decline in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a fall of such magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Gives Up: U.S. Government Can Inject $700 Billion in Banks
U.S. Congressional leaders and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turning point in the talks on adopting a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
Success, however, is not certain.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulation Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to a vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor to revive financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, a "disillusionment" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences of opinion about the form the package of measures should take to stabilize the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be held as early as Sunday.
On Saturday-Sunday night, lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It should buy back from financial corporations the unselling real estate assets that cause significant losses to financial corporations and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
This market recovery plan still needs to be pursued, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on falling stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are making sure Congress reaches a definitive agreement as early as Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before the start of trades in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the Congressional decision could affect trades on Monday.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to say for sure when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote, or if the negotiations are not likely to be blocked at the last moment by this or that problem.
Legislators hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nonetheless, the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, should be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the option of blocking the granting of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed the progress in the negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the opportunity to veto it in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to pass the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated “the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the settlement of deductions, the development of the plan on the timeline.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of such golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who are having trouble paying.
The government should negotiate new deposits in the case of mortgages it is going to buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological help
According to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“And that’s because we don’t know what the mechanism and the price of buying back troubled assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, according to Marek, is not as important as that.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, starting this week, that they support this plan and that they dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, foreseen for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," Marek said.
A fight pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you on how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only a phone.
There is no doubt that there are enough reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy a high-end expensive gramophone for the house to put on the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on vinyl, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason, for this to happen.
Now, if there are stacked vinyl records in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you are at least likely dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same goes for music on the move, i.e. compressed music, to put it simply - music in MP3.
Also, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time carrying headphones bought for twenty crowns on the market.
There are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions unknown, of course, to most mobiles.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and sending SMS, it is able to play music and movies, record the latter, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, even serve for navigation.
And if we take into account Smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal nature of mobile is not without disadvantages.
The larger the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between two reloads.
And playing music is one of the most important energy goinfres.
Mobile phones that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours are rare, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, the music players (especially the most rudimentary ones) are significantly more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count on them to play music only for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second charge for work - this being true even for more expensive devices.
There will be no problem for MP3 players, which are able, following a reload, to run continuously for at least 9 hours, including the less powerful ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile device.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
When it comes to drives, you don't need, except (iPod), any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device coming from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will themselves create a media library sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or the user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a specific device, you are mainly interested in the life of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it only for a limited time, for example, taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3s.
Virtually all mobile devices are capable of this.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
Everyone gets to play MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will come up to you will have just this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
All you need to do is visit the corresponding web pages of the operator (or of another provider) from your mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical mobile.
The operator's offer is unfortunately miserable and is, in most cases, limited to quick-made radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile phones with them.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which have virtually all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can already have a very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best-equipped, also equipped with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy control.
Really anyone manages to secure the order of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a tape station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models generally support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones even get through with 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman phones (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of control is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman phones have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the farthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no longer room for another operator, makes a chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with his or her own network is apparently no longer very lucky (by the way, now it would be hard to find frequencies).
Now, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which, subsequently, conventional operators must also react.
Yet, even before the introduction of party-turners such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those heard today in our country were being heard in Britain.
However, it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We don’t have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator has managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let’s add that behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns the U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order for them to operate efficiently, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is how in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity hit.
In fact, this operator specifically targets men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work for us too.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for Vodafone, said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very proactive.
Mobilking will instead be launched in other countries in our area," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera Group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, has not, for a long time, concealed its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we managed to move forward in the negotiations," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Perhaps the future is promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
“At the moment, we don’t think there’s room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific compared to others.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová said in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not recorded at the moment a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
“It is virtually impossible for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Instead, Vodafone focuses its attention on fulfilling requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our opinion, means the most contributions from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore a decrease in their profits.
So what is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to understand each other like thieves in the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> web pages.
Nowadays, the U:fon is ready to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented on this: "The competition in the mobile market has recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
However, this is not only the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, the latter took its typical position in the face of this problem.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the leasing of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the potential stakeholders' offer has not a priori presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS said in response to our question.
A statement made in this way would not be surprising on the part of representatives of operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile phone services."
Pressuring towards a fair functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not in the interests of the <0xC3><0x93>OHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises naturally.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all gas stations is probably due to the chance and the fierce fight of the competition.
"The Office has not detected any signs of anticompetitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither of the operators has a dominant position, and consequently neither has an increased corresponding responsibility for their market behaviour.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably lacking even for the telecommunications regulator," Chaloupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market constitutes one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator logically has the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are apparently proceeding in a similar manner.
Nevertheless, the complaints of many interested parties (including the already mentioned GTS Novera company) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Reclaiming responsibility for the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common practice in communications, whereby the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act, an extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not succeeded, although many specialists have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know this very well, but their interests seem to be elsewhere.
When no one is looking, it can work
That said, the operation of some kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile phone services, but the latter are only partially public.
In most cases, it is about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Personalized mobile phone services are offered for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected officials.
The magic trick is that the company in front of the operator is a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you are referring to happened, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would review and that could lead to a termination of collaboration with the company in question," Kemrová said.
Nonetheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not reached even the heads of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is opposed to such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible profits, and at the same time, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot dispose of it fully, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators.
Now, that is precisely what should seem strange to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, there is another question to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively wide powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be content with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would occur, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a considerable reduction in the price of services.
Now, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, the conventional operators were striving, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in the developed countries intervened, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are treating this issue in the way of a hot potato from which one gets rid by transmitting it to a nearby target.
As a result of the experience we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable to them in these cases.
But let's not throw the sleeve after the beating.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our house, the Czech mobile market may get back in motion.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, a choir performance and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the server iHNed.cz.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national anthem as one of the most beautiful anthems.
As he had previously entrusted to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to make sure the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that the lyrics are well understood, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j resonated for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse des savoriers), a Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously adapted to it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce, on Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be inscribed in the history of the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravní povrond (Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pockets.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day or 90-day voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it both registered on their smart card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podron (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations of Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, M<0xC5><0xAF>sky za, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í, Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, Andál.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons online on the Dopravní povrond web pages: www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget the counters in the metro stations, where they had to tread impatience in long tails in order to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon online and it will be saved on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is a check-in with trained staff at the disposal of passengers, who will help those interested in buying online and, in addition, will save the coupon they have purchased on their card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Alongside the libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recall the machines to compost the tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
A vending machine will check the coupon in place of the driver
The automatons that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard smart card and the coupon purchased previously will register itself on the card.
Electronic vouchers are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
Peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the tickets Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of the transport in communal.
Peripheral buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
When embarking, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the checkout.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger would need to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take out-of-town buses and will not remember the date on which their voucher expires can rejoin the ATMs, originally used to save the coupons on the card.
This is where the information about the validity of their document will be displayed on the device screen.
Sudanese Demand Referendum in the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be incorporated into the United States.
This is the result of a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna (The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna.
Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov prayed in the letter to the US president not to allow "<0xC5><0xA0>umavská <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (forest region in southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation well and we want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter, signed, reads.
Given that the rallies with Czechoslovakia are supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, ruthless attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to always take into his hands the protectorate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava now.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state alien to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has contributed in no way to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of the post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudeten period.
While the Czech Germans had to at least anticipate that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some were expecting the United States and Britain to gain some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region's capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to learn Czech.
"They believed that once they got home, the Czech would be profitable to them," says Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war estimated, according to him, that, following the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An Emotional Campaign Will Attack Drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office says it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150-million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from speeding and alcohol driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It especially wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack the emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You do not think" is inscribed in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a bloodstain, there is the phrase "Tu pagarás".
This must symbolize that one can pay for life for a moment of inattention.
The spots will "handle" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of accidents can be commonly seen.
It estimates that this will result in a decrease in the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The Sugar and Whip Strategy Against Drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they roast a red fire.
The whiplash is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Risks must be reminded to drivers," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, signs signaling the danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static warning sign is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it anymore," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
In exchange for peace, Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories.
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli interim government, advocated the restitution of virtually all occupied territories in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert told the daily.
“We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without it, peace will not be made,” he added.
He admits that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
“He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the two attacks in the city in July.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work," he later pointed out.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also supported Israel's retreat from the Golan Heights, which he believes is a prerequisite for a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retreat," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shia movement); they will have to renounce the constant support they give to terrorism of Hamas (the Shia movement), Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network), as well as that of the D-jih.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move inside the bus during the journey.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally complied with, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said.
The accident in question, in which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus route.
The girl was sadly sitting next to the driver, in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two more seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even brake abruptly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing seats; this has been confirmed at Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This is a matter that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat," he said.
The law ignores stewards.
“There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward – no legal prescription addresses that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act knows only the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," added spokesman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law addresses the issue sufficiently.
"It all depends on whether the bus has in its approval the permission to propose standing seats.
It’s all in there,” he said.
Buses are divided into urban ones, where there are standing places and limited maximum speed, intercity ones with standing places and higher authorized speed and long-distance buses without standing place with the highest authorized maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the airplane, says an expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, an expert at BESIP (road safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in the aircraft.
Nor is it certain when a turbulence will occur and the hostess of the air can shake her head."
"Or, in the event that the bus would have braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
Same as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal regulations," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer stewards services.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession to be a risky profession.
"However, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky trade, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have any hostesses, we've opposed it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
An immense tragedy has come.
A young hostess from the Pilsen region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using flashing and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he crawled it from his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refused to sell the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but in terms of financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
A change to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been in the process of being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Department of Transportation, could provide clarifications on how stewards travel on board the bus.
"Now, she has not come to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of stewards to be fundamentally endangering the safety of passengers," said spokesman Hanzelka, adding that the control of the safety of buses is under the control of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Dusseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not lacking in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
Due to a union of the entities of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be constituted, according to the correspondence made public Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" doubled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive blow to other concentrations in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a board of directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is still under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that, only recently, has made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time has been taken into account in the search for a future solution.
For some time now, however, there has been a question - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of any kind between Deka Bank, which knows the clients of the Sparkasse through their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank, Franz Waas, said at the presentation of the figures for the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by both the Landesbanken and the savings bank groups, instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with the WestLB with a view to joint business activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, it is said in the financial square.
This is not the first time Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, counts as one of the most important employers on the financial square in Frankfurt, has come into play when it comes to consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab.
However, nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse was opposed to any participation of the Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, the other two houses did not join either.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate was attached instead to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had spoken out against any commercial strategy of merger with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the reunification of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the parliamentary elections in Bavaria have passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg could materialize in the first place.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for new mergers were to increase, the potential partners were gradually escaping.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she had so far withstood the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia Savings and Transfers Group, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, locked any union with WestLB earlier this year.
The NordLB would remain strict.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another facet is the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial question, namely, which business model should ensure the future capacity of the Landes banks, had not been solved by the German group of savings and transfers funds.
Eventually, a WestLb debugging could take place, debugging which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is discussed in the letter of the existing Steering Committee: in any case, a "global solution" for the establishment would be targeted.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, nearly a barrel of five liters of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors to the beer party what deep sounds his cock can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure at 11:45 p.m., <0x60>destinozione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing bears and already beside their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And as noisy, Marco Guarda explains, it’s not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For five years, they have been going to the beer party, already three dismissed just this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come home at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking group leader - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive at night on the Autostrada towards <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus, the passengers are asleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates once again pause just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the morning, Marco’s group finally arrives at six o’clock thirty as planned on the parking lot near Place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, get a little yellow hat.
Above is written on the left <0x60>Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
“When the doors of the beer shop open, we run,” Marco cries in the morning.
<0x60>Run!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
<0x60>Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room!'
The chope, cries Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the order!
<0x60>To show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!”
Third, 'Tonight, being back here at ten and a half o'clock!' Understood?
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow hats to the trees to find the way back, signs and even an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It’s the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the Italians’ weekend.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who set out across the Alps and collapse into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come expressly from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which produces statistics on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place before the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is especially appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Nights of insomnia for shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word "relatively" and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This was indeed the case this weekend.
The banker of the Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, receives from a consortium of German banks a loan of one billion to protect itself from turbulence of the markets.
A person in confidence in the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are issued up to an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate is now expected to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, it is the daughter company Depfa that bears the losses.
The state financer had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which has not been possible since the suspicion of markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity rate had also slightly weakened from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Ongoing and net profits from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period last year, with profits from the assignment of defined debts and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit operations falling from more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it was only thanks to the significant benefits derived from the repayment of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the profit deficit was moderated by about 16 percent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financer had initially misspeculated on industrial real estate loans, which had subsequently been affiliated with Aareal Bank.
Due to the fact that conventional state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations that should have on the calculation of the profits and losses of the group an essential material effect that still remains quite vague.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
Already by 2007, they had been truncated to two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate is, since the acquisition of Depfa, a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again dwindled considerably, with banks accumulating their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a portion - about 50 Billion Euros - of the Depfa's total loans of a short-term medium of refinancing.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing need is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of the international financial markets largely out of state currently.
Other sources say that refinancing would be ensured through the funds until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to the medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (Bafin) are based on the principle that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Group is now secured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors have to wait.
However, given the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank is, according to the latest statements, still on the doorstep of insolvency on Sunday evening, this at least provisional bailout will not be able to reassure the minds either.
The share price fell from 75 percent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.30.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While the debts at first have barely moved, the prices of second-rate loans are slipping.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and of course those that have a life expectancy beyond 2009.
The bonds of Hypo Real Estate Bank previously appeared to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the institution by the purchase of Depfa Bank.
As long as issuing institutions, governments and less-affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, one can assume a resorption of backlogs over time.
Or what no one dares to hope at the moment will happen – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed sounds of partial nationalization, the probability that was approaching security has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia primarily for long-term creditors on the decision of whether they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line on to constitute a deferment of losses for the next few years on the next automatically deducted equity income tax.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean? What does it mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
What was it that I was excited about?
The road to school was scary for me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, thankfully I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as with us in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock less twenty, a round of tables begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I didn’t have my school uniform yet, I wore an old mother-in-law skirt, as well as a shirt, blue rising socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I presented myself in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all had low Masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I knew him by my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor for the correspondent to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who was better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My foster mother had also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really different than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and algae salad, fruits and some sort of meat surrounded by tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salted confit plums, brrrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I'm curious if I could watch it here too.
“Why Japan in particular?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what?"
After all, reading manga has been my favorite thing for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at some point, I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have sensations.
A rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without which I or anyone else has so far been able to prove it just as we cannot prove that other human beings have consciousness.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we penetrate hard-to-practice grounds because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
Humans behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective life to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in leadership and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
Therefore, at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity might reside in the linguistic nature of man: much of his existence being related to language, it often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internally and subjectively, cannot be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses us with major problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious living, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their contents, and this is exactly what happened during studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does it mean for the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its aftermath, such as the body’s reactions) takes hold of living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to attribute them to others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities arise in the regions of the body sensation of the cortex and brain stem, just like Jaak Pankseep, who however focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in cross-sectional sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it is undemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in humans and in rats is likely to be felt as such in both cases: how could one still check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees from danger, but what if he feels fear?
In my opinion, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain stems, while cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brainstem the source of the sensations?
And even if we could prove it to humans, how could we prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress on the nervous plane as the same is measured in rats and in humans.
Since I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I know if sensations exist.
We could judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hitting myself against a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotional person.
UEFA President Platini: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a testament to its confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in cooperation with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the calendar of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"Uefa keeps an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer from it."
Several members of the Premier League have already been convicted of compulsory relegation manipulation in the previous season; in the end, the start of the League has even had to be delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid retaliated
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview – and is now in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adulter Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counter-attacks.
A Late Rose War for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage’s failure: “Dennis has been infidel to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his unfaithful husband’s qualification was clear: it would be “Monstruous,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News, that “Meg is once again releasing the story of our relationship and manipulating it.”
It would be even more “regrettable” that “the pain and upheavals that a divorce entails for every child would be revived in public” for their common 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the claw: "In any case, my life goes on.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that’s doing its best.”
Prices of air tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have been advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial services and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After prices in the hotel market have risen for years, hotel nights have already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed by another 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear, especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar exchange rate that led to a “declining travel craving for American tourists.”
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the drop in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are up 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy-class passengers have to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul, highly fuel-consuming flights have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economy-class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, business-class and first-class, however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
The German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
On the one hand, the reasons for this fall in prices would be sluggish economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand would yield ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the Open Sky Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the airlines' abolition of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that reportedly filed the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines only in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, SV Hamburg becomes the top of the rankings.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
The Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster Landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player returned to the game only late and his shot was unsuccessful against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he came out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered in the lobby of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the locker rooms, the half-time was over and most had sat down in their place.
Rieger has been the HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as a good old protagonist.
And that is why his request was received at the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol agreed and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
Implementation has failed.
"Everything wasn't very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have liked to be more relaxed too.
This 1:0 (1:0 in the half), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful header by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Marin Jol summed up.
The SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
As early as Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional charts on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take a step back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the First League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late entrants - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen from FC Bayern - is forming smoothly, but it is not yet shining.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol said.
After the Failure of Voting
On Wall Street, there is fear.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones to temporarily fall by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in a day in all of history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little bit better.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index was 10,579 points with a decline of well over five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock index was 1548 points with a decline of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that time American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could bring any more profits.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell nearly ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the bailout plan, funds must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial corporation that can be traded in correlation with price developments in order to reduce their burden on the Treasury.
The prices of shares sucked into the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not alleviate investor concerns.
The price of the stock of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the bailout of the financial market foreseen by the state.
Spectacular declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The share of the Bavarian real estate financer has so far lost three-quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank blamed a decline of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped significantly below the significant psychological bar of 6,000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Around the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion heavy bailout plan could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the opening hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, with the vote in the Senate expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also experienced only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 percent for the time being, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after a 1.26 percent rise.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
The multinational trade and tourism company has also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers perplexed: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what are called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon frozen fuel lines, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain an additional impetus in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, just like the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent the way they are expected under the venerable laws of gravitation.
In addition, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the abnormality of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is to say, it does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their kidnappers, the abducted tourists in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-release shooting, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom were already underway.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was reported jointly by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the newsletters of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their state of health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and safe, Egypt's national television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion are expected to be on their way to Cairo.
Circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released remain vague: the kidnappers were reportedly close to ending the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security official, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting station.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the agent said.
The only thing left to do was to pick up the hostages,” when suddenly, “this surprise” occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot down six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be handed over by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abused by a father-in-law who led to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight charges of indecent conduct.
Truro’s high court ruled that he regularly tied his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Mlle Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and tied her up before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Mlle Randle, a regular National Trust volunteer, was haunted by abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told her that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, seemed "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's beautiful father, who had written a confessional letter that ended with: "I tied her up and tied her regularly."
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been certainly terrified, especially at the age of 7.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the victim’s suicide.
And what is even more astonishing is the fact that if she hadn’t done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: “I emphasize in particular, as his father and mother describe, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
Without them, she would undoubtedly be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today.
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Office Cabinet minister who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC reported.
The Department of Defense man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They will have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Department of Defense and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the departmental officer be placed under the tutelage of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Secret Service Committee.
The documents he lost included assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies facing the B&B invoice.
The British construction companies could have to pay an invoice of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million, to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys’ 2.6 million savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building companies.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it was “irritating” to know that companies and their members will have to pay for broken pots and pans.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will rise at the same time, will be debited, every year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is annoying to see that institutions that have been cautious... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the Building Companies Trade Committee, told the BBC that the decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have been cautious in the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for much less cautious institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, date of the first annals.
“We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salary bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid throughout the year, which could double.
Since building companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either with higher charges or with lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases by up to five penny per liter
The people of Jersey have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five penny per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase following a two-penny increase in February, following a search by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide whether to go in turn, raise the price to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had been varied for the last time, in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh has been denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who may be arrested on his return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to give her bail because of her probation for extorting 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) from a businessman when she was PM.
This is one of the many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country’s provisional military government first give him his full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free on her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court order.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request saying she does not require bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took power, but was released in June to treat herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Zhaleda Zia deny the accusations against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The UN last week carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she says she has not been able to contact the children of the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB Loses ITV 's Judicial Battle
BSkyB lost its case following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB’s participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unjustly influence ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to effectively prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's purchase of shares in ITV raised doubts as to ITV's effective independence, and consequently prompted the Competition Commission to investigate.
Virgin’s boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the regulator Ofcom were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB has argued that forcing her to reduce her shares of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorney General's case.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to examine the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole thing came from the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the removal in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to give political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others reportedly refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting the courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was recently accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and eventually resigned.
A number of departmental officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as a leader," notably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator, Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic should be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to receive this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit 1977 album Meat Loaf.
The awards evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year’s selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly a part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in the English charts for nine years, and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – or Marvin Lee Aday, by his real name – has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure his irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a severe laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in her vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be On Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents do not know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From about 30 feet wide to 120 feet long, it resembles a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
There are no signposts on the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to reshape Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to the shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the city's Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development, which runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighborhood owners' committees, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the property builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the #3 Committee.
“There are few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place,” she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to rebuild the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a coffee shop to which the builder would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, that does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relocate this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city that suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, stressing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named after it since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's many children's large farm was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The rear entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of garbage, hailstones, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity- a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be fucked in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow bag-ass, dark by day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of last week's newspapers flying along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs swiftly down the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a 22-ounce bottle of beer empty, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passersby have stated that they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, for his part, said he thought some of the subs were appreciative of the street's attractiveness in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have taken place in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California student and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think. Why Middle Classes Should Be Able to Choose Their School."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign emphasizes that “African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program particularly supports among so many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that advocates classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students at this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 State Mathematics Examination, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the English-of-language-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to an ingredient other than that of Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street focuses on analysis, practice, constant assessment of abilities as well as an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school has instituted the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total immersion in English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Mikels, opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you wouldn't have had a chance to identify him."
"It works, she observes, "it worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama’s response.
While it is favorable that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant when he proclaimed that we must all stop controversy over the English-language wording of laws.
"On the contrary," he said, "you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than despise them or consider them insignificant.
Net Oil Drop Following New Concerns in the World of the Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people fear the bailout plan for financial marches will fail to bring the economy back to life.
The futures of crude oil fell by 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel. The New York Mercantile Exchange, during sales this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street’s financial turmoil, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 per barrel last month, before bouncing back in view of deep uncertainties in financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again concerned despite the agreement on the largest bailout plan in history, concluded this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, Citygroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this weekend’s frenetic negotiations, concluded with the bailout agreement, “seem to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchanges has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“With regard to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally and particularly in China.”
Analysts of the bank reduced their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecasts of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Second Time Festival Determining the Improvement of the Team's Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets’ Shaun Ellis uniform, the defender thought he had seen it all.
He watched the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played under dark clouds.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when one corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from halftime.
"I didn't get out of my area" Favre said about all his passes at Coles.
"He's a mediocre player."
“We communicate extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense beat Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a missed shot and scored 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 lead.
It was the best that the Jets could have scored at one time.
The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second time or the third?"
When he was told the two- the Jets left 21 undisputed points in the third half- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the best cross-country rider of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03:59 victory in an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie broke his record of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, played last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1,600-metre marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing – perhaps exaggerated in today’s eyes – that air pollution is increasing her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at start, 55 on arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to cross-country runners, have contributed to the reduction of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, suffering from calf cramps two weeks earlier, and missing training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain shiny, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I did it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better.”
He was blamed—especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s African rival—for having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding world marathon stars, actually counting on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a cross-country runner.
On Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. midway.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the heads of line disappeared.
Just over three miles away, Gebrselassie made his final ascent to detach himself from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by five minutes.
Kamathis is third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving on her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skillful strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders to take a nice advantage, then surpassing them about 18 miles 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 later.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first entirely black city to be integrated, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make today." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas and two school steps.
It has now become a pilgrimage city.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, which takes place every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes has become a tourist destination thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project remains a place apart.
It is as independent, dignified, and private as it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, who "knows so little of us, does not know what he is losing".
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of foreign eyes.
"We are very cautious about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, a 59-year-old resident and the city's oldest parishioner.
"It must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historic model of black power as well as a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture – sometimes despised, sometimes acclaimed – that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere, dialect-filled books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses central Florida, often forgotten, that ends up in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Courageous as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"Passing the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as everything that can be used to people passing by.
So, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn’t really a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora has well described the reality," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's young daughters that Hurston immortalized, citing colorless songs performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered as a vivid and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually came to town without warning, aboard a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many mocked her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his chair from the back patio that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a 2003 Hurston biography.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Officials in Orange County wanted to cross a five-lane highway into the city, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among so many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing dispute led to hatred at the gates of the community.
“At that time, a band of young white people were throwing oranges or objects at the people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
"A lady has even died."
They threw a watermelon from their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education as “insulting rather than glorious to my race.”
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened the confidence of young people.
“Black children used to be kissed – I remember well – they kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief executive of the Eatonville Community Surveillance, a not-for-profit group.
It lasted, she added, until the time when teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white -- I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," Mlle Nathiri said.
Civil rights, by the way, have created space for many more Zora Neale Hurston--black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as her, armed with a joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It surpasses me.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to the American canons.
The highway project came just at the time when Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences this highway would have.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal of the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summarized the whole stating that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A mono-themed library (of course renamed Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, rebuilt.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a backstreet on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90% of the population is black)
The strangers who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and certain things—such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields—must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mlle Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, with the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It's a lot of sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
“Most of the people who pass through this area will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to look at history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone is fluent in finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York are spending the worst "office day" since the 1929 crackdown.
Deliverers continue to crawl on the sidewalks, with their trolleys and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latinos still linger among the residential buildings wearing, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic narratives until this afternoon when I decided to go open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I was discovering at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people lined up.
Not in front of the cash desks, or to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service desk, where the regular customers ordered their checks, the tourists asked the management for the Macy's store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," all lined up for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit unions, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and that say they treat customers as their family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327, has resorted to the bankruptcy syndicate, and as New Yorkers return home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that they think is reliable, the one that does the most bailout on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her skinny CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge in my building's uniform, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or my fruit and vegetable dealer's deliveries.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take any risks.”
Muslim tombs desecrated while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating red-striped mosques.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning, according to police, an organized action.
The offenders painted on several tombs, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives think this could have been done to disguise the extremists’ hatred of Muslim immigrants.
This accident could somehow be related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said it was “deeply shocked” by the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that is approaching its end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that garnered nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign, with some of their slogans even considered, according to critics, to be xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against wearing scarves and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities that have him under control, his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Kent Police issued a travel ban on Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse to the magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in Ashford's courts of limited jurisdiction, but was nonetheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court said: "On Thursday 25 September at the Ashford Court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present at the time."
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even though he was not listed on the list of sexual abuse accused.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss particular cases or Glitter's potential displacements in the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: “The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, much more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the most dear intention of the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well, and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he departed for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on Aug. 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, was going to the Uxbridge, West London, court of limited jurisdiction for being listed on the list of people accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the UK for holding images of child abuse.
A source at the Interior Ministry said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from traveling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no outfits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and stolen glances of artists who do not care to get on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programme of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists.
These people photographed “on the street” are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists, you should not take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a character of their own.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of flamenco stars.”
With the festival "Popular Song of the Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the material, recall the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and that surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the “Portraits of Old Sportsmen” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing people's portraits, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a moment more or less.
I think that in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or that leave you only a few minutes to be able to take a photo of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 de la Rue de la Mata (a street parallel to the People of Hercules) which will be open until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true bold"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he is working, a novel that features the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and who has gone through the war.
The Nobel Prize-winning author confessed at the Hay Festival Segovia yesterday that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real audacity" and that "everything demonstrates that he shouldn't write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't, but I will and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people march through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the votes of the participants, filled the theatre with Juan Bravo.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in front of a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to his "how to read" and "how to live" experience.
The Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, an ephemeral experience", stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has not been possible for people to go" and "revealed the effects".
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco fair
The banner festival that concluded the bullfights at the Pozoblanco Fair was suspended yesterday morning, after horseback riders checked the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The bad weather was hardened at this fair, since in the end two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
On the poster, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the feast of Friday took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
In the afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the uncovered steps applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Julio, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whispered by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours less ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two undertake the escape.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, from which to stop them.
Police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Basque Government's Department of the Interior.
The person arrested was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit were carrying out a vehicle control on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
Police began chasing them until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the side, where the two occupants went down to flee into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch ballots, and they then transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with the one written on the gray card of the van, which is why they also charged the detainee with an offence of falsification of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the whereabouts of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., has been charged with carrying out the various proceedings and will be tried within hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Drug Effect
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her doing strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman for the California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear “was pushing the accelerator down, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going backwards several times, she was riding on her sunglasses.”
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who had initially not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous depression.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out treatments in favour of his family members.
"In those cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the political party's behavior that he will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left called for the investigations to be "transparent" for the irregularities Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict codes of ethics for all civil servants".
"Blood of Mayo", Garci's bold bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Blood of May", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with almost 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker has tried to "stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the top of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, Blood of May, will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a more than four-hour television series for Telemadrid.
A great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures that with this filming he has realized "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to make a commemorative film for the two hundred years of 2 May Madrid, which he has always accepted nation when the story is told.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been mistaken as a leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII".
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Blood of May" - because he was unable to shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated throughout his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he has the habit of rehearsing before starting the filming and to whom he does not cast, since this seems to him to be "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to inform himself to go to the theatre".
Many actors in "Blood of May" rehearse in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times nominee for the Oscar (he has won one), Garci considers that the three nominee films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood," Blood of Mayo "," Seven tables of French billiards "and finally the winner," The blind sunflowers ", are not better representative of the young Spanish-declared cinema.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize you’re working for prosperity, and now you’re just making an extra movie,” Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the shoes of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a sevillian dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and at the age of three she will live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset, which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to play the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a Cuban folk dance and "the snake dance" of some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers,” she says.
The setting was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who would sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with her who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me.”
The staging was also considered thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; to the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as to the violin of Rafa El Viola and to the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra de Juáterel de Gen, who were the co-stars.
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it’s these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and values her work,” Bayón said.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennale
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal d'un Poète récemment marié" in the church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia Priércer the "No" and the "Triennati" anni to celebrate the "Trienat 2008"
In this way, the "Trinity Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated in May last and which, after having been held in various provinces of New York, will be internationally celebrated.
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a Poet Recently Married", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America pleases less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been touring since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels goes beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better because of his existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly obscure period, when terrorists and the stock markets are frightened, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, human beings have only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the advocate of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his eldest son who died after an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond had died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the height of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He put us at the top of the bar,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to break through the screen like Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and away from goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even though he did not lack the opportunities to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as his devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and philanthropist,” he said.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympics
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I have ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, these would be the subject of an elimination note.
But let’s look at it in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the backpacks, which forces you to go there in advance.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the backpack (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and consequently cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place in the barracks.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this one would not come to me.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the Emerging Technologies conference at MIT, Microsoft presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle that asked him to move into a campus response.
Thanks to a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this “receptionist” can know how many people there are in the place, who they are – including remembering what positions they occupy – and listen to and hear the keywords of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she’s here to visit someone and she tells her she’ll answer her in a few moments.
All without a blue screen.
Awesome.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essential instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding features and "extras" to Windows.
Change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance, but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right. I'm sorry.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only turn on the computer to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who uses half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will need to contain fewer apps, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, months crowded, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo featured in this article, was taken earlier this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Parrain' and is part of the holding of the Association of Muscle Gays.
And if we start to list all of his apparitions, we could also mention this mustache who was lifting weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple men's cotton bodysuit, moulding and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to the legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' stands out from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most well-known bodysuits have in the neck.
But beware, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His huge resemblance to his sister did not stop him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new business in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters, but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish house.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us about what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s delights us and we are very inspired by it for our collections.
I really like to walk around the city and watch women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was little, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers love to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you put on the clothes, that’s when you really put on the character’s skin.
So, everything is connected.
You were not long 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are delighting me.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mom because my body asks me to be a mom and, moreover, I want to be a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you wait for the different movies you made last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I am looking forward to the release of the films 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo'.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the gateway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the catwalk to be a model.
Simply put, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two garments from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to collect money.
The people that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
Besides, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Driving alcohol recidivists will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle in a state of drunkness, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the Minister of State's report in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its goal is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety, as well as the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, take the car back.
The alcoholic would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than authorized.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced offences by up to 65% during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This only applies to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, reform done by criminal means requires a reform of organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental form.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install in school buses this system as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., scheduled official time, the Spanish Air Force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling was landing in the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico.
The sun was about to set, but its rays still required a hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Ah, all right, so we won't be able to go to the airport to pick up guests at this time... are you from here or...?
- No, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Ah, all right.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military rank consisting of 27 marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before passing through the hall where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a rigolo journalist from Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious award in fashion
There is certainly no place in the world more suitable to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is certainly no cartoonist living more extraordinary and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be awarded with a prize of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her models in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she was almost crying with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of area.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, have led us to a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the adjoining table of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having a big heart and making good heart against bad fortune, due to the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some ELAH trims, which cut the breath, and arm on, arm under with her son Luis - a handsome man nearly two meters high - she went with Valentine.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron de Rotchil finished the evening without a jacket because they had loaned them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a big pants and a shirt ' she made - from her own collection - and who for dinner has transformed herself wearing a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a good time and folded the ball back.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace dependencies, but she showed us earlier on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked in advance, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1,000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to libraries on September 30.
The wake-up call almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 o’clock, but it’s even worse when we think of the hectic pace that current life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each person.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at bookshops directly from publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run through your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk at night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk during their sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somnilocchia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, there are more than one who talks at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its occurrence.
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (pissing in bed) or somnambulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations or overexcitement.
Anyway, this is an unstudied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, murmurs or, on the contrary, with screams, tears, long speeches...
In the event that sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleep talks appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It is useless since he is unconscious and you would wake him up.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he shows himself very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he’s saying (which is not usual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You won’t get anything, because sleeping, he’s not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he is saying, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern has finally found his way back to victory on his field after a long hiatus.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the most opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very supportive during this meeting where the attackers had a hard time expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visitor captain Kauffmann who was rummaging the lantern on a long shot, Ilhaeusern was going to take the ascent slightly and round Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Roman from the end of the foot or even Diebold came to cough the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we were making a block in the middle of the field and just left the stirring Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the goalkeeper Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the dressing rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any major problems to an Illyrian Eleven who has just stepped back a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last seconds of the game where, after a large snag, the ball passed very close to the crossroads.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a detour through Britain.
Faced with the strong demonstration of fishermen who severely disrupted access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, on Tuesday morning, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come up with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to get measures against the rise in gasoline prices, which has reached a record high of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of stops.
Quiberon's marina was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not stopped.
A filter dam has been put in place on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, as early as dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic and the Channel, such as the Sands of Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers stayed at the quay, or the Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of merchant ships.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the important Total Donges refinery in the evening.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the planned interview with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Brittany fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will leave nothing behind" and "do not want to move to Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline taxes, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they believe that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a gasoline less than 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy and the Kid has died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes have hailed the film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian airliner expects 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that flare up on the global economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 deliveries forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the airliner delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which the U.S. monetary authorities have redeemed, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to reimburse the $85 billion in advance, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its business beyond its international life insurance and retirement business in the United States, the newspaper cites sources close to the file.
The Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to consider possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Assets that AIG plans to separate include its aviation leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision has been made on these transfers, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan the Federal Reserve granted to it at the risk of the U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting current shareholders in due proportion.
Analyse Paris Historique de la séance Morning Meeting Historique Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange on Monday accused a historic fall after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bailout plan for banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the definitive closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the bank bailout plan that was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“It shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come “too late.”
“If the project is actually dying out ... then the relay will quickly pass to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, Piegza said.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities arranged for the acquisition of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting emergency responses to banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not only an American crisis, but a global crisis,” FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632%, compared with 3.827% on Friday night, and that of the 30-year Treasury bond to 4.161%, compared with 4.357% the day before.
Obama Wins First TV Duel Points
The first debate on Friday between the two White House candidates was followed by another to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won it.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes McCain’s performance, though honorable, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stave off his five-week drop in presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% vs. McCain), believes it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious for 39 percent of the respondents, while 25 percent of them concede the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the expected good performance of his collie, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She’s got good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, while emphasizing his opponent’s “naivety” on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he has accused on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama, however, insisted that he represented the future.
Without disassembling it, it proved concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still hasn't understood, while Obama has," a Democratic spot retorted this weekend, accusing the Republican of not taking the full measure of the crisis' impact on the "American on the street."
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina.
He did not even pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial overthrow clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable of saving the economy on the brink of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle “is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would still manage to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite Wall Street overshoots, the Illinois senator also pointed out that achieving a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a sanitation system.
McCain said he wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, the two candidates have shunned questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election, did you?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as polling stations in Minsk’s central square closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit they haven’t even voted: “What good is it, since they will do what they want with my voice,” says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime, which has given a good image to foreign observers in order to take up language with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections were considered clean by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We have been kept out of the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the stripping," said Iouri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexander Milinkievich, a former presidential candidate and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our country it's the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space for television, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stresses that the participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote by anticipation (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
"Have you noticed that there was an election, you?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five MPs from the opposition in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls again on the square in October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The Interview - Blood Becomes Safe Again
Héma-Québec was celebrating the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And most importantly, he regained public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public outcry, the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was delayed in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Corporation to supply all other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work in the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," she said, proudly saying that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its inception, on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease were seen in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, measures are put in place.
In April 1999, blood was refused to people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Now, a few years ago, it was undoubtedly demonstrated that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode has thus shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied makes sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid testing (TAN), which allows the presence of the virus itself and not antibodies to the virus, directly in the blood of donors, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs allowed to shorten the silent period, which spans between the moment when the person was infected and the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors may be infected without their knowledge and that they may not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that one can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to regain health," says the head of Hema-Québec's management.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year appeared on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr Décary, noting that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
“The needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cell or platelet refills.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
Any healthy person aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria can still donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a malaria-stricken country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Since today’s life is so hectic, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating our blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago the bank-sale of our thousandth cord blood sample and more than a thousand are expected to be taken each year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year,” says Dr. Decary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Multiple mothers are disappointed to not be able to access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL's first division elimination series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 total of goals) win at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the series quarterfinals total of goals, at Stade Saputo.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the rest of the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first round of the series, on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the back game to win it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the 5-4 semi-final round in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's victorious goal
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian in the dam shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first half,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a great ovation.”
Charest bet on the North
Prime Minister does not rule out holding elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of today's partial election.
"Putting back the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest has presented with visual force while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin in images.
On three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great resources as in the election period.
In a press release, the prime minister refused to rule out that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth strand of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labor agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give timelines, investment amounts, or specific priorities in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Mr. Charest's listing.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's in our country, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press release.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
"With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open all year because of the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekistan MP from Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Nord Plan will be “concerned, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has forged the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press release, he invoked another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
“It remains between us, but I plan to be there,” he told his activists, arousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election this fall, which the law allows him.
He stresses that his schedule is, however, being fulfilled, notably by a mission of the federation’s council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, in particular "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular demands recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they would have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad lines of the Northern Plan have been welcomed with skepticism.
The Pekingese leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry Government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had, "we would be more advanced today," commented Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (ironically) in the Harper cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To cast the disgrace on this woman who has fought an unceasing struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
We are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its national imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts he was accused of.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier croup under inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
As a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can enjoy a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of exactions.
We don’t realize it yet, but we are currently witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” the word that Harper keeps branding and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality: a Canadian citizen can be mistreated, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned according to the goodwill of a minority head of government so far (what will happen after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing to the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is here, in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a defamation lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small, unpaid publishing house in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamatory prosecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the nearly bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will scare the opposition and frighten anyone who dares to look again at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public opinion that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada normally take place through the exchange of ideas and not by punching.
It was therefore sufficient for the mine to open its books, files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust the public and rejects petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while despising the opinions of that same public?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word only refers to high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports Black Canada's authors and publishers do so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not within the framework of what many perceive as a prosecution-buffalo (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has, moreover, filed a notice at the place of the authors of Black Canada's term of intimacy).
Beyond Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s pursuit is a direct attack on academic research freedom and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of repeated prosecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, both Republican and Democrat, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
It includes: better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, and a right to look at wages paid to managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing Wall Street crisis,” she said.
"That's the fundamental point: if we don't do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption to Americans' daily lives will be immense," Gregg said.
Negotiations had turned to sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect that a further failure on the investor’s mood would have.
The agreed time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election have been rather favorable to the agreement, but have not failed to express their dissatisfaction that we are forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that aimed at allowing owners to retain their homes and that on the salary of the executives of the companies rescued by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be commended.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on American television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The big lines I’ve read [show] that it’s something that we’re all going to have to digest and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to redeem dubious, risky assets from U.S. financial institutions with taxpayers’ money.
It comes after 14 months of a financial crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subprimes) before expanding to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and bankruptcy.
It was a group of Republicans who overthrew the first draft of the deal last week.
It is believed to have emerged from this deadlock since Democrats accepted that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round the corner for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government had to bear losses for five years with this program, it could set up new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion should be approved by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain stakes in the rescued companies that will give him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the torment has passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing related to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and severance payments paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The plan's architects would like to see him put to the vote in the House of Representatives as of today, and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one about taking advantage of taxpayers.”
A small group in Congress called "the caucus of the skeptics," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to carefully consider the path to take," he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up to acquire its competitor in the midst of shipwreck since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion (US$2.9 billion) in the U.S. mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
“This is not lost money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, one recovers a right to vote in the bank and influence.
This is precisely something that savers and households appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed about to nationalize another bank damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Committed Icon
Its beauty in the eyes of blue has long been its asset card, some will say its weakness.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the register of power that gives birth to true sacred monsters.
What a great racer!
Paul Newman, who disappeared Friday from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch at the age of 83, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the fastest years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the break-up of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality brand.
For in him was projected a whole country loving the self-made man, from the warfighter of the Pacific, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, on television, soon in cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the motorist who ranked second at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, dubbed a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadow zones of this secret, discreet, committed, allergic to the breakouts of show-business, of which we will not have completely penetrated the enigma.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman caused dizziness in movie theaters this weekend, as his major roles on the black screen of memories clashed.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parades through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, resumed after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic miscarriage in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on his return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in nine nominations in 1987.
That face through the ages, it was him.
It's him again.
Epochs move through its course.
The young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's highly cultivated Slap Shot (1977), by Reggie Dunlop, the coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the Irish mafia sponsor in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was looped.
Contrary to several film legends that left the profession quite early, Newman will have remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its fasts and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles for a long time fell all cooked up in the mouth.
However, he played less often the young firsts than the marginals: neurotic, alcoholic, savage or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed facets not well known of his true pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes poured yesterday on Newman, his great buddy and ex-weapon Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad, "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant features of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, and a protester for Hollywood's drifts.
We have seen a lot of his binette reign over jars of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process quite bad taste, although gag at first.
The profits from these sales were, however, paid to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing these sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag & amp; Company do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly significant damage; other charges have been brought against them, such as false and the use of false ones.
According to the prosecution, money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand into the boxes of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, into the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to get the money from the grants obtained by issuing expense invoices, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus the associations never met their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills were false.
For the latter, they procured invoice books at the Józsefváros market, while making the seals at Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the deposition of the latter, he had to spot pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the model of which they would make the other invoices that they would introduce, inter alia, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drafting the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados's choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, which would later bear the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, was fraught with flaws in form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could stay overnight, yet the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
Bill issuers with overflowing imagination also fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, which also belongs to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért nor that of the Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were false documents.
"Our company name and tax number were placed in the wrong place on the seal."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, a hundred people stayed there, did not fit either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Zealous invoice issuers also did not inquire about Budapest travel agencies, being part of their choice, but only organizing trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
Moreover, as was apparent during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while travel benefits, whose destination is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp on the order of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ert was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the employees of the hotel issued only invoices to be printed, as soon as the invoices were issued.
The prosecution investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in referring to the carriage of goods by road as a service, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was investment advice.
Moreover, it is also for vices of forms, such as inadequate bill types and false seals, that the bills issued on the order of Együtt to Armadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and of Biztos Pont proved to be false.
As in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the sports internship in Kunfehértó, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also paid no attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at their home.
Invoices Deliberately Established
Another category of invoice issuers is those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal group - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established an invoice for the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> association which was not effective in providing the five-millions of Egyesület.
There was no financial movement, either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was avoided by the agencies in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the CEO of the company Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where he was not found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipments were allegedly purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov also reportedly sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the Atlasz, Hoppa and Együtt companies to Armadik Evezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were operating, which the defendant explains by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused and editor of the company's founding documents, he established invoices on their behalf, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generación.
Kubatov gave organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as the VAT went into Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont’s grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generación Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy in the amount of twice HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid confusion, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In fact, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of making the invoices, as they had done before the prosecution.
What might be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the slightest detail, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the Socialists would have concluded an agreement under which in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since applications for his placement in supervised residence, on the basis of a relief from his conditions of detention, continually fall into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more damage, and the perpetrators of economic crimes that cannot be repaired, are walking freely or at least, they are waiting at their own home for the end of the procedure.
The Psychology of Over-Auctioning: Why Do We Spend More Money?
When auctioning, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans do not want to be distanced from this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay a price too high.
This research has attempted to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain areas of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the over-auction of a third party, the whole under the brain stem, called the striatum, moved intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the nervous system's "self-stimulation" mechanism.
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economic members of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups were overpricing a partner under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and so they made their bid.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15, in reward.
While the third group received him those $15 before the auctions, the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was on victory in one group, and failure in the other.
By proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the players' team "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
One hundred miles is estimated to be the number of patients with the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles are treated, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B anyway. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming contaminated foods, usually accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stools become clearer and the urine takes a darker color.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know about the virus, because the pathogenic gene sneakyly destroys the cells of the liver. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your treating doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the organism, thus the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article in which researchers from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing the extent to which belief in God could influence tolerance for human pain.
As part of this at least bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them was observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a palpation technique of the human brain, it was also possible to discover that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university participate.
Specifically, the experiment takes place as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look closely at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at the Hermitage painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a sort of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, concerned its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and in the meantime, received 20 electroshocks in four parts successively, while looking at either the religious-themed or the more general-themed painting.
The Catholics said that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe”, as someone who is “cared for” and they “calmed, and peace has invaded them.”
In view of the religious theme painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided they find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change and in many cases, it actually changes our personality,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if the believers were shown a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would a better quality view of the Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets just like the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their interests are.
However, this is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the most influential people in society.
As for the skeptics setting a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they don't see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times recently that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can meet their initial goal that sounded like this: “Let’s gather in a system all the information of the world!”
According to the Google CEO interviewed, after a decade of global messaging work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What's the job that's best for me?". However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that initiates the search and the pages then viewed by interested people are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, registered program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers to our statements and previous services, and will submit us on the basis of products and services.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against power that can arouse a counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the search terms are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example in recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-minded Internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm in arm with the electronic legal protection body EFF, proved its right to the court in front of the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the points of the constitution will be able to request information on the nature of the FBI to be disclosed.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won over the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. But in the end, it is not able to obtain the lists of private users, nor the full list of these two websites.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against the multinational companies proud of their image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its savages bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the “connected corporation”, as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as the world’s invader, even if they beat the same ones for Windows, and the goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible effect, younger and cooler, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what the Web 2.0, the most promulgated keyword of recent years, pulls right behind it.
Indeed, Web 2.0 concerns nothing but collaboration, but the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young man, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or at last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link these to a system of prosecution, such as F-Feeds or Blip.fm.
While we can get acquainted with many private examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that dismissed one of his employees, only for the honest opinions that he has written on his blog can be the whole thing of life.
One who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how one can define the principle behind the behavior of today's young people.
The one who wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to circumvent Google’s monopoly, can do it (beginning, for example, with Scroogle, using Google’s search engine, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. Google's online services, from text processing to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions having, which are not associated with our profile and are not better served.
The public awaits, without really hiding, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion).AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the turnover of many ad agencies, while other ad-agent programs not only inform more, but the benefits introduced more and more quickly.
However, critical observers find, next to all of this, the company's agreement with all of the government's concerns: for example, the company's top management refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it doubled the price of the company's nursery and after the company has already judged it to be too expensive, the multiple restoration of the company's daily results when it was taken.
According to one of the internal rules of the company, our new services may not be announced until they can be used. What is certain is that in the next few months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines from Google takes such important dimensions as the company will face.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approximated terribly only through Google data.
Two Minors Helped Disappear Traces of <0xC3><0x93>zd's Double Murder
"Police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd. According to substantiated suspicions, they helped to erase the traces of the crime," - said the spokesman of the police station department of Borsod.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they have been accused of. For the moment, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves freely.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old young man from the corner, was placed in custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt and for this reason he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x96>zd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, 9 years old.
According to MTI information, the young man premeditated his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the scenes of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the redemption of 100% of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite, previously, the Czechs excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the proposal of the Poles represents the highest bid ever made for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new least good owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
Based on an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent stake, followed by 14.7 percent of Ceská Sporitelna bank and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the worsening international financial crisis, the leading European press newspapers already evoke a "second 9/11".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the daily of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the emissary goat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system increases every day, and subsequently the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the Congressional vote, a real danger threatens, one that Washington does not propose as a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the void, just at the moment when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer, says the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still lend a lifeline to their hesitating financial organizations, and thanks to taxpayers’ money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominos, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to pay little attention to their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakened financial institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, the Viennese daily Der Standard recalled, adding that fears that European taxpayers too would have to put their hand in the pocket, very deep, similar to Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent on its own.
The "rescuers" should not immediately wave a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing more damage.
The smart car imitates the bourdon flight
What better method would be to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like the bees, for example.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan’s engineers the strategic start-up idea, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini-robot car, a bio-inspired, BR23C-type self-driving system, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, of oval shape, which in reality, looks a lot like our safe protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the brand's research and development and technological public relations department.
The bee's facet eye plays a major role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the facet eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance maneuver is carried out entirely instinctively.
“If it weren’t for this, the mini auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for now the collision is considered unavoidable.
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process should take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference can not go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the endless combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotational movement, the acceleration as well as the slowing as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini auto robot
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentrate is larger, making their lifespan longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, in this way it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
There is no need for memory capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of technology for instant avoidance, which Nissan estimates will be introduced to mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles in his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout plan, aimed at repurchasing dubious credits from banks, and to be used multiple times, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount will be spent.
Reuters reports that in the course of new debates lasting until after midnight on Saturday, local time of the east coast, Congressional leaders have come to an agreement on the controversy that has existed for days and days around the $700 billion bailout plan.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which it remains only to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said, commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however, other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8pm Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2am, according to Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in response to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
Moreover, the program differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent at once, for the repurchase of securities on dubious credits.
From now on, a maximum of half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy dubious claims from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be disbursed to the President.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the Federal Reserve Chairman will also participate.
Spending the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase dubious debts, dubious mortgage and mortgage securities, as well as other types of "toxic" debts.
Departmental officials said the purchases can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools of concern, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast repurchase of dubious debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one or another major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary measures to be ready for the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in bad postures and awaiting state aid can expect their starting allowances, simply called off-Atlantic golden parachute, to be capped by the government.
In addition, the limitations depend on the way the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The ceiling principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys out as part of an auction, they will charge an excess tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Immediately after the repurchase of the dubious debts, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the picture to be complete, it is necessary to add that the existing golden parachutes are not changed. The ceiling applies only to new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal limits will be in place on the appointments of CEOs - commented the chairman of the House Financial Benefits Committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the participating banks, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the rescued banks fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must present to Congress a proposal that will decide on how losses will be refunded to taxpayers, starting with the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why American citizens mandated us, this doesn't protect taxpayer dollars," said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
Her Ohio Democrat counterpart, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who are pressing for action as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices have continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices rose by 0.1 percent from the previous month, and by 12.9 percent from the month of August 2007, according to the Central Statistics Office of Hungary.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to the previous year, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices rose by 0.7 per cent from the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent from the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices have only increased to a lesser extent: by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors have only experienced a slight increase of about 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather goods and footwear sector (2.8 per cent), with firstly, the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of footwear with a 2.5 per cent monthly increase.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials have resulted in significant monthly increases in prices in the chemicals and products manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent) and a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices for paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase, between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, representing a significant weight in domestic industrial operations, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the effect of the rising gas price set by the authorities since July 1.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales of the processing sectors, oil processing sector prices experienced the most significant increase (32.4%).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price decreases occurred in the sectors of textile and textile products production (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacturing of machinery and electrical appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
In the entire processing industry, prices have risen by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors surpassed those of the previous year by 18.7 per cent.
Among domestic trade groups and by sector allocation, in August, the most significant monthly price increases (0.7 per cent) were those that initiated profit on investment.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices have risen by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material-producing sectors for subsequent processing have not changed from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and material production sectors for subsequent processing (16.8 per cent).
In the sectors of consumer goods production, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while for the profit-initiating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
The export prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, rose by 1.1 percent in August from the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national payment method weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar; compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to travel to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that around January 12, the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
“Now, everything depends only on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into service.”
At the same time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in talks starting today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat John McC and Republican John McC.
Barack Obama and McCain Both Support Bank Rescue Plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, backed the government’s $700 billion bailout plan. However, there are politicians demanding the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded agreements in principle on the rescue of banks.
This funding plan, which aims to thaw the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the economic issues highlighted, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead of himself. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colliery just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will swiftly pass the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains consumer protection passages that he also supports.
"It is now that we must act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to call McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We’ll all have a hard time swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible path.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal mentions the establishment of a Treasury Monitoring Commission and the ceiling on senior executive severance allowances, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, president of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press journal of the German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
The Mirror (mirror.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is the same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of epoch is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to happen just ten years ago came to an end: the indisputable hegemony of the national party was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was picking up with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", implemented in the region consistently by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have made a big mistake about the pace. However, the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing region of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical, and more stubborn.
It is also astonishing that in recent weeks it has been the groups of classical citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as freelancers, artisans, holders of the baccalaureate degree and graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on the back of the coalition questions", the conservative Austrian daily newspaper deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that has settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SP<0xC3><0x96> want to discuss with the Conservatives of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The populist party BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
Elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during debates held on public television, party leaders barely let their cards be seen.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question of whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was rejected in any case.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or joining the coalition is for the time being a completely open question, and these points must absolutely be debated within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, is once again open to all proposals.
“To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to take on government responsibilities,” Haider said.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that most affects the lives of successful Roma children and their parents.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened, on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and, on the other, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most eminent representatives of the European legal protection and civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party group, Járóka warned that, in addition to the distinctions found during hiring, Roma disappear from the labour market, primarily because of their low qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school degrees, and as a result of poor-quality elementary education, only a tiny fraction has the opportunity to earn a postgraduate degree."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as an elementary right of the human being plays a key role in asserting other fundamental rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child starts school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid on his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"Because of their European Union citizenship, Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and protected by a low-quality and sectarian education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEPs, the European Union's objective-oriented cooperation and action is necessary to speed up the process of desegregation of schools immediately, for which compliance with existing and in preparation anti-discrimination directives is of the utmost importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and to give the opportunities guaranteed by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" ensured for all, the objective of the Equal Opportunities Summit in Europe held every year since the Berlin Summit last year is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at the level of Member States and target countries at European level.
CSU: the grace for a transitional period
The decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The party’s president, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their seat. The question is how long the grace will last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, made it feel that they did not particularly care for their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the faction and base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the Christian-Social Union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, there is only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still count heavily in this southern region, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates talks with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Co-Electeurs de Valeur de Munich.
A strange leg of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber served as a possibility of a coup perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then treated without care the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now the leaders of the CSU are putting all their energy into stabilizing, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far has been pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bitter remarks to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be chancellor again if they re-establish one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground from the CSU will not negatively influence the great Berlin coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats still persists.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
None of the opposition MPs joined the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegalities committed during the stripping of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature consisting of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants depopulation has been going very well in opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as president for the second time in the second term.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, thus economically dependent on Russia's own gas company, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order called anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the reasons for the Russians to take a contribution from the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates, was a reference to prior easing.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the polling.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the independent months of South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remains the case, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring in even a single opponent".
The opposition does not foresee protests in view of the results, but rather tries to send its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of main concerns from that side: we really need to print our opponents newspapers in Russia, local authorities put sticks in the wheels for us in terms of broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly, as the socially responsible," said Milink.
"Due to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had we had any rotating doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But as of today, this new measure is in force against the little wiles, against whom he points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fatigue novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“The rotating doors are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services,” says Brunetta.
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta added.
The installation in all institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees has been recorded, the secretary-general assures: "This is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7am is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister reports that “‘‘in three months, the sickness absences of public employees have been reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year”.
And he adds that it is essential to make it more effective, the Public Administration .
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - over the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well beyond the inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees have joined forces to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree invoking the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service today outlines data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - writes the Consumers' Association - the people of the "active lazy" continue to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive Public Administration employees gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar disputes the exclusion of additional allowances in case of invalidity due to service; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's stay at home, during which check visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Workplace accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently invalid.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that white deaths were around 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, the National Association of the Mutilated and Invalid Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuous associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of accidented workers, assistance to the families of the victims and public awareness"
"Naturally outraged, everyone has punched the punch to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to keep the focus on this phenomenon, not underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to end it quickly".
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but that does not prevent the number of white deaths from still being impressive," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
“We do not want this ‘discount trend’ to actually translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes, that tragedy occurs.
"We believe that in general, we don't do enough to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"According to us- has emphasized Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are needed, as well as a larger intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added that "there is still an effort to be made in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced the "gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the provision of compensation for victims of work" and the "derivative of assistance towards which the system is oriented in recent years".
“The objective, therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance – he added – so that the fate of the one who has an accident, should not depend on the spontaneity or the enlargement of the legislature.”
Mp3 player pointing fingers, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent damage to hearing.
This is what the European Commission is announcing, citing in a statement released in Brussels the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the EU's newly identified unforeseen health risks (Csserri), published today.
"From this scientific report - we read in the note - it turns out that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable musical devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, are at risk of permanent hearing loss."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones may unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” Kuneva said.
“According to scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to re-examine the existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists-concluded the EU executive-confirm that there is good reason to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against similar noise exposure from portable devices and music devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about the hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit this data well by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the limits currently in force regarding the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods risk a permanent loss of hearing after 5 years.
This affects 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at about 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - he emphasizes - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome that will be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No overlap of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June-announce the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is overwhelmed by the management of everyday life and the emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look forward, and further, to a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will be used to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unified spirit, ".
A future that, the mayor of Rome says, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only from the point of view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and must play, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pretend to be independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “this person is full of ambition.”
“Obama is really cuckolded: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that say little; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the south of the United States wrote an article: Once in the polling booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
Here is an aspect of the American mentality that is kept secret until the end.
“Say what you want, we’ll see ourselves crossing Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, Bush’s weakness.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the United States, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been detained by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly state to information adherents, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on assembling the newspapers, are a major problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as it is heard by the general public is to be reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and print newspaper journalists are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Publication printed against broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are making their way to the Internet, perceived by many as the "killer" of newspaper paper.
The “economic pressure” felt by journalists is increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using technology hoping it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest hangover in American journalism lies between who runs the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level believe that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to "safety at work".
Directors who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we go to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive high salaries, while the editor can earn $10 million a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, a certain number of years passed.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA RESTS IN THE GROTTAFFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had requested to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl climbing investigation.
During his trial last week, he had obtained the house release transformed into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent could travel from the provincial city to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such displacements (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence accusing him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the US economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its eager East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the ones of Washington" and to the world of the South and then to the dancer states of the South.
The soul, precisely, which made itself felt in a despotic way with the vote of which I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is just an example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing or is already letting go: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and it may not be just here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the phenomena that have been lurking for some time, to the point that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the realisation, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of the sovereign state, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that obviously have close relations with the outside world, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation really seems out of the question or it does not have much to say: the obvious evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usual, shared between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide on any common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a love of credit: when you go through a difficult period, it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements of which no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis is, after all, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at one stroke the only thing that our future will have to regulate them.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but that are absolutely related to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign certainly possesses more cards than he who is not, that is, he who is unlucky to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proven inadequate and full of shadow.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even troubling: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus increases even more the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, subterraneanly feeds, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimassions of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which are manifested in the improvised "revolts" electoral or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter all the time, could not be rebuilt by the U.S. conservative movement, from the rise of the Greater Bush, to the Conservative work.
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have ever more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is growing rapidly.
In view of all this, talking about a current “rebellion of the masses” on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But keep your eyes wide open, it’s not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring barely 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep glued a 100 kilogram body on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that allow to ensure the animal, a perfect adhesion.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the paws of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "easily detaches from the wall," says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
“This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” Liming Dai adds.
Could it be to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Maybe it is, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electrical current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superhero.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a microfiber-like adhesive that self-cleanses dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are desalinating and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing according to the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor of health effects at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether they are canned or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm for some patients, reducing their risk, and just a few more.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized because it has been held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs, to toxic levels.
It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mixture and to be careful what one drinks, if one takes medicines such as Diazépam or Mézépam.
According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medications, such as:
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: "These findings are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies, who will need to change the information notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines you take, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," said the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration’s greatest critics of economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked many controversies, and which was blamed to the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the Enron or Worldcom collapse disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a “very aggressive” divulger, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to touch ever more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following nearly a year of ISO work by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the revised and become less austere interface, to other more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the latest version, the standard Mac OS support and the new OS format.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some module-specific features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphics development module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphic with elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration between multiple people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the drafting of texts, because each contributor is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of freelancing can be a way to spread it in the homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office later tries the big challenge, already relying on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and support service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word equivalent video writing; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Goal for 2008, reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, you can even exceed the expected number
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccco and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests performed on Kohl samples are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to wait two years for elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity to the third generation EPO, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, picking up the best climber's pea jersey.
IMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES Is ITALY RACIST?
Italy, “as a country of migrants, has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants” welcomed with reluctance.
That would turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is interested in dedicating a long article debating the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, native of Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "North paradox": the Nordic regions are both those where there is "more integration and more work", but also "a strong anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Lega Nord".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the intolerance episodes of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestine people is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, called for the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism.
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the tenants’ union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin must support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand from the general process of deforming the market has so much
In most cases, rental offers also include a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no rental limit, sub-rentals.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the tax, are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Black Strip area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), it is asked about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for the areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, we spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by non-community students, there is a further anomaly: the rent requested by foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities elect the historic halls.
Historic cinemas are closing in favor of multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth of large multi-rooms, and the death of consumption of mono-rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historical places and full of memory, "it's as if one of my friends was disappearing, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of the way and so many emotions" observes the director of the New Paradiso cinema, film that offers Tornatore the first 20 years ago, and the first Os
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: over the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the halls of the main cities that have paid the most: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is at the top with 82 cinemas mono halls lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first cause of their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still have to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room is closed in a city, these attendees are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation on credit for merchants: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to solve the situation thanks to the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono halls of historical centers and on the periphery.
The proposed regulations include tax incentives for managers and mobility benefits for the public: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking spaces and in certain parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
However, it is obvious that, to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me, has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema de Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Cinema Paradiso" which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much shared emotions, I turn to the other side so as not to see the signs blackened by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to unify the choices of the City Hall with the interests of the Piromalli clan.”
The magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria have launched serious charges against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his young son lawyer, named after the boss, already convicted of association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to enter officially within the town halls facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, of control and orientation of the public administration"
The chairman of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "colloquiums between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a centre-right coalition, following the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of handling everything for a political issue, but given the incarceration request signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from orderly interceptions against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, emerged "the readiness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from waves, now the big ones are launched.
This is an oversized deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which giants like Chevron have set their eyes, and are now trying to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, at the same time as the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a big boost to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore wave operating systems.
That would be twice as much as nuclear power plants produce.
And in addition, there would be the currents and tides..
Colossians at the attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been a real revolutionary step.
Two years on, more and more candidates among these companies dedicated to traditional energy have always been relying on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a U.S. oil giant company told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that it is precisely in Alaska that the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for further excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the energy path from the sea, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are not known, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, apart from the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears of environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the sludge up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
At the moment, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Green Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a mall and parking lot using six marine turbines from the East River in New York.
The movement of the water during the tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that it has a long list of customers awaiting the necessary permissions to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves at this time, the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coasts, have invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and foreseen investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
