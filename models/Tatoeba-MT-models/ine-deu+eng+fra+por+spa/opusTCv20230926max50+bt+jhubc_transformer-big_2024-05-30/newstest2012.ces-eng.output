Parliament does not support the novelty liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal, as part of the amendment to the criminal code, the paragraph on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted.
The amendment, which would pave the way for the release of the detainee, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the proposal to mitigate penalties for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly disadvantageous contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the appeal of the convicted is to be discussed by the court in December.
Tymoshenko describes the verdict as a political vengeance of the regime, suspicion of bias in the court has triggered the process in the West as well.
The proposal to remove section 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the former prime minister was convicted, supported 147 MPs in the vote.
It required 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan defeat
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its defeats.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
It remains to define the winner.
As is the custom in the region, the Islamists will win the elections, but the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to the customary law of Sharia and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because stealing cuts the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith are waiting for execution and so on.
In place of the person of a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly would not want.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans just mentioned for change.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic fighters took the blame from unbelieving dogs.
The only regret is that, from their point of view, the NATO raids were not directed by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified at every intervention.
If the West is looking for a winner in Libya, then the West is not one of them.
We took part in the shooting, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the political ally in the person of the dictator, without guaranteeing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
In this case, the problem with the expulsion of "crusaders" is eliminated locally.
But will they have Libyan black gold as a mouthpiece without the occupation of the oil company?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the unselfish protection of human rights.
Unless, of course, the Sharia law is passed on to us.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe get into the search for investors
Statistical shrinkage swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published GDP data for the 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated inter-quarterly, and Germany and France are growing.
The bond market is breaking records today.
Investors no longer look only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and more.
The Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was next to better than expected (up 0.3% over the original 0.1%), while France said it appeared in a slight decline of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, the quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated, confirming the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic performance growth.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated between quarters.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2% year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish bonds are rising to critical limits.
The problems are beginning to be felt by Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Revenues on Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are rumors in Germany that the ECB should be the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
Montenegro wins 1:0 and celebrates the 200 million mark
The football team has managed the hardest task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to a great Czech and a beautiful goal, Petra Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a big portion of luck in the second half, defended a luxurious advantage from home retaliation and will not be missing again at the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the progress match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to the home loss in the finish, the great Czech and the hero Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, has successfully won 1–0 in Montenegro and is celebrating progress at the European Championships.
The Montenegrins did not get into pressure until the second half due to the precise defense of the Czech whole.
Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D> were the scorers of the match, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Peter <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championships next year, and the cashier of domestic football will receive a reward of about 200 million crowns.
A lot of football has been played since the first few minutes.
Both teams had difficulty getting involved in the combination and played mostly around the half-line.
The pressure of the domestic footballers did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense accurately deflected the long knockouts for the defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the facility on Tuesday afternoon and then provoked the deaths of the US and Israel.
Several hundred students from universities in Iran's Isfahan created a live shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, which processes uranium.
They are thus showing that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran had not stopped pursuing nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities has been reported in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then provoked the deaths of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at paralysing Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, the target would be a facility in Natanz where uranium is enriched, in addition to the Isfahan center.
Dietary of an obese child: breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with being overweight, with overweight being 9 percent of schoolchildren and obese being 5 percent of children.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to a recent study.
Once again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the environment in which a person grows and the patterns that surround him.
For example, on tables in obese children, bruises appear up to half more often than in families of children with normal weight.
Fried fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with the outreach event called Obesity is no coincidence more than 19 percent of obese.
In obese families, too, it is not customary to do sports, which, of course, affects most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children responded that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last year’s school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesity Not a coincidence event, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 students from the 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
Proper eating and enough exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes the dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
“Only half of those surveyed, for example, said they ate breakfast-breakfast-lunch-dinner-dinner five times a day, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper nutrition,” the study said.
Without breakfast and evening steak
Experts point out that for healthy development, both relative details are essential, including, for example, the regular time of family breakfasts.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
And the worst part was finding out that in a tenth of households, they don’t eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly exercise, the result for their parents was less than half - 15 percent.
Build your own meal plan
Another part of the survey allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own meal plan according to their own taste and opinion.
"The nutritional preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of floury, meaty and sweet dishes.
"The alarming popularity of sweet lemonade is particularly high," the study's final report said.
At lunchtime, pasta was the main dish just above the poultry.
But the children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetables is low.
Propensity for health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"The control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the obesity education lecture was not a coincidence, in a number of cases, there was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy eating," the project's results say.
For example, in the case of sweet lemonades, more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children also checked poultry and fish as the main meal of the day much more often in the questionnaire, and would restrict sweet foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I complained so little that there was a lot already in the introductory hours.
I didn't know what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three professionals from the field, dressing up problematic figures and a seminar on how it goes on the court.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "trodden".
This time, Director Alenka and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
These are the overwhelming majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight again.
The stylist needs to know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We received both tips for women like Jennifer Lopez, that is, larger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, to emphasize the figure nicely and at the same time not to dress the woman too challenging.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirts or trousers do not really fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece tailored.
You will certainly not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothing is priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailored skirt than in one that constantly moves, wraps, stays in your waist and so on.
In turn, the boy's character can afford to wear clothes with a bandage, applications, embroidery or recruitment.
Of course, there are a lot of such information and character types, so I’m glad I have a whole week to get all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that due to the assigned homework, it's all up.
Each of the students has been assigned a celebrity to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the given personality and the type of character.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my opinion, it’s definitely better for me than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained perhaps a hundred pounds (please take into account the excess), or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out the clothes from magazines or search the Internet and print them and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will then also express our personal style and relationship to the graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphical side of styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses physically, but also creates so-called product pages in magazines (for specific tasks, for example, trends of handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told to us by stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
The Saturday lecture, loaded with information about the types of characters, was immediately spoiled by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, such a trenchcoat (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a t-shirt as a cloak, but you can also wear it on a bare body, boots and photograph as a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves or collar and the whole look looks different right away.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "To work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start breaking them," Jacob said.
Finally, I understand why we break down all the lessons, what to combine with, why, when we see something different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have prepared much more variations of clothing than how many can be photographed.
So for a fashion story, which will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set up" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo the clothes look and work in combination with other pieces of leckdy completely different than in reality.
This is what we need to consider when creating an outfit.
That image and style make up half the success, Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> confirmed to us.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it is enough that I know something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone already has to create a styling from us, then we have to count on the fact that it is very likely to dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than it really has.
Then all that remains is to google and find out if the boulevard hasn’t written about the celebrity being muted/lost weight and so on.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario told us that it was not enough for a stylist to orient himself in fashion and be able to fold outfits.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he wears, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to encourage oneself, to stand behind one's opinion.
“When a manager orders you to sort out her closet and add nice pieces, you can’t throw the whole closet away and say, ‘God, that’s horrible.’”
“Find at least a few things that you’ll praise and recommend what to wear,” Mario says.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "plate", or bag for the square.
It is the one that you turn around your waist and you have all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, hair rollers or locking pins, there is also a silicone thread (with which the stylist helps to photograph products such as bags or hats), special clips with which we clip the back of the clothes, if it is larger (pins or other clamps).
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to water the shoes correctly.
Even when photographed in a studio where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, especially outside.
So we glued and glued.
We must not even touch the shoes with scissors, so that they do not accidentally damage.
Real skill is needed, then.
Mario was delighted when my creation praised unreservedly.
This skill isn’t really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course continuation.
It’s becoming increasingly clear to me that doing styling on a professional level isn’t really a walk in a pink set, no matter who wants what they want.
Need for Speed: The Run takes place across the Americas.
Review(s)
Originally, a carefree ride is transformed into a routine morning walk due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
Although the ambition has largely been fulfilled, it is not valid if no one clearly wanted to do anything extra.
A new episode titled The Run aroused high expectations before it was released.
He promised that the year-old racing series Need for Speed would once again move a bit in a new direction and from playable demonstrations it appeared as a game that in the genre of action racing would not have to be just in numbers.
We were also curious how the embedded passages, in which the main hero gets out of the car and runs on his own.
As usual with the NFS series, however, many things are a little different from what we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole thing pulls down a few unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing in the series for more than a few years.
So it’s not really a mistake, but rather an expression of some incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to the story whose main hero Jack has certain problems of a personal nature and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will be driving on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to be the first to arrive in New York.
The idea carries with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race runs on a different track and the given stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t even feel like the game is always the same.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing world-famous.
But driving through the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains seems visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are occasionally plastered with some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught up in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you need to be careful not to get overwhelmed by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are quite well-developed.
There are only a few types, but that’s enough.
For a while you try to overcome the required number of opponents (essentially a classic race), then again you reach the time (classical match with the bars) and then there is a duel with a single opponent waiting for you.
From time to time, the police will also be involved, which further upsets your efforts.
The novelty is the passages outside the car.
Rather, it’s just such an interactive animation, where Jack usually runs in front of someone and you have to help him with it by pressing the right buttons at the right times.
It's nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, however, these passages are much less in the game than you would expect (in particular, maybe only three).
As a result, however, it is for the benefit of the thing, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of the above, it belongs to the elements that diversify the game.
The riding model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that nowadays it is definitely no longer who knows, but it cannot be said to be a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more action-packed racing model here still fits quite well, even though we could find a better one in the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the car model, it is no longer a collision model.
From a game of this type, we do not expect it to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how your car will behave before any impact on any object, then probably not everything is completely fine.
Typically, when you’re just overtaking or switching cars in normal traffic, sometimes you just lick each other slightly, but sometimes in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even a direct attack.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t matter, but it will detune you reliably.
Restarts are solved in such a way that if you crash or go far off track, the game will throw you back to the last catch point on the track.
There are only five restarts available in each race.
When you have exhausted them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it’s more like a help in case something doesn’t work out than you could rely on them explicitly.
But sometimes even restarts do not help, they only solve the need to learn a certain section of the race memory.
The big problem with the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some bends, for example, need to pass in a specific way, otherwise you simply won’t fit in.
At other times, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially aggravating in situations where you see the opponent passing easily in front of you between two opposing cars, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass or brake them.
It does not matter when you reach them, because it is "calculated" so that the given situation always occurs right in front of your nose.
Opponents have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you will encounter several places where, again, regardless of the time, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
It hits most at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to get there in front of you apparently at any cost.
When he drives in front of you, it worsens your visibility of the counter-going cars, so at the beginning you spread out there a few times.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-filled, but the execution is so obvious that it reliably disgusts you quickly.
And it's a pity, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and places are so action-packed that sometimes you literally don't tend to watch where everything flies.
And it doesn’t really matter whether it’s a concept with fifty unique tracks, a race schedule so that boredom doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to exchange cars during races.
You have to be careful of gas stations on the roads, because that’s where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you’ll be satisfied with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports bikes are suitable for urban areas, strong American storms on straight highways and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example on rolling mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with both the challenge modes, which are the races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and stories.
To gain a higher level of the driver, various items are unlocked: starting with the car and ending with the background for the profile.
At the same time, it is also linked to the online Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and provides additional community features.
One of the other hard to understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (either), where you take it in the dark along the tracks (either).
On the tachometer, the numbers flash between 150 and 200 km/h (because) and a set of subway stops at the back and uncompromisingly knocks you down.
In the editorial office, we will have a discussion for a few more days about whether no one really thought about it when creating the game, or whether the authors consider us to be such a big asshole.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in a few cases even great.
It is unfortunate that in some of the more exhausting moments, the shooting decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
But this is especially true for a drill with a larger number of participants, when smooth shooting would no longer be valid for you.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, the soundtrack was created from the category "every dog is different", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, no one will buy the game.
Need for Speed: The Run is a bit of a mess.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best NFS game in the last few years.
This is how the game is unfinished.
Fun is certainly fine, but be prepared for the fact that mistakes will tear you in the eye with the power of airport spotlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation as negativists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has severely disrupted the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down, calm down and all players get used to their new roles," Milena Vicenová, Czech Ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
To what extent she takes her motto "Intelligently and openly about Europe" seriously, she has already shown it in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that she could be lectured by a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the UK envy.
Vicen also commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was a criticism that he was insignificant, that he was a grey official, that he couldn't play any role, and I have to say that everyone was breathtaking, that he did the role very well."
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?", that is, as a significant step towards unification and greater legibility of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban cheese.
Vicenova has also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency called it a success.
The Czechs have dealt with the impending financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was a great negative, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
Speaking in the words of the ambassador, "the fact frmol" was not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is still being addressed today.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is becoming much more complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slim and economical, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which will be less, all this is on the agenda for the next negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "On Europe understandably".
“I really don’t like ugly shortcuts, strange words, a gimmick that no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that there are really no curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of different sizes, or that we really need to be banned from cheese?"
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and bring more Czechs into European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people who pay attention to the negative rather than the positive side of things.
In addition, it regrets the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors to blame, for example, the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Hey, what are you meeting there, what is your Visegrad Four?'
In the future, according to Vicente, the Union will mainly have new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
He sees the concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe as very real, rather than a new “European federation.”
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t want to stand far away.”
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the Union should be discussed between all Member States, not only between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM Innovator Begins Second Century
If someone were to look for a word that would most accurately express IBM’s strategy, the closest one would probably be “longevity.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation for this long-term development was laid by the company’s first chief executive, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the motto that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second century," said Samuel J. Palmisano, current CEO of the company.
Elaborated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached caring for his employees in a similar way to Bata’s businessman in the Czech Republic – as one of the first U.S. employees, IBM had paid vacation, employer insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system to reward the best employees.
IBM has a long-term relationship with its customers.
The company has been brilliant at mining talent from the start – as one of the world’s first companies, it eliminated any discrimination so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, headed by IBM, will be replaced next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been at IBM for 30 years and still holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called pits, online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder there are enough ideas – almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A strong position in the business is ensured by the firm’s strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a tech company," Harvard Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter told the Economist.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems through the use of technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM – or “Great Blue,” as it is familiarly called because of its logo in the United States – has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is probably the most versatile technology company – it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds the most patents of all U.S. tech companies, and five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy disk.
With roughly $220 billion, IBM has become the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (the first being Apple) when it first surpassed Microsoft since 1996.
A look ahead
Not all products and innovations have met the taste of customers and time - for example, IBM has failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t emotionally tie yourself to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them.
Unlike, for example, the competitive Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM has the largest share of services, with about one-fifth of them made up of software and hardware.
In 1990, with more than half of the share, it was the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold few profitable assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time investing $58 billion in the acquisition of promising technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis overtook the world for the first time.
IBM is acting according to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis unaffected.
The price of IBM shares has risen by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, the company's net profit is constantly growing.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything but not its values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM's History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally under the complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM did not take over until 1924 - it was originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
IBM was founded on the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous "squirrels," i.e. clocks recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of a rival company, to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founders of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name implies, began manufacturing and selling all kinds of business machines – from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, revenue doubled to $9 million, and the company’s extensive expansion into all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost forty years in the chief's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, humans and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space – to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous man’s flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The classic "slice" that set the computer standard at the time, called IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to Chinese company Lenovo, bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and began to devote itself fully to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make smart use of technology in unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example in transport or city administration.
For the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform, which helps merchants manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central Office for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
The Judge of the Unfaithful Husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now he does not intend to wait and has set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner anymore," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová granted asylum to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>a in her home in the summer, she apparently did not even dream of how her marriage would end.
Although Iveta moved out of <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>an after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not abandon the singer.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, reconciled with her husband’s relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
The rich man doesn’t care who his wife sleeps with.
After all, if the judge and Barto<0xC5><0xA1>a broke up only once, his wife’s open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will drive him out."
"But he will experience it not as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," said Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová, saying that she had already detached herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't care that Darina closed his back door.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, shopping."
"Darina and I have a normal conversation, except that we don't share beds together," the judge told Lightning.
If the judge also finds a new love, he will not stop her from doing so.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, who she goes with, and if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility," Josef concluded.
Women’s Worst Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men if they would be able to list any typical female bad habits, as a rule, all in one is very promptly spilled out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are several female bad habits that can perfectly pump blood into men's veins?
Shopping <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one handkerchief a week?
Do you like to shop and mass in discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their shopping passion a little bit.
But say, who would resist just going through clothing stores, looking for well-fitting tops and then trying them all (ideally in different colours) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell of a lot for men.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you in front of the door...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't that right?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop caring for yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite circle.
Wash the windows, vacuum, wipe the tiles, wipe the dust, rub the bathtub - at least twice a week.
Are you blaming your partner for stepping on a clean tile with a dirty foot, your children for dirtying a scratched washbasin and covering a glazed wall of your living room that you've put so much work into polishing?
If you are suffering from this "distortion", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not be placed within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can jeopardize your relationships and family well-being.
Scratch
"Throw your used trainers in the basket."
"Will you wear your old socks tomorrow, too?"
"The wet cloth doesn't belong on the ground."
If you rub your partner this way several times a day, know that you can reliably rub him.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, you want to make sure everything is okay.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to dig into them that much.
Blasphemy, slander
For some women, there are also slander, gossip, but also insults and association against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why together.
Maybe each of us will throw some little harmless gossip or slander in there.
Hands on the heart, it's all women's.
On the contrary, the crumbs of the coarsest grain, which they like and often crumble, perhaps everyone despises and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the women's work collective.
Jagr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with assists to win Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jagr took part in the NHL match on Monday with two assists to the victory of Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina Ice and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the review of the thirty-nine-year-old star, who added one more innings and was declared the best player of the match.
Jagr’s team-mate Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the match.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Giroux.
"Before the game, I told him he was going to have a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," Jagr explained, after which Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
A little later, the second strike of the team had a Czech footprint.
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek fought the disc behind the goal of Hurricanes and put it between the circles scoring Maxim Talbot.
In the second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer reduced in weakness, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
After working with Jagre, he scored a third goal, after which his shot was overthrown by Wayne Simmonds in fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely in the top three,” Jagr said.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him."
"I'm glad of it."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL my teammates have tried to play for me, now it's turning around," Jagr added.
Carolina still made the game a drama, with Tuoma Ruutu's goal and again Dwyer, who made it out of the penalty shootout, got the difference of one goal.
Matt Read, who finished the two-to-one renumbering, did not allow another complication.
"Great hit in our Pronger band."
"He blew out the disc, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to the farther rod."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference in the first round.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not play the match against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned due to an injury in the upper body.
In addition to the experienced beck, the Candiens also lost the two-sided lead and lost after a penalty shootout of 2:3.
One of their raids was not changed by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
Rather than losing points, the home coach was repulsed by the large back row, with only five defenders finishing the match.
"It's bad."
"We only played with one experienced player, the rest were youngsters."
"But there is nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"It's been rolling on us alternately, and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, pushed the regiment out of our belt."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg strikes to a 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted the five-game series of losses, were shared by five different shooters.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc in the vast majority, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled on holiday to the DDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea by the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when there was also the possibility of traveling to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the travels of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the era of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually, even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand a queue overnight with a sleeping bag or to have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
However, it was not won either.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a prerequisite for travel to the West, was not given to “politically unreliable people” who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it was not possible to obtain funds (western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange promise.
By far the most often, however, the Czechs spent holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs bought and this custom survives to this day.
Traveling Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our peak, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we do not realize today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the most popular Croatia today until 1989, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Immediately at the end of the 1990s, the visa requirement for neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits, mainly to Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czechs slept in parks and tents because our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of the Czechs' travel was at this time driving their own food, cans, salami, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally freely buy the Western currency after many decades.
However, our standard of living and, with it, our average wages have risen, leading to another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to regularly prepare for charter flights since 1997, making air travel incredibly cheaper than in the past due to the possibility of contracting quantitative discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free access to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the United States, which continued to make our travels easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the Czech Republic was historically the first direct charter flight to exoticism, it was to Thailand.
From this year onwards, Czech tourists fly direct charters to warm distant countries every year, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States revoked the visa for Czech tourists and thus our country was finally ranked among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in history (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than CZK 15 thousand per person on one foreign holiday, including the cost of residence.
The General Assembly is to find the president, but again the threat of
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a president and there is a threat that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka, head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known even after the next extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement as to which electoral procedure will be followed.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Interested in leading Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June and, upon his departure, urged colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the era after the Hague, football slipped back to the footsteps between the two union chambers, which could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully revealed on September 16, when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly gathered in the National House in Prague at Smíchov in vain, because the meeting was blocked and it was not just about the way of choice.
There was also no agreement as to who actually has the right to vote in the assembly - whether only statutory representatives or officials with full powers of attorney.
At this single point, a partial agreement has been reached since then, to which the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible, has also helped.
There is still controversy over the electoral system.
Neither has the executive committee made it too clear, which, in its proceedings, whether regular or extraordinary, essentially does not deal with anything else.
The view on the option has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to act in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model, in the third round, one of the candidates who will have a higher percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Morava is reportedly willing to go for a concession to win a candidate who will get a higher percentage of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the advantage in this percentage.
"But then it would lose the meaning of the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," understands the objections of the Moravian Svoboda party, according to which the best order would be to not bend and vote according to the current statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also agrees with this, although it is estimated that the electoral order determined by the statutes suits Pelt most of all the candidates.
"I would like to have the maximum number of votes in accordance with the statutes."
"Not to invent some representative nonsense like the last general meeting," said owner Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his statements defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be known in Nymburk and believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All the passions will calm down the possible progress of today's national team at the European Championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to work together," says the Jablonecski official, who has the largest experience in football management both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I'm hoping for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very fragmented."
"It is not between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations purposefully."
"This could cause the general assembly to be blocked again."
"But I hope common sense wins," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some of the talks were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete in the match.
The flight special, in which the Vice-Chairmen Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorica, among others, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical fault, and was looking for a replacement option for transporting part of the executive committee to the scene of the barrage retaliation.
Eventually, there may be a decisive meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1> would like to force the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and a general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV is also about to be held, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paklik goes to battle for the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the head of Pilsen footballers Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík before the extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate who would fulfill all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even have entered the fight for a top position.
“If there was a good adept, I would fight for him and not go to the polls.”
"But in the current situation, no one has been found," said Paclík.
In a fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Paclík is motivated to try to avoid Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, in his way to the head of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Paclik also stresses that in the event of his victory, he would only last in the role of President until 2013, when the regular General Assembly is on the agenda.
In his position, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too attached to the football story.
"I've been talking to some people who might have come into consideration."
"It was crazy for me when some people said that at this point they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that view," he said.
Paclík is now most troubled by Pelto’s association with the president of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík, it is so unacceptable for Pelta to take the presidency.
"If he wins, the current state is preserved and nothing in football will move forward."
"Combined with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled trader, it would not benefit football any more," Paclík said.
He also points out that Pelt’s name was heard years ago in the aftermath of a corruption investigation, but Pelt came out of it with impunity.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who also takes his former statement to heart that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became president".
But if Paclík triumphed in Thursday’s election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelt.
Another candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by Paclík before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, is also considering the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the team."
"But managerially, he wouldn't be able to run the association."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who in September drew a lot of attention by standing behind the dismissal of a panel of arbitrators headed by Lu<0xC4><0x91>ek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paklik says he would dare to lead the association.
He relies on his ability to manage private companies, since last summer he has also headed Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated the Premier League triumph in May.
“I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to its cultivation.”
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeals commission, which deals with unpleasant situations," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan chief Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etínsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of his priorities would also be to strengthen FA<0xC4><0x8C>R’s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things that the new president should be doing."
"If there is a taxation of gambling, as political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they have to say where the money will go," he said.
As a burden now Paclík does not even take his connection with the Pilsen club, although he himself claims that the president of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "translateral".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see any point in transferring my shares in the Pilsen club to someone hypocritically and in a year and a half he would return there," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would exclude the electoral heel
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for president Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would have new statutes that would permanently rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic ahead of Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly mitigate the football team’s potential success today.
Pelta had already promised before the September election that he would focus on representation and obtaining finances in the event of an election.
He decided to go to the last-minute election before the last general meeting, so he could use a two-month delay to defend his ideas about football management and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for someone to lead the association," says a man who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who has served for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the union.
That is why he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with choice is the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>k.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they did not admit different interpretations, we had a president since September," Pelta said.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civil association that he took as a reminder to delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta says.
It is said that he is not trying to limit himself against his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Henry Reichl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knew well that his counter-candidate would be his first vice-chairman.
He did not attack Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík for a long time, who, on the contrary, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year, he's already had some successes."
"His attacks were unworthy, however, and many people were surprised in the way of the election campaign."
"That's why many of them are now questioning his true character," Pelt told the opponent, who is said to remain faithful to the proclamation he announced in September.
According to him, his most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
This should be a football booth.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemians or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately after that, I would go to talks with the private and public sectors to secure enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any personnel cleansing.
"I should first get acquainted with the filling of individual employees," he said to Strahov, where there is a understandable nervousness over the long run.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming general meeting, he believes delegates will not go to Nymburk in vain on Thursday.
"If the only point of dispute is how he will be elected in the third round, then we can move on."
"Football needs credibility, and here it will only be gained by finally having its leader again," Pelta said in a statement, two days before the crucial day of his career.
Rajchl promises that under him FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working hard
If the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic was elected to the general meeting on Thursday, the current vice-president Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if elected, he will start working hard.
It wants to enforce systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by former president Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national teams, professional football, performance football to youth football."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything by myself," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and I want to allocate competencies on the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a specific area."
"And I'm going to give hard tasks to push football a mile forward in each of these segments."
“A lot of people wouldn’t be happy about it, because it would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks under my feet and question every step of my life," he explained.
"But a lot of people told me not to give up, because then others would give up."
"It's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with The Hague.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"Processes are underway that will have a resonance in a few years' time, and I don't want anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that in the event of the election of another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation on the union could return to the time before The Hague.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something that I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
“It’s mostly about people who play football in a way that is only for the chosen ones.”
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for putting someone aside."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the elected ones," said Rajchl.
He also dismissed the claim that he was only a Czech president.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be a current situation where only three Moravian teams are in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," said Rajchl.
Since the head of the Pilsen club Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also took part in the fight for the president, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that there are clear achievements behind me," said Rajchl, who considers his achievements to be saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, arranging television contracts and negotiating the law.
On the contrary, he takes for an accomplice the fact that the bundle does not pull behind a single rope.
While he claims that he is "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", Paclík considers the second of his opponents a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If elected, perhaps he would continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to do it for himself," rivals Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
Julia Stanek
Snorkeling from the view of Ufona, a luxurious swimming pool in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue wonder – and after a city tour or a trip let his tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show you where the wellness by the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a voyage of discovery in the past year and a half, her suitcase should not be missing: her swimsuits.
Laying a hint on the water, looking up to the height of the artistically shaped domes, swimming in front of the marble screed (buildings of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)), waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admiring carefully restored Art Nouveau floats.
If she liked a float, she took it to her notebook in an instant - even with remarkable details about how the building was built and its history.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and are now presented in her newly published book "Badefreuden": People's Swimming Pools in Munich, Historic Palace of Swimming Pools in the Black Forest, "The Hard Core of Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her by her "Travel to the most unusual spas in Central Europe": next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
With sport, it doesn’t go too far, says Meder – it’s just something else in the water.
The only thing to be angry about is that fans of swimming have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can breathe in the breathtaking scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful roar of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice floats."
Water level doubles the architecture
Splashing in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real pasture for the eyes: "In place of the floor, a person has a water level in the baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically duplicated: high gap, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historic wellnes oases on 190 pages - but above all it arouses the desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by Mrs. Meder, a collector of the floats, during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, she found water containing nitrates in the original karst cave (cave spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal spas, the pools of which are filled with alkaline water (they are filled with alkaline water).
Many heated swimming pools under the open sky in Switzerland and Austria offer a splendid view on the other hand. While you can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, you can look at the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton, which is covered with snow.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a ufo that just landed in the Alps.
Out of the three open pools up in winter, steam rises as it rises to the sky behind the <0xC3><0x96>tztal Mountains.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
It wasn't in every swimming pool that Mrs. Meder's pool collector had the smell of chlorine in her whiskers.
Many thermal spas are smelling of sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád spas in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells of heating oil to the point that one can hardly believe that he got into the therapeutic spas.
The smell comes from the healing water containing alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and the sediments of which lurk on the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a somewhat strange wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luha<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she stumbled upon the enclosed ground.
In 1902, the baths designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovi<0xC4><0x8D> were closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked through the decaying windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds growing in the tiles.
In contrast, the extinction occurred at the magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas already have three phases of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanesque elements that date from the time of its creation in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was annexed around 1900.
Since its meticulous renovation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite spa of pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because it comes from the Black Forest.
"It's a kind of performance to combine so many different building styles into such a beautiful complex," says Ms. Meder.
For such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to review trade in commodities
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank leaving its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the head of the company wants to infer the consequences.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For federal citizens, the thing is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions step out of this trade because it deepens the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges pushes prices upwards and banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is targeted specifically against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley do the same.
Initially, commodity bets were designed to protect traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that participants in the capital market with an interest in high-risk trades have detached themselves from supply and demand – and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism: he promised to check the rumors and said that no trade "is worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at stake."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group controls the news from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is due to close by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - along with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank’s officials want to tell what the consequences are.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
Thilo Bode, the head of Foodwatch, welcomed the report, but at the same time reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: “Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks are hurting the general well-being today.”
Let Ackermann, as the supreme bank lobbyist, live up to his duties.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items where money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr. Ackermann is talking about the starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s outlook seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board of directors would not join the supervisory board as planned.
By turning away from the disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - he should eventually consult his successor.
Anyone else would have to pay for the raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the manager under high pressure.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which 1001 people were interviewed by the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November.
Only eleven percent believe it is legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are linked to food prices.
Many banks’ customers would also draw personal consequences if they found out that their bank is involved in such transactions: One in two would, as a result of the survey, denounce all investments where money is leaked into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn the known of such a bank, 49 percent said they would consider terminating their account and move to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: The Austrian pavilion at the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
It is now reopened as an exhibition hall.
When it burns for modern post-war architecture, for bright shapes, glass halls, bold breakthroughs and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is a decent and famous tribute to
Schwanzer’s pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its lightweight and breathtaking steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He famously built an Austrian pavilion for the next world exhibitions.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW-Palace plus as a key to the Munich side building, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, a pavilion designed after the world exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), renovated and opened the Museum of the 20th century in 1962 - it was named as the "House of the 20th Century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until the present arts had a new stall in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been chattering more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a distinguished career, i.e. a skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating skating
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and bookstore should be created, and an office building should be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation for execution.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he studied at Schwanzer’s Technical University in Vienna and the pavilion was an “extremely important place” for him.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost to its generosity and lightness during its relocation to Vienna and change of use.
In the current reconstruction, there were far greater problems: the building was a “catapult for energy,” says Krischanitz.
The windows profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulation glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridge-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a crowded lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown color tone.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the memorial office and a low budget.
"Often material had to be found that is good and inexpensive and also liked by the memorial office," Krischanitz says, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was hard to say with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such an architecture is said to be “always in the wrong place” and still wants to “build proper self-confidence”.
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because a happy urban accident happened: In the district around the Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City Quarter near the Main Station" with office and residential houses is created.
And perhaps there will be another lucky coincidence: the house of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as they say, it is already talking with the city about a neighborhood on a site in the Schweizer Garten.
The railway is planning a package for the winter crisis in the amount of millions
The track has laid out a crisis plan to prevent trains from falling out in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against the cold caused by train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year, according to a report in the newspaper.
The newspaper "Bild" reported preliminaryly with reference to the internal group plan, which is expected to total investments of around 300 million euros by 2015.
It aims to improve the use of trains and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees per 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The aim is to get rid of the platform before the start of operation and 90 percent for the necessary rollovers within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, rail chief Rüdiger Grube warned of train failures and delays during this winter after meeting at the highest level with government and industry officials.
In the last winter, the railroad experienced significant problems in passenger transport because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions, it had a shortage of reserves.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition, there is a delay in reporting ICE trains
The track has also been unable to handle the fact that ICE axes must be checked more frequently by workshops when one ICE train at Cologne Central Station destroyed the axle.
Deutsche Bank is fined a million dollars in the United States
After a start around boss Josef Ackermann, new trampolines are taking place in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank hadn’t had enough problems at home, a giant in the industry still has its past in the U.S.: The Frankfurt institution pays $145 million (106 million euros) in one settlement procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage bonds.
NCUA’s financial market regulator blames a number of large banks for misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost much of their value during the crisis and plunged the banks into the abyss with them.
“We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said.
The bank does not admit guilt by settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the hospitality of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and assists in bankruptcies to protect customer receivables.
The NCUA is seeking compensation for billions of dollars in damages.
Now completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clung to other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Dubious mortgage securities are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it became destiny for a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events occurred a few years ago, there is now a sharp wind blowing in the face of the banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to remedy or affect the error.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
He blamed 18 major international banks for having disadvantaged two U.S. state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in a $200 billion mortgage deal.
Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA lawsuit, which involves multiple transactions worth a total of around $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be liable for "substantial losses" without, of course, specifying any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett to join IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
Warren Buffett has always said that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies is difficult to predict.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Much earlier, he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the IT department of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment is considered a fit for knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, the IT rock can now be called "Sir IBM".
In March, Buffett told CNBC that he had bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said IBM hadn’t even heard of his involvement.
He praised the management, which even sought proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long been investing in lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old pioneer of computers also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has avoided tech firms to this day.
They claim that they are investing only in companies whose activities they also understand.
Instead, Buffett reached out to the freight railroad, the lubricant manufacturer or the machine manufacturer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns, in addition to some 80 own subsidiaries, also shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old took over a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, and built one of the most valuable companies in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha (The Miracle of Omaha).
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM stocks rose by one percent before the stock market began.
The "Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total stock price of more than $220 billion and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, the world's most valuable tech companies.
At Microsoft, so much for Buffett, he wouldn’t want to appear.
Bill Gates is said to be his closest friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the discovery of "The Cells in Zwickau", the Turkish media questioned the German rule of law.
The newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now revived.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish descent and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a far-right background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, this report was responded with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, this brings back a ghost that has long been considered dead: since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been doubted.
The far-right extremist network, however, reveals a scope whose dimension has long since been unseen.
"Is the bloody ideology revived?" were the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, stressed that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the protection of the constitution and feared that the German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany has reacted judiciously: It recalled the weekend with a demonstration of silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate of the victims of racist violence.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Recruitment Agreement.
In cheerful colors, a life together was staged - as a history of success.
A few Turkish media outlets report as a box here: “Germany’s Gift to the Fifties” is the headline of an article on the Turkish internet platform “Haber X”, which reports on the background of the murderous series.
Nor can the publication of the letter "Hürriyet" for Germany be taken away, in order not to carry out this thought connection.
"It's starting to smell," reads the headline of Ahmet Külahci's column.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The most critically discussed in the German-Turkish Internet forums is the police’s progress and its late success in the search.
Why didn’t the German authorities come up with a plan long ago to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
So many are shown at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity here continues so superficially, the immigrants will have nothing but their own defense and armament."
“That would be the best self-defense.”
"On the quality of clarification and the proportionality of the punishment of the whole network very strongly depends on the internal peace in Germany ", writes "Selen".
What it means, if the internal peace in Germany is in jeopardy, explains the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the burning site in Solingen is deeply embedded in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the assassinations have made the Turkish side feel more reciprocal.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press criticized the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After the blaze in Solingen, he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish president, but at a mourning ceremony in Cologne, he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech then calculated what fees the Turks gave up.
Pretty much as if the value of a person was measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current news of the Turkish media once again shows how deep is the mistrust of many German Turks in the country’s state system.
In addition to seeking extensive clarification and reassessment of right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandal bank at Lake Zurich
Europe’s most affluent bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
It's a German thing to do now.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure from the management of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would enter 2013 into an almost equally spectacular new job: the chairman of the board of the Swiss bank UBS – an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and made friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"The UBS reached turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was already clear in September that everything would turn out completely differently.
One UBS dealer in London circumvented all of the bank’s security systems and wasted approximately 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only a Swiss banker, had to leave.
The chairman of the UBS Board of Directors has also since been on fire – and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber is allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And the chairmanship of the board of directors will take over in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an issuing banker, and would certainly need time to get involved.
She will then take over responsibility for the bank’s strategy, which has just once again proved that it deserves the title of “Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe”.
Because UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and has been sliding from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, the proud Swiss bank will be spared.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of a quiet and solid, but also a smart asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it has moved as an investment bank to the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, says: “I always set UBS as a model for my students at the time.”
"From today's point of view, one asks, 'How could I be so wrong?'
He was greatly mistaken.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the chairman of the board of directors, who was still considered to be a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker, resigned.
A few months later, she wondered why he had left.
The investment division of the bank lost subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To sustain this, UBS announced a real capital increase of 13 billion francs.
However, she really found investors, but ones over whom she would have recently embraced the nose: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008, the situation worsened.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, the chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, the second highest-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: UBS was facing a collapse due to its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought out tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs in compulsory exchangeable bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked – for it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks in its territory.
After all, the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
“We couldn’t save UBS once again,” says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster follows the second.
For several months now, UBS has capitulated in a tax dispute with the United States and has been willing to release data from wealthy customers who, if possible, have cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million – in return for unauthorized profits from these trades, including a fine.
As a result, UBS learned more or less openly that it was helping to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the shrine of discreetness.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it used to be.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in the management of assets to help reduce taxes.
And just as it calmed down a bit, just as UBS was thought to have recovered again, here comes this unhappy business anabasis: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it’s clear: with risk management in investment banking, it still doesn’t work.
“In the case of Adoboli, it has probably been found that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank said: “The problem with UBS is that it cannot manage risk control.”
It was precisely this idea of caution that the Swiss bankers took a long time ago to become guardians of the world’s great assets: not too much risk, but security for money – and this is also the side where the Alpine Republic collapsed again.
The vaults of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank is headquartered in the Bahnhofstraße in Zurich, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rentals of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry stores like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from the Nationalbank to the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is accessed by heavy rotating doors.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front of them are huge leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank a large direction to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
The idea of the Swiss bank, however, has sometimes been suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, eventually closing, like all Swiss bankers, also with both major banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss have nothing more to say about it.
"If only they had adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that UBS changed, first brought it high profits and then disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around the Subprime as the Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was apparent.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million-country decided on the biggest rescue action in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to save the bankruptcy of a large bank.
How could that happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, then they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two out of three Swiss major banks were merged into a large group.
There was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger – and it was still growing.
It helped that the two different UBS bank predecessors complemented each other: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on wealth management and the poorer but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money to spin the big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, the humble, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, the man who drives his feelings around the stomach, who has evolved from banking science all the way up."
But at the end of the day, Ospel was relying on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: “He probably thought his models were real,” Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, at which CEO Wuffli repeated the same motto over and over again: to bring down Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She listed the "League Tables", a sequence that documents the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS was trying to place it all the way up.
A few steps have already been taken.
In the trading of foreign exchange and stocks, the game took part at the very top.
However, the business advisors who have been commissioned highlight one weakness: In international interest rate trading, in the speech of bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided to go on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its fund-based fund invested in U.S. investments in Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that repackaged securities into U.S. mortgage loans and handed them over – but also kept the risks to itself.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there,” says banking expert Geiger.
As big as the euphoria, so deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when cleaning attempts were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a catapulting seat and to this day they are rocking.
Whoever runs a large bank now has almost unmanageable work.
They must find a strategy for the bank that all nearby business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: an end to investment banking, concentration on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank (not yet) wants to go that far.
But the investment banking is going to be severely damaged, so much is now clear.
On Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually only understood as a transitional solution when the bank unexpectedly broke up with its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he is set to conduct UBS business for a long time, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on track in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
However, he still says that he will first find an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of a recession in Europe weighs on the U.S. stock market.
The impending recession in Europe has robbed U.S. investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended impact.
The dampened production of industry on the Continent stifled the seeds of hope for the stabilization of the debt crisis.

Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems have come to the fore again, said Janney Montgomery Scott's Mark Luschini.
In particular, the financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones Standards Index recorded a fall of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points at the end of trading.

In Frankfurt, Dax said goodbye with a 1.2 percent drop at 5,985 counters.
Industry in 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its output and is preparing to put an end to the boom.
Companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
"We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe will not recover so quickly from the recession, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC interview that it would probably not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too early for him to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned a decades-old principle and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM has strengthened the stock price of the traditional group and allowed it to first quote almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.

Smart Crows are Spreading in Cities
In many places, field crows are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals cannot be expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: the crows have been part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some villages people complain about the dirt and noise caused by animals.
However, there is no means against "problem birds" yet in sight.
Field crows may no longer be expelled from the cities, experts said at the first symposium on crows in East Frisian Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible exits.
Searching for alternatives in cities
The conservationists also drew the problems of the cities from the exodus of specially protected field snails: the use of chemistry in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecuting, building up, and cutting down typical nesting trees make life difficult.
The crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are located in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer, among others.
In 2005, a controversial project of mass killing of crows in a rural district caused negative headlines.
Critics have labeled catching animals into bird traps and slaughtering sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal eviction, intimidation, brings nothing," said urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies split and split into other places."
Fear is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't take them away."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is conceivable to combine the expulsion of animals from sensitive habitats and their attraction to settle elsewhere.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens promoted "Information boards instead of chainsaws" because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One bite in the face can finally be best done with self-confidence."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Mrs. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg scientific crow trail, on which information boards provide lessons on the life of a highly intelligent field crow.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Mrs Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: field ravens not only use the aid to reach the pamlska, but even make their own tool as an aid.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior of four field crows to see how far the intelligence of birds can go.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that stones must cause the structure to collapse in order to get to the mole larva.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second experiment, the lubricated crows then had to solve a more flimsy problem.
In the vertically mounted cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a mole larva.
The birds could not reach their prey with their teeth.
However, the researchers put pieces of wire there.
From them, all four animals formed hooks, with which, as a hammer, she snatched a container from the tube behind the handle.
Three out of four field crows even succeeded with a hook.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at 2012 European Championships
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the cup did not go away.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Led by twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made it the perfect fifth in a row to participate in the European Championship after 0-0 in the first match.
The Czechs had enough in the retaliation Play-off with the outsider <0xC4><0x8C>erná Hora scored 1:0 (0:0), when the first match was already a clear thing.
Croatia scored 0–0 against Turkey, Ireland scored 1–1 (1–0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored another goal for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Bundesliga Zvjezdan Misimovic changed penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia has already failed in the play-off matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa against Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal has made a peaceful start.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
A good quarter later, Nani showed his qualities in long-distance shooting and adjusted the hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who failed in the first half, had their first clear chance at goalkeeper Edina Dzek.
The former Wolfsburu player from England at the top of the standing table of Manchester City put the header ball on the bottom edge of the marble, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding stood at the center of the arbitration.
After taking action against Helder Postig in the Bosnian penal area, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.).
On the other side, Stark carried out a controversial penalty kick after the action of Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic changed with certainty.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion clarified everything with four wins.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubt in the 81st minute.
With this, the 1976 European Champion leaves for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilko with the Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome the terrible second already in the initial stage.
The goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech prevented the possible goalkeeper Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Sivok (9th) in the last minute.
Montenegro had its biggest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the turn from the border of the penal area just around the <0xC4><0x8C>ech goal.
After the break, the crossing bar had to save the place of the already defeated world-class Czech goalkeeper, again the attacker FC Soul (50th).
Shortly before the end, the goal was finally clear.
At that moment, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed the 0:0 position in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to release his seat on the third bench at the 2002 World Cup, Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairytale start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan hit only a stick with a shot from a distance, and striker Kazim could also not hang the reflected ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia was still taking control to a greater extent.
The Croatians did not score a goal even after the interruption.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who released Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, there were also Legionnaires from the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, Ireland celebrated their first European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took care of a 4–0 success in the first match already for a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to the lead.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57th) tied for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane had his first good chance.
Only at the last minute did the Estonian defense prevent a possible lead goal.
In the 32nd minute, it was a long way off.
After a failed defense of goalkeeper Pavlo Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball across the line to a 1–0 position.

SAP aims to double the number of its employees in China.
Europe’s largest software producer SAP is investing billions in China in the coming years and aims to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
It is expected to add around $2 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 billion) by 2015, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will build additional R&D facilities and employ relevant staff,” said Deputy Chief Executive Bill McDermott at the Beijing Customer Fair.
The company has now grown from its current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of subsidiaries of the world’s leading enterprise software companies has doubled from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 customers worldwide are booming in the country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfs held around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently, the software manufacturer, which employs 55,000 employees worldwide, is doing business as well as almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal is to support sustained growth in China, with the support of extensive surveys.”
Massacre on a personal level
An emotionally powerful new book by Peter Englund titled Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War begins with such a long list of outstanding characters as your head spins.
One tip on how to behave at the moment: Carefully peel out this page and make a bookmark of it.
You will get to know all the people in Mr. Englund's novel very well and this list will serve as a navigation - like a beacon - in moments when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite appropriately, as "anti-historical work".
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Grief" combines the war experiences of 20 more than a dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the mess of fate, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book differs from classic historical novels.
It corrects the notion that the First World War was only about the horrific trench battles on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Grief" skilfully explores other places where war dramas have taken place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with bee nests falling on them, have to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or face the presence of a tse-tse fly.
From the very beginning, it was a very touching read.
War will devour people’s lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like gunpowder.
When gunshots begin to ring in the distance and you're the woman who's home with your kids, are you going to run away or stay?

Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why the whole war has been unleashed.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," noted Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are generally taken from biographies, letters and other materials already published.
The descriptions of their lives can sound frightening and engaging, but thanks to the inclusion of tiny moments and details, they are absolutely vivid and unbelievable.
Many of them talk about suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Replacements, substitutes everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, imitation aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in sheep fat (and supplemented with a fake bone of wood), dried root tobacco and dried potato peels, wooden sole shoes".
There were 837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes.
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds in himself the inner urges of the barbarian to savageness and brutality, after which he declares about the war: "Finally you will understand that this is human nature. Not sitting in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, I am a civilist in the evening newspaper or a good book and pretending to be behind you,
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
“When a person finally accepts sacrifice, he would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience,” he writes.
Instead, he feels like a “convict who is secretly hanged.”
Other remarks concern the departure of the old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"Conflict with each other has become more and more an economic competition and a competitive struggle," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he called “a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in clothes cut to peace, who carries out his bloodshed without getting off the table.”
People behave completely unexpectedly, the villain alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexual illness from prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front.
“The most striking example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcus pus, which the soldiers bought and used to fight their genitals in the hope that they would end up in the hospital,” he wrote.
"The most desperate rubbed it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is swift, but in no way manifest, which is a great fit for his human theme.
In dozens of minor issues, he captures the way in which the war “has unleashed utterly uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about the First World War mostly worked with clues, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels like "On the Western Front Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most devastating ending, unparalleled in popular scholarly literature.
But I will not reveal it to you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped a page from your list of heroes, and burned it.
After the previous error this time for a minute exactly scheduled raze
Hundreds of policemen took part, some wearing helmets used in street riots.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except a few high-ranking officers, the others were first told that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in charge of the operation, whose presence underscored how many problems the police department had to face.
Cases in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against protesters, which violated the rules of the detachment, and a wave of public sympathy overflowed to the side of the squatters, could not be repeated.
Therefore, a police operation aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park of protesters was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by the operations that took place in other cities.
Massive exercises for emergency behavior took place in the Randalls Island area, which was preparing for the action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up the so-called riot suppression training — counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid relocation of large numbers of police officers — with a focus on the Lower Manhattan city area.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally “at the last minute,” someone said, to whom the action was originally explained only as “exercises.”
"I know a few police officers who were also called to the event, and they certainly didn't tell anyone that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest rank in the department knew about going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had already learned.
On October 14, the city officials planned to clear the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them gathered in the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's action was attended by police from various units, including intervention groups from around the neighborhood - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day a large number of people come and go to the park again, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when as few people as possible would be in the park," he said.
Before the units departed, they lined up at the boundary of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, emergency trucks with arc lamps and amplifiers.
The lights and the recorded message roaring from the amplifiers frightened many protesters.
When law enforcement officers entered the park in their blue windshields, many demonstrators packed their bags and left.
Police say she didn’t touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., giving demonstrators time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park to be able to break into it if arrests were to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman of the police department, said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and in addition, some police officers were rude to them.
Mr Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street leading along the park’s western border could shoot without problems.
The police moved westward and were swept up by a dense mess of personal belongings of the protesters, including luggage and needle bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygiene department, who immediately seized everything left in the park.
Some of the protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park, and documentary footage appeared on the internet a while later.
The most ludicrous group of protesters resorted to a kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some have set up blockades and the police have initiated their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp tied together.
And two people tied themselves to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of “organizing riots and resisting arrest,” he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department's detectives.
Mr. Kelly was present but "didn't participate in the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of policemen waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called.
Blocks were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these places, the police then developed a protective belt even further away from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, policemen were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people even further beyond the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around five in the morning, a protester south of Pine Street was seen jumping onto the hood of a police car, and several others leaking air from police van tires.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for the dismissal
Trade unions representing hundreds of school aid workers who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissal was not necessary and, moreover, it was discrimination, due to the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The court over is probably the last option left to the unions in District Council 37 in their attempt to reverse the dismissal decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents’ coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid employees lost their jobs. Their dismissals were described by union leaders as a retaliation for the city’s access to the fund in the spring of last year.
The city officials categorically denied the allegations.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissal was part of a budget approved in June.
One of the members of the board immediately checked that there was no specific mention in the budget of the dismissal of auxiliary workers.
District Council 37 officials announced that they had already filled in the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. They are convening a press conference on Wednesday, where they will formally notify the suit to the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the defendant will be eight laid off workers, all of whom are African Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would therefore not comment on the individual charges.
According to a draft complaint that the New York Times managed to obtain, the unions focused on the amounts released in the poorer parts of the city, thereby supporting their allegations of unfair treatment, because they believe that the poorer schools have lost more assistants because they have long been beaten by them.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island were not allowed at all and in the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were lost, and in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, 46 assistants were released.
He recalls that five out of eight assistants lost their jobs at Public School 36 in Harlem, despite being a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says, "It's not a neighborhood full of moving parents who can raise funds to offset the deficit in the budget."
The budget of Public School 36 was cut by 3.26% this year, and the school also lost money as the city changed the way it calculates bonus finances for every enrolled poor student.
Trade unions claim, among other things, that the headmasters of secondary schools may have been confused by the way in which the document authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the event, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school's payroll to a database of available workers, whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been released," the complaint's proposal states, "and not just moved to the database to the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
Before that, however, the revolution had to succeed, the long-running dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of U.S. troops was terminated.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Commission will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising.
"With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic endeavours."
The above sentences may seem innocent, but no debate concerning Libya has been so far easy.
Over the summer, lawmakers on both sides have consistently argued with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of statements to approve or, on the contrary, reject the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House due to differences of opinion between the two political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission in Libya was literally in legislative purge – Congress criticized the way President Obama runs the mission, but its members obviously didn’t irritate it enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The hesitation of the congress eventually preceded other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the International Relations Commission "congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity in their efforts to liberate their people" and "praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their allies who have engaged in professional operations to protect the Libyan people."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators be split in two again, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party in the commission.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
This week, the House will vote on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority for nearly all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, enforced by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution relating to the budget or other subject matter to be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
The other legislators have not yet succeeded, despite considerable efforts, in pushing their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to both the House and the Senate - and others are only minor alterations of others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the balanced budget supplement and another handful who would like to "regulate federal spending".
While some of the proposals are identical, their proponents—especially novice Republicans who want to improve their reputation—can boast of their “authority.”
The budget regulation bill, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the balanced budget supplement.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding declaration in support of the creation of such an addendum.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss the limitations on the number of terms in which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms that can be served as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of supplements that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an amendment banning the marriage of same-sex couples as well as an amendment banning the burning of the state flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in designing various additions, they do not deviate significantly from the average in comparison to previous years.
In the 111th Congress, they offered 77 amendments, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even fades compared to the early 1990s, when, according to statistics from the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current politicians.
The last amendment that was added—the 27th Amendment—was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Stripped but not defeated," Gifford said in her first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after being shot in the face by a gunman in a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along with a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow."
Giffords appeared on ABC News' "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, and it was clear that making sentences was still causing her problems and she needed help walking.
The whole show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary due to the injury caused by a bullet that pierced her skull in the front, penetrated the left half of her brain, and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate in a triumphant vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Giffords, a 34-year-old woman, replied, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special on the show "20/20", which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special has been tracking Gifford's entire recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos that Kelly shot during the first week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can’t do more at the time than just lift one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and the therapist teaches her how to perform simple activities.
He nodded his head.
Lip flushing.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a key role in the recovery of Giffords: Congresswoman sings on them along with a song therapist for the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Pet.
During an interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day in therapy, Sawyer revealed that she does not remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said the Giffords read newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six were who were killed in the incident.
Jared Lee Loughner, a suspect in the shooting, is being held in a Missouri prison where he is awaiting trial under the influence of drug abuse.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Awful, awful, awful."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point, during her recovery, his wife said, "I lost."
"So I told her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly said.
"You just got a load.
But you can do it, you can get together, and you can come back stronger than ever.”
Military units meet with compassion rather than with respect.
The event was a gala night on Wall Street that brought out millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don’t have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines were running around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd stood up and cheered enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
In addition to Admiral Mike Mullen, who, however, saw the role of the military units somewhat differently, the chief of staff was also present at the ceremony.
"They were all introduced as some orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was regret.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes glorifying, American public.
The army is indulged in praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if the individual in the uniform regrets.
"We are not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is about to leave Afghanistan, said in a statement.
"But it seems that the only way some people can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the once returning troops from Vietnam was far worse.
As a result, most of the words of regret are spoken in silence and in privacy among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat operations where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service would be watched from two angles by people outside the army.
From the perspective of some, they will feel respect and wonder, because they have defeated enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
But others will drill their heads to see if “a bad, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who took part in fighting in Iraq and returned to Washington to take a seat in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him indiscriminately suggested whether he could withstand the stress associated with working in Washington so soon after returning from the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The military’s concern stems in part from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield rarely reap recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and finds little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it used to be during World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to take tough action against rape.
This week, it will be decided whether to start a trial of 28 women and men against the army for alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, they are ready to file a lawsuit against hundreds of other applicants.
Elizabeth Lyman, a first-class soldier, was allegedly raped by her military colleague on the night she was 25 years old and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join him for a drink in her room.
"I had a warning light in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texasan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I could listen to my instincts."
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed, and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former military members will await the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against his former defense minister, Donald Gafeld, will be brought before him.
The allegations state that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke and the prosecuting party had 17 members at the time. However, in the following months, their number increased to 28 - 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted in the same way as they were sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the arsenal.
Burke says she's going after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent attempts to impose measures against such acts?
Burke also claims to have contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of further lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than group all the accusations into this case - she put all the eggs in one basket, as she herself says - she will file lawsuits in several different cases, if necessary, so as not to ease the pressure.
The defense team is led by U.S. Attorney General Neil MacBride, who together with his associates filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy—in principle, current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court Ordinance called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the defendants," the document said.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in battle, it is only a matter of vocabulary: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clearly defined frontline.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women present in the war zone.
The result: between these wars, 150 female soldiers fell - two-thirds of them directly in battle.
The time has come for modernization in the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, and three other lawyers are working on the case.
At Yale Law School, veteran law service attendees are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere of hatred for women.
Regardless of this, a non-profit organization of U.S. Vietnamese veterans' Service gathers evidence for its lawsuit against the army. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder", which was allegedly detected in rape victims, so that the army has a pretext for their release, according to Bwa
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against a state-owned veterans’ organization, which it accuses of discriminatory practices that were supposed to occur in processing requests for help from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented to Congress by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Violence Prevention and Resolution Office, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains largely unreported, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In a report issued in March, the level of prosecution of suspects is also discussed: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military were brought to court - half of the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks as the first of a series of traumas.
For example, a first-class soldier Lyman reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, she said, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and in her bed, the blood of the attacker was found - from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended court hearings, during which she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned to testify in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was made," Lyman says.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there - with a scream I ran out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'It wasn't his trial. It was mine.'"
The Lymans ordered a visit to a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, describing her as ineligible for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to service.
Whether the Lyman and other plaintiffs’ case moves to the next stage or not, it’s a long-running one, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of negotiation."
Between them and the verdict, however, is the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment it saw the light of the world.
I am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is several decades behind because their responsibilities do not teach them to adhere to the same degree of motivational stimulus and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen when good people are willing to fight.
Unless a hearing is decided in their favour, Burkevoá, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons ready to file a lawsuit and start working on other cases related to this issue.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, where there will be no reform," he said.
Or until we die, depending on what comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Examine You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous rage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer while preparing for the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy – just go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting them isn’t that hard at all,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently released report by the UK research team on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says, that scientists had enough to simply use the ads on the site and thus accurately identify the demographic group they were looking for – something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups to be optimistic about them, and then they turned their attention to them and sent them advertisements. But instead of inviting them into a newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they called them to meet their demands.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries – without having to leave the office at all.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are generally young men who are describing an increasing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are smarter, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.”
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and political researchers use this site to study everything from health problems to social trends hiding with state updates, wall posts, and the pressed "Like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them will provide three different data on an average daily, which makes this social network literally an "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic papers, in the name of which the word "Facebook" appears on the front page of the 800%, has risen over the
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"In the past, when you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to a side where they'd never let you go," Bartlett says.
“Facebook is breaking down all this – you’re just going straight to them.”
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken outcomes on Facebook were much more at risk for the problem of alcoholism than students who remained silent about the topic.
Moreno suggests that student peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved unless you can diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that we would otherwise not have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The website's information team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election turnout in 2010 and the nation's satisfaction ratio (mainly using the information they had accessed - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its research information treasure more accessible).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the ability to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site needs to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
“I don’t think most users even thought that scientists could look at their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using his students’ public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it as information only between them and their friends."
Then there is also the question of methodology.
Even with offline research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
It is not possible to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and posts on the wall are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn said.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook are still the best possible tool that can be used in research.
“When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
“Social research should be about society and social activities – and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place offline.”
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to plotting two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “rebel” fighter during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he told the court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the court because you have been given a mandate by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess my deeds, but I confess no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a platform from which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought with him a prepared speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for four weeks, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was held firmly under the lock.
All of them participated in order to move the case to an early conclusion.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhumane," one of the survivors of the attack told a NRK commentator.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional all the time of the hearing. When arriving and leaving the building without any problems in view of the journalists present and the survivors.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre notion that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge admitted that he was not insane, noting that there was no evidence that he had any accomplice.
It may be comforting for some that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of the only extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sadness and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it's not," said one of the victims' relatives.
"If it were, it would be a lot easier."
7 Lessons From A Lost Interview With Steve Jobs In A Movie Going To The Movies This Week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, people began to compare him to Henry Ford - and elected him as his genius The Greatest Modern Inventor.
At the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted for a special movie that’s going to the cinema this week, for all Apple fans, it will be the fact that his creative mind has perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-styled member of the hippie movement, but also a pedant organizer and a person who fits every detail into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "from the idea that a really great idea is a product out of a 90 percent of their work... [but] the idea between a committee and a company is a coincidence."
In 1995, Bob Cringley worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Madness, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the shoot, a unique, more than hourly interview took place.
By that time, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy working with his new computer company, NeXT, and looking forward to how broad the public would embrace the Internet.
In the end, only a brief part of Cringely's entire interview was used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were reported to have been lost during transportation.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly cut, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: A Lost Interview, which targets selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is famous for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, here Jobs seems surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
He also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you see how Jobs thinks the answer perfectly, to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when he acts impatiently at Cringely’s questions and urges him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and it’s filled with frighteningly prophetic thoughts as Jobs assesses what other companies are doing right and wrong, offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Jobs' posthumous reviews of his career, but on Jobs, whom we see here as a yearning dreamer in the bloom of his genius, there is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision of what things might and should look like.
It did not take long, and after he had expressed his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from The Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"Over the years of business, I've always asked, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer has always been the same: 'Well, that's how it's done.'"
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about things related to business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his effort to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - they often began with the inscription "standard costs", their amount could only be imagined. At that point he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs in a moment.
How he made a grid for the pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
A lot has been written about this device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
He and Wozniak tested their devices using a paid phone, allowing them to switch from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
“At least half a dozen times we’ve been around the world like this, so when we shouted something into a paid phone, it sounded a minute later from the other phone at the door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young and we found that we can build something ourselves that is capable of running billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us made a little thing that could control a much bigger dragon – it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have been created without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a joke that Wozniak and I almost finished. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, pretending to be Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were summoned to speak to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up the Pope himself, the couple got up and put their headphones down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a kmometer, he found Bill Hewlett's phone number in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company really is and how it should behave towards its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited company research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor and I immediately fell in love with him.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher at HP, sneaked around the computer and started writing programs for it.
How Innovation Is Invented:
In several places, Jobs talks about how he invents new products while running.
Early in his career, when he went on to sell a pair of boards with circuit boards, one customer asked him to assemble an entire computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing computer mice:
"I remember how wildly we argued... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] for me to stop having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are breathing:
Long before leading Apple’s resurrection, Jobs prudently predicted that many industry leaders would slump in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, well, what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are already in place, so companies are headed by people who take care of this, while people who take care of their own products are expelled from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led society to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it is, it could have been Microsoft of the 1990s...
Instead of winning, however, they lost.
How to take innovation as a form of art:
"There's still a long way to go between a great idea and an excellent result... and as the great idea develops, it changes and grows."
During that time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to make a whole range of compromises - you just don't force electrons, glass, robots or factories to do certain things.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things all the time – different concepts – and put them together...
In the end, it depends on the taste - you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in some way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed to steal the best ideas.
The Macintosh company was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they could do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas were having dinner with opponents of the health care law at a time when their case was being dealt with by the court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether to accept an objection to President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a ceremonial dinner that was sponsored by the law firm.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the motions submitted.
One of the cases under discussion was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the radical overhaul of health care that Congress passed last year — a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, which will further expand the outcome of the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of issuance of the ruling.
The lawyer who will stand trial and try to get the law rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner group, which has been advocating conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
It was attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican representative and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
Scalia and Thomas are the guests.
This is nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the Federalist Society for years.
There is absolutely nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempted from the obligation to observe the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would definitely fall under the C4 principle, which states that "a judge may take part in events that are organised by related organizations and other organizations in order to obtain funds, but the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor be listed on the agenda of the event."
Nevertheless, Scalia and Thomas’ relationship with the two law firms acting in the case, as well as the company with a huge financial interest in the case, was rich enough to warn activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is inconsistent with several judges' claims that the Supreme Court behaves according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges drank and dined for the benefit of society, along with the lawyers who are waiting for their case to be heard in court.”
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines any claim of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics and told them that they too easily combined their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a conservative activist.
In addition, the Conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared in court.
Kagan’s critics are pushing her to renounce her participation in the case, claiming that she fought so much for the law at the time that she could now be disinterested.
Kagan did not suggest that she was going to step down.
Boeing wins record-breaking $18 billion jet contract
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-engine jets with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of their products, it’s usually no reason to celebrate.
But if the company is a Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the price of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, it’s something else.
Equally important is where Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing today announced its largest order in history in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 twin-jet Boeing 777s.
A sensational deal came from Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing announced that the airline would be able to purchase another 20 aircraft, bringing the total value of the order to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes referred to as the Dreamliner, which boasted significantly better fuel consumption and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
“This is excellent news for Boeing as a whole,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
This means that not only do they have money to pay for aircraft, but the rise in the price of fuel - mostly damaging airlines because it is one of their biggest costs - is not so crucial, because the country itself makes money on higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to higher fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Emirates contract consolidates Boeing’s leading position in the wide-body aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to a narrow company that wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, will be delayed.
The delay occurred because customers demanded greater payloads of the aircraft and the flyover, so the manufacturer took the time to deliver more engine power to the machine.
The share price of Boeing Co rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president’s sister reportedly defeated in Michoacán election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was helped in the hunt for the governor's chair by drug dealers.
Sister Felipe Calderón appears to have lost in the violent state election for the post of governor in Michoacán, after which she declared on Monday that one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug dealers.
The preliminary results were attributed to Faust Vallej by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in the Western state's presidential election.
"The intervention of members of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially in the course of yesterday's election itself, is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for the whole of our country," Calderon said in an interview on radio the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion polling group... They entertained ballot boxes, they built roadblocks... and they let people vote for PRI.
The PRI party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the loss of its presidency in 2000.
However, he plans an early return to power, and winning the Michoacán election is an important step in this endeavor.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who was leading the day before the election, only very tightly.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), which until now controlled the Governing Body, is a very unfortunate loss for the controversial and unfortunately persecuted party ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state’s capital city of Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and urges other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderon and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he launched a military struggle against smugglers.
Violence, however, persisted.
The PAN mayor, Luisa Marie Calderon's supporter, was assassinated just a week before the election and many candidates resigned out of fear.
However, whatever the results of the Michoacán elections may look like for the PRI party, winning the party will help get a new impetus.
The expected representative of the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Washington, congratulated Vallejo, saying, "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has urged India and China to be prepared to help rescue the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be a global economic downturn, which would also have a negative impact on Asian economic growth.
Rajat Nag, ADB’s Manila-based CEO, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies must “do everything in their power” to help a swift recovery of the monetary bloc through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRICS countries were watching all of Europe’s problems “too unnerved” and said Asian financial aid combined with European leadership and funds would help reverse the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in it together."
“So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is fit,” he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is definitely not immune.”
"So if China and India can help, they definitely should."
The European Monetary Association has been undergoing a severe debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have stepped down.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that it could drag the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge to unite the newly flourishing major economies and help the eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union's Financial Assistance Fund, the European Financial Stability Institution - would give Asian partners of European countries more negotiating opportunities.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do what it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to India’s 1.2 billion people when 800 million of them live on $2 or less per day.
"Once they might find that the Greeks are retired at 50 and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would be hard to explain to them," he said.
Lee Howell, director general of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stockpiles should be used to maintain well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and lossy sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis threatens a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank’s forecast that Asia will see 7.5% economic growth between 2011 and 2012 is now facing a “risk of decline” due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must create “plans of unpredictable spending” to protect them from falling and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warns of possible defence cuts
Defense Minister Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress dutifully put under the boiler when he warned that erupting automatic budget cuts could jeopardize national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next decade, but now fears a further $600 billion if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress’s inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called suspension would result in a 23% flat-rate decline and the halting of many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you can't buy only three-quarters of a building or ship. In addition, further modernization efforts could be severely damaged," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian personnel, and since the reduction is expected to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave in order to be able to meet the target requirements."
“These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its readiness.”
Eventually, the cuts will also affect combat units, Panetta said.
"Although the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not be directly affected by this halt, the operations there will be adversely affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract personnel, which will result in delays in agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"Payment-paying staff will be reduced, resulting in delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
Both senators responded to Panett’s letter ten days ago, asking him for details about the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of the halt at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this tough measure," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
“Planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow.”
“It will only be seen whether Panett’s letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and intensify the votes calling for the Pentagon to be removed from the list of areas cut off.
Panetta has recently been increasingly open in talks about possible cuts, even though he has moved on to his senior position in the Pentagon with years of experience approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was getting into a tough fight.
At a press conference held a minute a week, the defense minister suggested a brief picture of what his resort can expect - an army shell, but within which the core will be missing.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"It'll be like aviation without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings, and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of his speech at the Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In an annex delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham Panett, he specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitations in the capabilities of deployments and deployments around the world; assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could be expected to be completed, including those that are already being tested, as well as those that are still in the early stages of planning.
For example, the list included a project of an F35 aircraft, a planned new bomber, a next-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the army and navy wanted to replace the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which is needed to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A quick look at recent newspaper headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with the accusation that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of false testimony when they tried to hide records that a retired football coach sexually assaulted a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama, with a microphone running, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy entire careers and enclose the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of misusing his campaign finances to try to conceal his unmarried relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that crashed around Bill Clinton when he lied in the second period about his sexual intercourse with Monica Lewinsky.
Everywhere there are stories of cheating at school and at university.
There are times when teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make them look good in their assessments.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many frauds do we face?
Studies show that in a single day you will find somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first encounter.
Determining lies, or “recognizing lies,” is an essential skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or work reasons.
But it's not a social game that's like, say, Sharad, when a person shouts, "I have you." Deception recognition is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades in the field of psychology, project universities and research in the course of detailed research.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
The liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're sneezing, sneezing, reddening, or messing around.
But don’t assume that it’s hard to spot and uncover a liar.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the sentence structure, small expressions in the face, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a vast and evolving industry related to the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that can be easily learned and in today's complex world can help you a lot - especially in the case of leadership, especially if it is one of your occupations.
Good liars are able to read well in others, let them be immersed in vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more “self-centered” lies, while women say more lies “focused on others” – mostly to protect someone’s feelings – that married people lie less often to their partners than single people do.
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called “early observation.”
Thanks to him, he will have later findings with which to compare.
Notice the body posture of the subject, his laughter, work with the voice.
You should know if someone is ordinarily constantly tapping their feet, so as not to unjustly accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But take it only as warning signals, not as proof of a lie.
People who tell a lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their fictional story, the tips of the shoe can turn to the door, lean toward the exit, significantly change the posture, or show "relief after the end of the conversation."
People conducting interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like after it is over.
Also understand the subject’s language.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once rebuked and used the past time when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which sparked a nationwide search for her body.
Liars can also express themselves proportionately: "I did not have any sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question throughout.
The most common verbal signs are only very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "easy language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to my best consciousness."
In such a response, we will not know too much of the facts, and this is often another warning signal.
There is no magic to uncover every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills with which a lie can be uncovered.
With the help of these skills, a person will have a better chance of not encountering a liar and fraud in his personal and work.
The controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delayed approval by the U.S. government appeared
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which angered unions but reassured environmentalists - the company in charge of pipeline construction announced that it was willing to redirect the project.
TransCanada announced on Monday night that it would move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada’s Alex Pourbax says the company believes the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
The announcement came after the Foreign Ministry last week announced that it was postponing the decision to authorize the federal project, from where it would not conduct studies of possible alternative routes that would prevent it from reaching the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground watershed.
“This is really a move forward,” Republican deputy Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the foreign ministry would likely postpone any decision until 2013, a year after the elections next year, but authorities are refusing to say that politicians would play a role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile-long pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil are leaked every day.
Six states will have to go through this process.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by the workforce, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear while working on the pipeline.
However, lawmakers in Nebraska opposed the plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said the Ministry’s inspector general had ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
Once upon a time, the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s adviser in 2008, did not represent a conflict of interest in the program.
Next, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of vomiting fears because of her toddler
The New York family says singer Patti LaBelle rushed into the lobby of their Manhattan home and frightened their daughter so that she vomited out of fear.
The release of the hit song "Lady Marmalade" frightened eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit filed before the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10th last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk drove the car, Roseanna Monk gathered her luggage down into the lobby of their house on Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes,' and I went to pick her up.
LaBelle annoyed the pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she told me, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you think.'"
She got angry and started talking dirty - she shouted the simplest expressions out loud...
She had a bottle of water and started pouring water on me.
He claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to be stopped by her escort, which then dragged her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The girl screamed so loudly that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter of apology to LaBelle, but no response was received.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokeswoman are not answering our phone calls to comment on the whole case.
The lawsuit calls for an unspecified compensation but family attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money raised to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The goal is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"Such behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month-old child in her arms."
Climate change has slowed the economy.
During the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment and, with them, the economy declined.
The year 2011 will be inscribed in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which calls itself the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to the unfavorable development of no upturn in the climate conditions at the beginning of the year.
The low February temperatures caused millions of losses in the field of agriculture, limited the opportunities for the growth of the state economy, have on the conscience of a decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture, there was a historical decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of the sectors.
According to the report on damage caused issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% was found to be partial damage.
The decline in economic activity up to November caused a steady increase in unemployment by 9% of the population. The unemployment rate in the state increased by 6% of the population. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased during the first three quarters. From January to March, the unemployment rate was 55% of the population of the state, compared with 55% of the population of Sinaloa.
Less liquidity
According to Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, it is possible to explain the increase in unemployment indirectly, based on the steps that have been taken at the level of public policy.
"We have witnessed an increase in unemployment, which is related to a variety of factors. These include, among other things, loss of market liquidity due to resource constraints due to legislation approved by Congress in the fight against money laundering. For people who do not illegally invest in them, they don't get them out.
Stopping migration
López Cervantes said that a demographic factor is also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, both because of the difficult entry and then also because even if these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. People, therefore, remain and demand work from our state, and so unemployment",unemployment.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy 60.38% of the population employed in the state work without paying benefits to the administration of social security.
Unemployment and unreliability are added to other features of the labour market, such as low wages. In this administrative area are the lowest wages from across the country, as indicated by the registries of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat for Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Reducing Foreign Direct Investments
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, foreign direct investment reached $ 630,697 in the year, representing a 14% decrease in the $ 312 percent before the $ 87,74% for the period.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government lists investments in the amount of 17,280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly directed to enterprises in the field of services.
Debt
In connection with the scenario of a decline of the economy, the government of this state asked in July the state congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress did not approve the loan for the amount of 2 600 million pesos.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Maria López Valdés pointed to the lack of government management skills.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of coordination of the will of the individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really small during this year. We have to work intensively to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012, we have to double our efforts, there was a lack of harmonization of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government.
The slowdown of the economy
Loredo López said that events such as frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore the dynamics that would allow it to reach acceptable levels of movement of processes, products and services.
Re-defining the mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed for more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we are observing that work is being done. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important that all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has be mobilized," he said.
The work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there have been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress in the direction of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to argue that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced to 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for holding eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic reported that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of an offence of threat to health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by members of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a march in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite 80 station in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was driving in a pick-up van of white color. He had a black bag in the car in the shelf and a small backpack on the passenger seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man remained available to the Judges of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impact of Crimes.
Owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk of not being reached to the end or being greatly delayed due to lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The Director of Urban Social Development said that if construction work had progressed until now, now there is a threat that the state government would not be able to secure appropriate supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state is responsible for 25%. Until now, the funds for work have been provided only by the Federation and the city, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of projects.
"They are supposed to secure almost 12 million and although the year is already coming to an end, we have not received anything at all. And even though we should have gotten a part already in July," he said. "To not waste time, we started projects and they continue very well, but we lack money."
He said that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not meet the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to be able to pay more than 7 million, which the state administration did not give them.
"The same thing has happened to us already in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the mentioned programs this year, we had to get the funds to cover what the state did not finish," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise on the part of state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary for Administration and Finance, to speed up the process and the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
“They were supposed to give us $12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven’t even gotten a peso yet.”
Court Approves End of Analog Broadcasting in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which wants to speed up the so-called "off analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of the four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree listing the individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed because the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to express its views on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains in force, had not been reached.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter reserved by law to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel). Thus, there is a violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and exclusion.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to fight against the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requests and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitization.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the lawsuit filed by the House of Representatives without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which is also under the care of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards measures to prepare public administration.
“I don’t think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” he said, adding that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It believes that postponing the change would delay the benefits of digitalisation, which requires decisions on matters of public interest, since digitalisation has not only a technical dimension, but "also touches on economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he emphasized, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the hands of the state government".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical bodies at their disposal.
He said it was not possible for the government, by issuing a disapproving decree, which to some extent interferes with the jurisdiction of Congress, to introduce into the administration the observance of laws prepared by the legislature.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to data published by the Prep, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, 879 votes out of 6074 constituencies have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "voice-by-voice" appeared in this year's election in Michoacán, where according to data published by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) there is a difference between the first and second place in the governor's election of less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been counted by 60 votes out of 879 votes.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llandar Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral authority approved a series of measures that should harmonize local norms with federal electoral reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacán did not formally confirm the constitution of the state or its electoral code or the law on electoral justice. The state congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force had expired in this election period.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the vote of the head of state on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because he has no right to "neither approve nor veto".
When asked about the possibility of a "voice-by-voice" census, María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM, it will be possible for the partial and total census to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and calculation in the relevant box or it is not available to the president; or if there have been errors and errors in the election results.
In addition, the total recount of votes in all polling stations will be possible if there are indications that the difference between the potential election winner and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the session there is an express request to the candidate/representative.
The total number of votes may also be recalculated if, after proper recalculation, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request of the political party, the candidate of which has been elected with the second place.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 out of 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Mount of Fire, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. A ceremonial ceremony and a mass of suffocation will take place on Monday.
According to the family, the Lieutenant Colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Mount of Fire.
After receiving the highest honors, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital, Coahuila, aboard a Mexican Air Force plane. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant-colonel’s ashes arrived at the chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell was held at the Technological Institute in Saltillo, organized by his former high school tech classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of preparation for his graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapaliname Mountains, and that's how he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and entered the Colegio del Aire Air School in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even drove a truck, yet he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he just came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died at what he loved most in life: flying.
They gave him the last farewell
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, the lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to him to give up the governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the student of the Mexican Air Force in 1985, the student of the center, and the leader of the
Bacio Cortés died in recent days after the helicopter he was driving crashed. On board were also the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of this state.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Bacio Cortés, a native of Saltillo (ashes), arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force through the funeral service under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez to the space where the family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, and the other students gathered.
Three dead bodies found on Cadereyta NL farm
A few hours before the discovery, military officials introduced to the media 11 people who were detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men shot dead in different parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned estate of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on a 1.5-kilometer highway from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with a beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the people wore a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him was also a man in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further away, the body of another person was dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lay face down on the ground.
According to the data obtained at the scene, all three people were likely killed in another place because no ammunition was found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime the other and also a series of traces of bullets, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects detained in Cadereyta
The Secretariat of the National Defence presented 11 individuals, including youth, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and which is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
According to published information, eight people were detained in the Los Alveros colony during the first attempt on 11 November and one detainee was freed.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured and confirmed to be members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6 a.m., military personnel were on a roundabout in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they noticed cars without a license plate and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and found one rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Then, on the basis of these statements, on 13 November, at about 2 p.m., one of the accomplices in the area of La Frauda was arrested, and when he saw the soldiers, he tried to flee.
They were accused of illegal burials in the villages of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that keeps the country above the abyss of an economic catastrophe.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that keeps the country above the brink of an economic catastrophe that has put the entire eurozone in danger.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
He is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were being overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has caused the amount of debt to climb to an unsustainable level.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough package of austerity measures that European leaders are demanding, only then will it be possible to restore Italy's broken credibility.
Due to the volatility of the markets, interest rates on Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity exceeded the 7 percent threshold, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailouts.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers’ organisation Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: “We said we would strongly support this government.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this acute situation.
Monti’s hopes for success were greatly multiplied by the support of PDL Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, the centre-right party's secretary, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because up to now a number of its members have opposed the government with the technocratic majority that Monti constitutes.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support in order to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti’s failure could mean disaster.
Monti began talks on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations.
The round of talks will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who made it possible to proceed very quickly in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline at the end of last week, when it was already apparent that Berlusconi would resign, interest rates on Italian bonds have returned to the critical frontier, responding to uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, whose public debt amounts to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion, would be beyond the scope of the eurozone’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should hold on to power until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians would only give him time to carry out reforms and then hold early elections.
Monti said he would like to incorporate policies into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government should only be made up of experts in order to get Italy out of the troubles the country has gotten into due to financial pressure.
Political sources have said that bilateral mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicates the attempt to include both political figures in the government.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 players called has reached the number 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, if we compare the 22 players of the two countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, FIFA’s number one monthly rating, have a wide range of A-Class inter-selection matches on their account, Costa Rica has only Michael Uman, the only defender to have played 50 international matches.
This number was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers who play in the Stars Match and in the powerful clubs of the English First League maintain intense activity at league championships and home cups and high-level matches within European Cups such as the Champions League for over a year.
To the previous one, we must also add the experience of the Spanish national team in complicated knockout matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has on their account the goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (losing 0-1 in London) to the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will also play against Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 matches in his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially declared UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have a hundred games on their account. Among them already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and middle forward Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol has scored 97 games.
Following are Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Uman move left wing Junior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Only 5 overcame the limit of 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 games in Spain, they include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stand Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"The journey to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that for them the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The band is on tour in South America to celebrate its 20th anniversary and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20th.
This day will perform from 19:30 at the National Stadium together with the angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example of an interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the La Nación website.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream, which becomes a reality.
In South and Central America we are barely the second time and the experiences so far have been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It's a wonderful country and I believe we will be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to be able to bring you our music.
I ask, because here they literally adore the group, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your biggest fans?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve shown in the last 21 years have been made in a matter of weeks.
We did some great shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully we got into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we love the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. So we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limits on what we can't do.
We will try to showcase the best show with a variety of tracks. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's that?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs we’ll play each night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven’t played for a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised, because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have already forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that’s why I think it’s more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure you are.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and that we'd stay in it for more than 20 years, that sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and it impresses us that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are fortunate to be able to look at the places we have always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which the giants themselves are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends, too often it does not happen.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We are proud of that and we are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are fortunate that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to keep together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, firstly, we are all lucky to be still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We’re all close friends, and that’s why we’ve managed to open up musical pathways that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment on their own.
We believe in each other, we value each other’s music, and I don’t think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word glory was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became increasingly easier to find a balance.
We try not to ride too much on a tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you will remember that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You must not be taken away by being famous, rock stars. This has never really interested either of us.
What do you think of Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs and at the beginning it was something great.
As a band, we existed for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating, because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we make friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember how happy I was with Andy, how unbelievable he was.
She was an incredible person and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the forerunners?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influences you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all night about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge even though it’s no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt slightly separated from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I imagine the bands that I mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came into being at the same time. And if music is still valid today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney don't play today.
At first, your music had a slightly gloomy character, and now it’s more positive.
What is behind this change?
That’s interesting because I feel like there are a few tracks on the new album that are lighter-looking, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very gloomy, although they can sound like positive.
At both of them, when Ed played it for me, I was crying, and those songs are deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent that to me.
I also think that you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss in his lower limbs, his doctor said.
72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and doctors are currently under control.
MEP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told TV station Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases within three days to find out why he is hurting and why he is losing strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said he believes Fujimori could get pardon for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not wish to be pardoned because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times for cancer of the tongue, shed 18 kilograms and added to these problems other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, cysts on the pancreas, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor noted.
Fujimori has served his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murder squad of the army operating illegally in the first years of his rule.
Mujica to visit Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. It aims to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and touch on the political themes of the given region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a large-scale visit full of meetings with representatives of politics, commerce and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to persuade Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community, prompting a rejection of Uruguay's position and consultation with the ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November. The G20 is a group formed by the world’s most powerful developing and developed countries. With the aforementioned Latin American country, an agreement on the exchange of information has been concluded since January of this year to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretize fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the "blacklist" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a trade point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Sloppy plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love of stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to all stores around the world this month, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to wear glasses.
“Mario is a character who has to tell how stereoscopy should work without glasses,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a Nintendo spokesman for Spain, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier", because until now successful footage such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to being a 3D movie, Super Mario 3D Land is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you pass this level, you can take part in the "second round" at levels of the game that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real-time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome a variety of challenges and "do not succumb to optical deceptions".
This new 3D appearance of Super Maria also involves the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays into the notes of those who watch the saga and repeats the successful formula from previous parts. It consists in the fact that the plumber of a bearded man will have to pass through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in the movements, in the surroundings, in the costumes and also among the enemies, the "playing" Luigi also appears.
Colom approves Portilla's release to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken steps to extradite former President Alfonso Portillo, who is expected to be held accountable in the United States for the $70 million conspiracy to launder.
This is the end of a process aimed at getting Guatemala to respond to a request from a northern country requesting the extradition of Portillo to be tried.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was consistent with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his term of office he "did not interfere" in court decisions and allowed all extraditions that came to his table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious harm to health and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colombo's move means a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead the process against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent of the robbery of $120 million to the Department of Defense during his presidency. This process preceded the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and thus brought the case back into play.
Trinity helps 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to help children without education not to be on the fringes of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of existence of the organization of social support of Trinj is very important: 6,000 young people who were threatened with social exclusion have been helped. The organization for 25 years helps them to overcome difficult situations.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary also served to introduce the balance sheet as part of a ceremonial act that took place in the former production facilities of Fabra i Coats and attended by more than 300 people.
The Trinity Organization was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, without work, struggling with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have worked with the association for the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, during the elections, showed the unified nature of the work carried out by the Trinity.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremonial act was attended by former socialist education adviser, Ernest Maragall, and former deputy mayor and current eco-socialist councillor, Ricard Goma.
Current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also visited the large Fabra and Coats Hall.
Mas said that the Trinity was created in a very difficult time and that today also presents a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to date "is a good foundation".
The President cited the Trinity as an example of how it is possible to fight against unfavorable circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does,” he said.
There was an eviction of the house taken away, in which gigantic parties were held
Intruders seized 11 of 13 apartments in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
Everything suggests that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally inhabiting yesterday at noon, where they organized gigantic parties to wake up the neighbors. They left the building by court order without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the administrator said.
The occupants, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, huge parties took place, lasting up to two days, and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque stresses that the occupants of the building made her unfair competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the discotheque costs 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors about the noise. But the problems were not caused by the visitors of the discotheque, but the inhabitants of the house taken, and especially those who participated in the parties organized here, whose frequency and intensity has increased in recent weeks, according to the eyes of the
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and forgave her for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The head of the city group of the PP People's Party at the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for "the building to be moved immediately and thus end the problems of civic coexistence suffered by the neighbors and the destruction of the area".
The Prime Minister explained that only one floor had been removed before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers had entered all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there were even thefts.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be consistent when it comes to the acts against civil responsibility that took place in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police entered the 35th building on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of writing out the procedure, which carries with it more than a controversy about fees
The city’s 16-gate competition reopens the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the greatest bloom, the already extinct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this municipality printed several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as a large metropolitan park in Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the disappearance of the CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the top of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that does not focus on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildlings instead of the Yogi bear.
That was the position until September, when the town hall declared a mega contest consisting of 16 contests for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate captures the idea of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to place the gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and on the basis of reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already a topic as blunt as when two members of this old caste, chosen during a meeting in the elevator, shake hands.
And it was this act that sparked one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and prominent university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition has its justification.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side" as well, so Ildefonso Cerdo's speech on green apples was not touched upon until the end.
“We have to assume that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, its high availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "the gate to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as defining areas where it is possible to operate".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona, with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" posing "some dangers".
The danger of "the uncertainty that the public place project presents today" after the experience of the 1980s, which had its "swan singing" in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Defining something means taking the next step," that is, basically taking it one step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban planning and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we look in more detail at the question, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona part does not, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which "must not end up in the garbage dump", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his body that will intervene in the project from the "first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is some sort of leak that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "does doubt" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds), which need to be created: "Architects should be able to
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name to this game is complex, because there is a lack of Collserola's global vision in the tender documents: "There have been 16 tenders that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no such longitudinal study that would take place on the whole".
This means that at least he has signed up for all 16 nominations.
Otherwise, the design of a single gate may interfere with the concept and definition of an architect of a neighboring gate.
In his opinion, the town hall should ensure that the zone located directly above the Ronda de Dalt should provide a full-length zone of equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
The casino pardoned Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, legal representative Cadino Red pardoned his brother, Mayor of Monterrey, in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after Casino Red’s legal representative granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court in that district, which was investigating a case of blackmail in which Mayor Monterrey’s brother was charged.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas was to ask him to pay the economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Hall to operate illegally at the betting house.
After public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office began prosecuting the brother of the Panist mayor. On 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours spent in front of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, No. 3 for property crimes was transferred to Prison 1, located in the Barrio Antiguo in the state’s capital.
He remained at the scene for the next 49 days after the second detention decree was issued and a Public Prosecutor’s Office agent denied the possibility of involvement or organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Criminal Court on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red in the amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained in prison for only a few hours with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
During the trial, he was allowed to remain in city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence had been collected to prove Jonas' guilt. Among the evidence will be that a million pesos will be paid for, for example, part of a cassette.
This Monday, Casina Red's legal representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, handed over to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region. On the basis of this, he will be able to return to freedom soon.
During the legal hearing, the Attorney General's representative to the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the associates decided to grant pardon, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal pardon. In the process that was conducted against him, it will not be possible to file any complaint. It is also not possible to request compensation for damages or punishment.
After a hearing with the legal representative at around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Bretón.
The clerk of the court, Jorge Yanez, came to the prison in the town of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and his case had been deposited in the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gave details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of an investigation into the accident that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven others indicate that the helicopter hit the ground in full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft took off, the pilot noted that the climatic conditions allow for flights.
"Parts that appear indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings were entangled in branches of trees 25 meters from where the unit lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 people, therefore it met all requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, it stated that no components were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the area of impact.
"During the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft are not located elsewhere, so the aircraft collided with the ground as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, met all requirements for the transportation of people.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment it is most important to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the moment of the collision, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at excursion speed and the accident occurred on a soft ascent terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a normal overflight operation," he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome listed six main points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at takeoff, according to which the aircraft proceeds towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The collision coordinates and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory before the impact.
Dissipation of aircraft remnants in restricted territory:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the collision occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The plane's scattering pattern indicates that the helicopter was intact at the time of the landing.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident that there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several contacts with the land.
During fieldwork, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is weighed, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show shots in which there was probably a breakdown along the aforementioned route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After careful search around the accident, in a territory that is larger than the landing area, the remains of the helicopter were not found, which reinforces the assumption that the collision occurred in a state when the helicopter was still intact.
Mexican Institute of Health Insurance Launches Research on the Gene that Causes Obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research aimed at detecting the gene that causes obesity in children and adolescents. Research called "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will allow to obtain results related to overweight.
In a report, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Research Medical Unit in Biochemistry at the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Center of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvesta) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, whether authorized or not, can also participate in the research. People can come to the participating sports centers of IMSS in Valle de México, where they will be tested by juveniles every council from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexico State) and since 8 October this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children have been obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and eventually at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to determine the components and significance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to track down risk factors in Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the goal is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He clarified that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) are performed every Saturday with all participants, blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels are determined, and genes are examined (trying to identify the genes that are involved in the development).
Cruz López said the research reflects health professionals’ concerns about the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, there was only a 77% increase in obesity in boys and 47% in girls. There was also a dramatic increase in overweight', said the expert from IMSS.
He said that one of the reasons for looking for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the onset of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they will receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thereby determining whether they exhibit any known excess weight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetic conditions.
The information is confidential, doctors pass it on in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, all-day sitting in front of the television and using transport rather than walking short distances.
Obesity is also caused by a large calorie intake, that is, a higher consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetic load that is the subject of this research.
There will be no asphalt in UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature.
If tiling were properly taken care of, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 spills after each rainy season in the Valle de México metropolitan area, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, who at the same time added that if the construction, construction and maintenance of asphalt were to be done, it would be necessary to repair the spills.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Exhaustions, which he delivered during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, thus creating a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time having greater mechanical resistance, ductility and resistance.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is the grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a high molecular weight called asphalts, and others with a low molecular weight called malts. Together, they give the asphalt a typical character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, the chemical engineering expert noted.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most streets in Mexico City are covered with flexible tiles, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the topmost layers is an asphalt inlay, formed by small stones poured into the asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms the insert is filled with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the tile are well distributed.
If they were modified asphalt, they would break down even better, according to a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt insert is placed the last layer called the mantle, formed by fine stone, that is, sand also poured into the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with vehicle rims, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the roadway.
Since as part of the paving will be exposed to a large load, the coat must have a sufficient thickness and must be careful of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. Especially water has a big impact on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads in and it is difficult to get out, this causes the softening of all layers of the pavement and thus the formation of debris.
He explained that during the formation of spills, the film of the casing will be destroyed first and only then the asphalt insert will be damaged. But the damage does not occur at one time, but it is a gradual process, which should be stopped at the first signs with the help of appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of debris, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tile must correspond to the load of vehicles and must be guaranteed that this load will not be exceeded.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there is still a lot of work to be done on asphalt, and research is underway. For example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries, make it easy to repair waste without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle wins the 14th title of the first multiple miss.
Valle del Cauca failed to reach the Miss Colombia crown again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the winning stage, winning a silver crown and a shearp, on the basis of which she became the new first Miss Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena (198), Giraljua (198), Mariana (198), Mariana (198), Mariana (198), Mariana (198), Mariana (198), Mariana (198), Mariana (19), Mariana (19), Mariana (19), Mariana (19), Mariana (19), Mariana (19), Mariana (19)), Mariana (19), Mariana (19), Mariana (19), Maria), Mariana (19), Maria), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria (19), Maria (19), Maria), Maria), Maria (19), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria (19), Maria), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria (19), Maria (19), Maria (19), Maria (19), Rosa (19), Maria), Maria (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Maria), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa), Maria), Rosa), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa), Maria), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa, Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa), Maria), Maria), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa (19), Maria), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Maria), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa), Rosa (19), Rosa (19), Rosa (19
A question that many ask themselves. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, who in all previous rounds has shown that she is about to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain has become the Queen Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have achieved for example Missiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which have followed the title Kolum.
One of the key factors deciding that the jury decided to name her only the First Multi-Miss is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?" posed by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Leamos literary editorial board.
The candidate replied to the question:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of culture. The book that most influenced me in my childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. This is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was not liked, on the one hand, because of the term "culturalize" and, on the other hand, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned to her.
At the end of the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The Little Prince is a wonderful book."
Another hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite's position.
Bogota journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who took all the previous awards (Gastronomical Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and Queen Mother), aroused the envy of the other candidates, stressed him afterwards.
This was evident at the first presentation of swimsuits at Hilton Beach and during the two screenings before the final coronation.
Although she shone on both, it was known that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter on Canal RCN’s “Like Home” program, believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of first multi miss confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up with the Queen’s crown.
In addition, Valle has had a rather rude attitude towards the media in recent days and it did not pay off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of their country’s social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia competition beauty is not enough on its own, there is a need to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feeling. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was noticeable on the buttocks. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which elected her Miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queen, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with ass fibrosis, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that a native of Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
Surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Valle.
The body was never her strength, and here she chose her tax.”
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the show in swimsuits, there was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo gave Melina so that she would not have to finally give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina started the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of a Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cana.
The Cali fingerprint expert went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cana".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the FARC's supreme leader: "Alfonso Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department, this week was the turn of Eliasar González, a man from Puerta Tejada who has been working in forensic research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the Chocó Town Hall, where he often had to dig through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the dead bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and, after taking the relevant courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of friction of the skin, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was to be expected.
He left for Cauca on a helicopter from Palmyra on Friday night.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies and that he suspected one of them to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigative team at the location of the body, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance. It looked completely different than in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Together with the galton magnifying glass, ink, and transplanter and light, Eliasar began comparing the dactyl records of the corpse with the records from the card.
The eye did not disappoint her: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was tasked with confirming to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón whether he was really the FARC commander-in-chief.
Searching for tracks
For the dactyloscope from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González at the press conference of the operative service against "Can" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, these people help investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they are caught, many criminals present false documents or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall in the house, because this is where the thief leaned to pull out a vault full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not meant to take prints, but in this case we could get a full hand print and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
The investigation revealed that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was indeed a murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
The CTI’s fingerprint expert explained that the objects are “cleaned using chemical or physical reactive substances.”
When they appear, a transplantor or tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or to the Registrar.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data is not recorded anywhere," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that glitters, there is no gold, not everything you touch remains traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Indifference" protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to live.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday as they tried to get back to Manhattan Square, where they were taken out in the morning, and then attempted to seize another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters crammed into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order that allows the "infuriated" to return to their homes. The second part of the movement responded to the cleanup by taking a park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
“If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through the assembly and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the “Occupy Wall Street” movement.
Bray said the "irritated" response to the camp's eviction ordered by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself had reached the courthouse, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forcible eviction of the site and allowing protesters to continue the stating.
In addition, another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the site of the fairy tale in Trinity Church, took the "indignation".
At least for an hour they managed to seize the seat, but then the police came and detained some protesters. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw that some journalists were also tied up.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site. A delegation of religious representatives has also come to express support for them and also to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to members guarding the square, sparking "some small clashes," said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement or applying "laws that were published after the siege began, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of public space and warned protesters that local laws would not allow them to return to tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally prevented the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation that detained 200 people and was approached because protesters "violated the law."
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the square to be evacuated because it became “a place where people didn’t go to protest, but to break laws and in some cases hurt others” because “some shops received threatening letters” and “neighbors were worried about the quality of their lives.”
"The early clearance was horrific and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," a spokesman for the movement said, accusing the mayor of "disrespecting freedom of expression."
Representatives of the Occupy Wall Street movement also said they plan to organize "great events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months of the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson to Represent Our Lady in Special Christmas TV Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", swimmer in "Baywatch", bunny in "Playboy", wife of one-year-old musician Tommy Lee, and now actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a TV show in which Anderson, also known from online home pornography, appears with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in the nursery.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American descent, recently acted as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's My Violent Torpedo of Truth tour.
Apart from Anderson and Peters, Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear on CTV’s special Christmas broadcast.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is coming back to life after devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the downturn that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The Tokyo government’s first estimates of material losses amounted to $300 billion, a blow that is recovering well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, the value of GDP between July and September was in such a position that it was possible to turn the page with definitive validity: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machines necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
Companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% from January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real revival of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it for reinforcement or to rebuild infrastructure, and it is about exploiting the lack of it to start from scratch.
Japan has awakened. Especially due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in spending on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma of filling
The flows were entrusted to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but at the same time a great burden for exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large tech groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results to the yen’s exchange rate in July to September.
While markets continue to besiege EU border countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
“We must be wary of the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid rise of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) clarified that most member states showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts the volatility of the world economy, has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing down.
It fell four-tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even fallen below the average, which is at the level of 100. It has reached the level of 99.13 points.
Athens is once again spreading uncertainty.
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With swift and risky margin guarantees and the uncertainty that has once again prevailed, Greece is increasingly entangled in the labyrinth leading to an exit from the major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "agreement" of the new Greek transitional government is given by the demands of Brussels rather than by the real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days given to him in his appointment will probably be short for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, has vowed no measures in advance.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the Staff Disciplinary Code and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify any doubts about his position: "We have committed to help the transitional government, but we have no longer committed to anything else."
The Speaker of the Conservatives has gone a bit far in his address to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, he stated that he will not support and will not sign any commitment regarding the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, already outraged by the impact caused by Papandreou's play with the referendum, stressed yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it will not unblock any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign a "written commitment without ambiguity and as much as possible".
Economics spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika inspectors will return to Athens "very soon" and will negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay the sixth part" of $8 billion.
The Greeks still have a long way to go.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain’s privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance".
Yesterday, Queen Sofia recalled that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind".
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely necessary" in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015.
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", stressed Queen Sophia, who hopes that the initiatives and the contribution of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better and more sustainable solutions".
"We have already achieved a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
The microloan summit should be not only a forum for discussion, but also a platform to support the "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get above the poverty line under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans has spread to Spain and other countries of the world after “the idea pioneer Muhammad Yunus went on this journey,” the Queen said, adding that it was “an act of justice and necessary recognition.”
She described the father of this tool as "an admirable idealist who has embarked on the path of fighting poverty". She got acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted directly on the spot with his lending policy.
This experience was followed by another, the first world summit in Washington and other meetings such as in Ivory Coast in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "At all these meetings, I was able to note the constant development," explained the queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, "was able to earn the title of
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by calling on participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions, thereby enabling them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity is an "ethical imperative" that must be followed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only to the ballooning period, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that microloans represent a “serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty”, and now more than ever, governments in developed countries must work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microloan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else closes the door. The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city, which "opens its gates to the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect a European president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious problems for Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but only occurred in the autumn, especially to the satisfaction of party members who consider the government's policy today towards the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians to be lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission submitted by the leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates voted against, and 10 delegates abstained.
A few-minute ovations at the end of Angela Merkel’s speech, and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the response to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the chancellor in Europe, "the time for change has come."
This could be reflected in the changes to the Lisbon Treaty allowing the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage "in order to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: Britain is opposed and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same stance.
But the direction is clear.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously lead to the strengthening of Germany’s weight.
Concerned about calming the climate inside her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but did not try to win a congress talking about "small" European states or states in trouble willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of the "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in incapacity for work?
After the support, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, December 15, to visit the Office for the Provision of Social Support, where he will deliver a speech on a theme that has been repeated since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, based on the willingness to make savings in the context of increased rigor, but not less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity to work.
First, because of budgetary savings, the government plans to impose a fourth day of incapacity on private sector employees before they start taking aid in sickness.
Clearly, without the company's consent, an employee who becomes ill would lose four days' wages, that is, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
And also measures that would be accompanied by further measures of symbolic scope: to give state employees one day of unpaid incapacity for work (until now they have no incapacity for work compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority is also launching a theme of fraud, this time focusing on malice linked to work incapacity.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will return," Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate given the truth about incapacity for work.
These have in fact been the subject of constant scrutiny since 2002 and the political push that has been bearing fruit.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008, daily allowances accounted for 5% of healthcare expenditures, with its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were maternity allowances and occupational accidents and 54% were incapacity for work, i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That is only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study by Alma Consulting Group, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that conceals certain deviations: Another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com’s job opportunities page showed that 75% of 40,000 French employees surveyed responded that they had not chosen a single day of incapacity.
Another study, this time by health insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of incapacity for work were shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are not more prone to disability than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated between 10% and 11.8% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the case of incapacity for work is only a very small part compared to black work.
When it comes to fraud, these are only on a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks aimed at incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM noted that in 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of the 285,000 carried out due to short-term failures were "unauthorized or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked incapacities longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadjusted or unjustified" were counted on 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132,000.
A total of 169 000 "unauthorised" cases per several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work in black.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tiana, author of the June report on this issue, this number would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the collection of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and therefore infinitely more than the frauds associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke to parliament and added that a hundred days of unity given to his government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
"In order to rebuild our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout budget," the head of government said in his first public speech Wednesday at the start of the debate to vote on confidence in parliament.
Implementation of the decisions adopted at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be "around 9%" of gross domestic product from now to the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Lawmakers reject new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday expressed support for the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party is not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hands for any new measures," Samaras said at a meeting with MPs for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on targets for reducing the deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary loan of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties to support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything underneath.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says commission of experts
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, death is denied to Canadians.
On palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by the idea of denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make decisions in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of a comprehensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, involving six experts working in a variety of fields including ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this option appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
In the beginning, experts quote a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of deaths in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.”
Medicalization, yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, say experts with a mandate from the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average applies to all of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this number is highest with 86% of people dying in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also checked all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons who are incompetent or disagree.
On the other hand, Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than a number of cases of these disorders at a teleconference yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are prone to euthanasia
According to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will allow end-of-life people to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia won’t mean we’re sending a message that the lives of old or disabled people are of lesser value.
As for people who practice assisted suicide, 41% of respondents feel that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in their list of recommendations that criminal law state that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requires expert doctors to be trained to respect the obligation to refuse end-of-life treatment without fear of prosecution.
On palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission demands that it be considered as euthanasia at a time when it no longer serves to alleviate physical pain and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations by other experts
Some experts in medical law have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, described the position of expert signatories of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sick at the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is more than 18 years old could ask for help committing suicide,” said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary reports yesterday.
Deschamps also emphasizes that it seems that the authors of the report have placed the autonomy of the person above all the other values that form the social thread of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and limitations."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, has particular doubts about the dates of the report regarding the absence of wrongdoing in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign.
Damascus talks about a "complot"
Syria Is Increasingly Isolated
Yesterday, supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who with the support of Russia resists them and speaks of a "complot" against his country.
Two days after suspending Syria’s membership in the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, have taken a stand in favour of President Assad’s departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "transfer power" to Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interests at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syria's political life," the king of Jordan, a neighboring country to Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation under the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is pushing an increasingly tough line.
The United States looked forward to "strengthening the consensus against Assad and the dishonest conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone" to the crackdown in Syria, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Toner.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime’s forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in gunfire and concentrated heavy machine gun shooting in the city of Jobar" in the Homs region.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was “on its way out of the crisis.”
He also reacted lively to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus' membership, which he called a "dangerous step".
Syria "does not bow," he added, reassuring that "complots against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering a "civilian protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also in favour of the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by a regime he says is "paranoid".
A new special meeting of the League is convened tomorrow in Rabat to take an opinion on the plan for resolving the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and which specifically envisaged the withdrawal of armies from cities affected by dissent and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "failed" yesterday, while China urged Syria to accept a plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding supporting any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy (country)
Monti demands time and sacrifices from Italy
Italy's next head of government Mario Monti has asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unions and employers today.
It should make up a relatively slim cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many parliamentary groups involved in the talks, said after meeting with the prime minister-designate.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a statement of confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti yesterday commented on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he is "certain that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by markets, but concerns resurfaced after the unexpected September downturn in industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should form a team comprising mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept "politics" into it.
He said he believes the new government will last until 2013, the date of the next election.
According to House Speaker Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency and with the aim of making Italy "again a strong link" to Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman said: "Even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its goal of balancing the budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Emma Marcegagli, the head of the Confindustria business union, who meets with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot meet deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, a "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, "the challenge to seriousness" and "other Italy", represents for Italy "an epochal change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
A great unknown will be the life span of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
A Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program.
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used for nuclear weapons, a US non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from this UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" over the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, which draws widely on IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by explosive method.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the center to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kyiv.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he had to work on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear data that Iran's development of the detonation system" was based "on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member reported to the agency - worked on this technology during a substantial part of his career in the country".
Anti-Muslim Offences and Crimes Increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and offences against Muslims increased by almost 50% between 2009 and 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or slightly increased.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to the 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious delinquencies.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After the decline in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes rise again,” Human Rights First said, “The increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the group’s chief executive.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these atrocities,” he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of “hate crime.”
"Hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter Is Changing and More Like Facebook
Twitter, which provides microblogging services, introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of followers, which is somewhat similar to its Facebook services.
The new “Activity” and “Name” menus make it possible to better and directly know the activities of other people who are following you or the people whose responses (“tweets”) you are following.
This lets you know whether they allow you to track posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested “in August on a small percentage of users” before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) making le bonheur des initiés, opens up a plus large public avec un maniement plus comparable à celui des Facebook grand public et réseaux.
On the network users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it takes up a lot of space and it’s too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
"Activity will help me better to follow some elements of my Twitter," <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austro-Hungarian
Entry of the golden rule on balanced budget into the Constitution
The government of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include the "golden rule" of fiscal policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction of Austria's rating by rating agencies.
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Council of Ministers in a situation where the Austrian public debt, with its 74.6%, is high above the criterion of a maximum of 60% set out in the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy or Greece.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more on interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, a Christian Democrat.
Austria thus follows the request of the euro area summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where heads of state and government have urged that by the end of 2012 the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts be recorded in the constitution or in the law.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the federal state’s public structural deficit will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal states, as well as municipalities, will have to report an equilibrium.
The goal is to get public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.
Strong Jen
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in the foreign exchange markets if they were to continue to strengthen.
"We will strike, as we did the last time, if we find too much volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, the Senate explained.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to the historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had only recently surpassed the record against the dollar since 1945.
But only since then has it been regularly supported by buyers who consider it a “safe harbor” in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar fell again below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the 105 yen symbolic bar close to the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This upsurge in Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues earned by Japanese companies from abroad when converting them into domestic currencies.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this costly yen will not kill in the egg of a fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economic power recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of households burdened by disaster.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect “Japan’s national economy.”
Japan’s Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Central Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But Hirohide Yamaguchi, the senior governor of the institution, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities Issues increased its purchases of Treasury receipts by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) and raised the ceiling of amounts devoted to purchases of various securities to flood with liquidity to 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion).
Eurozone:
Rates are rising, stocks are failing
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European stock exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index is down 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“With new tensions surrounding the returns on euro area loans that are in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to make only part of recent profits.”
“Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, an IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop, which suffered from market participants’ concerns about Europe’s ability to cope with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the exchange will continue only in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsu<0xC5><0xA1>ige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyo<0xC5><0xA1>i Investment Management.
This resumption of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o’clock, the European currency is worth $1.3570 at a 0.4% decline.
According to brokers, the currency has fallen after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday to allow countries in trouble to leave the eurozone without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the border 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in southern European countries, but also in France, continue to exacerbate the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has urged the markets to take time to rectify the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate market straitjacket as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Expecting the growth of the eurozone
Statistical figures say that France experienced economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than the expected growth of 0.3%.
The French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, INSEE, however, revised down the figures for the second quarter to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
This is the fourth quarter of the year that most worries economists.
For its part, Germany recorded growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotion, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural that an election meeting is an opportunity to think about such deposits and about the place that the energy from the core occupies.
The debate will be successful only when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will cause electricity demand to double from now until 2050, if we do not want to rid a significant proportion of the world’s population of an important part of life.
At the same time, there will be a shortage of fossil fuels in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the essential need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a topic that is currently disappearing from the ecological debate.
The accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains the only one in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
But this is not the case in Belgium, which subordinates its decision to finding some other resource capable of replacing itself, nor in Switzerland, which it considers appropriate to build only last generation power plants.
On the contrary, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to be committed to their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its fleet by one unit by rebuilding a power plant that was interrupted after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If a German model based on renewable energies is ever presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the increase in electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal-fired power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind turbines, of which it takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices 65% and 50% higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay an electricity bill 40% higher than the amount paid by French households.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and in ensuring the maintenance of industry on national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would lead to a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful declarations about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, as well as fundamentally not rise against this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Recall that our country’s energy policy has enabled the industry to build with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 consecutive jobs.
The highly exporting sector attracts a large number of small and medium-sized specialised job-creating enterprises to international markets that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the nucleus, it would sacrifice a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion a year that the country receives for exporting nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to work for 60 years while its manufacturer is scheduled to collapse?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, even if there is no devilish one.
The development of low-CO2 emission facilities, nuclear facilities and renewable energy facilities carried out by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a State Nuclear Safety Authority, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in the blood.
Fifty years later, the nuclear industry suffered three serious accidents.
The only one on Three Mile Island happened under normal operating conditions and was left without human casualties and consequences for the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concepts of the reactor and inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this crash just as it did with the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and constructors is that an EPR-type reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and paving the way for them to take a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations rule the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the overcrowding of the police, courts and administration subjected to a policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the land of human rights" which France boasts.
Recently, this was administrative harassment of foreign students, which became topical when the Minister of the Interior (see Libération of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses".
But so far it has rarely been dismantled under the angle of the economy.
It must be said that there is quite a broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
To the right, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with 2 million immigrant workers" and to the left, Michel Rocard, when in 1990 he said that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fears of the invasion of hordes of Polish plumbers on French territory were shared by both the right and the left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we are willing to give to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to trivialities, stating that joint developments will enable us to solve our “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work Synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): there is a broad consensus among economists on migration, a broad consensus on migration and a positive fall in migration.
Restricting immigration is paralyzing growth and damaging jobs.
Concerns about the impacts caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less skilled, and put pressure on them to cut their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for French employees by performing jobs in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as the surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements will lead to a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
It does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, on average, at 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, a 30-year-old immigrant will make a net contribution to public budgets (income minus expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his term of office he wished to go for the missing percentage of growth "with valued teeth".
These teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for even though it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece during the 20th century.
Some people may have believed that in order for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies, it will be enough to make an election and execute it as directly as possible.
But it is known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
General suffrage, although it is a necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can become a “instrument of oppression” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of division and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been the same since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting the mistake of a Greek yes-no referendum will have the value of a double revelation in this respect: the revelation of the necessity of a great return of political power, but also the revelation of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought of in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic camp have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
There is nothing we can achieve if we demand a series of national referendums organised as necessary and disorganized.
White exposed to a European absolutist monarch or a leap with tied legs into the emptiness of nationalist depths: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to end the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
Indeed, it is the whole of Europe bowing down to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
There is an urgent need to restore the governance of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of market governments and prepare the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is calling for a European economic government.
Come on.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order for a republic to emerge in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
A revolution of interest could not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building a more politically democratic Europe and a genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans in order to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Chip Card Fair opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones) to more than 6 billion units.
The most portable is the segment of contactless technology, which allows you to pay in public transport or handle purchases by simply zooming in on the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million sold a year earlier.
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) to reach approximately 10% of the total chip market (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in the APEC lift countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But the big chains work for two.
Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to rank a higher speed, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
“Two major French companies have committed to systematically distributing touchless bank cards to their clients in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to execute transactions.
"They're late."
"But their real boom should happen next year."
“For 2012 we estimate their worldwide sales of 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Credit Agricole Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test conducted in the city of Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 iPhone customers and employees will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Yesterday, the Société générale announced that it was preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without touching it.
Terrorist front stretches from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-standing suspicions that there are ties between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria has "gained certainty" about this.
"The way both organizations operate, and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he said.
It seems that Paris has similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help shed light on the bridges.
After being abducted by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the aftermath of the attack, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists.
The terrorist axis
Analysis of the calls carried out leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
“It’s progress, but we certainly need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo said in a statement.
In recent months, this "support" has become more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operating procedures, which from now on involve human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as the devices used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community led by Washington has put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
A Quick Success (film)
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Muhammad Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means"Western education is sin", approves the founding of the Islamic Emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has been a rapid success.
The sect is politicizing and demanding strict adherence to Islamic sharia law, while its adherents are waging a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and multiplied their attacks on police stations.
The response of the government is, as usual, the same.
The army encircles the city, resulting in 800 deaths.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its headquarters in the north.
On Christmas Day 2010, he will carry out an assassination in the city of Jos, in which 80 people are killed, followed by another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, now worries all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda has encircled the Islamic Maghreb and the games and Somalis of the Al-Shabab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck, Alain Juppé said France was in a state of emergency and was ready to "transmit all information".
Category: Presidential candidates in the world
In matters concerning China, Iran or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry exaggerate in simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating noisy statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or aid to Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the nomination of the Republican “Grand Old Party,” has threatened to challenge the Chinese in front of the World Trade Organization and accuse them of “manipulating their currency,” which is a bearish theme in America enraged by the migration of entire parts of its industry in the direction A.
Even worse, if this must involve the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated foreign policy vision, has almost shrunk to a stance that “smooths” emotions.
He called for a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is in the last place in the election estimates, remains unheard of.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in a fanfare.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll have a bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, demonstrates a shameful ignorance of documents.
Recently, he called for a sharp stance against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - obviously ignorant of the fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They are all far different than Republican candidate John McCain was in 2008, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple thoughts and still won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his apologies for Libya, and thus credit him with the label of the weak.
But the attack is not easy.
The population considers President Obama’s national security policy, which eliminated Ben Laden, rather positively.
Since Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to swelling.
And with the argument that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to resurrect its leadership, Obama hits the right place.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry of Russian gas into Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Eastern Europe directly to Russia and runs along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is now operational.
It must supply gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to properly celebrate this event.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended Tuesday the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte jointly controlled the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will flow into Western Europe each year through the first 1,224 km of pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The second pipeline, due to be completed by the end of 2012, will provide a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is equal to the total French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge construction is a victory.
Poland and the Baltic States protested strongly against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being flown through the country by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At once, these two countries are losing a bit of power: the possibility of pressuring Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that it is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, gained greater certainty in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, because the project has created rifts between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has barely managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, high-gas-consumption Western states, whose bearings are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," Fillon said at the opening ceremony of the pipeline, demonstrating at what point large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The subsea pipe is made of steel with a concrete casing to protect it from the anchorages of marine vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the time of World War II.
“For safety reasons, nearly a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffelovek, which is not interrupted anywhere on its entire length by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project managers rejected it when the Swedes were only unwilling to see the Russian state company permanently settling off their coast.
"In the event of a malfunction, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline leaks into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders, since the welding was designed to cause leakage once every 100,000 years.
The status of the pipeline from the outside is checked by a submarine robot pulled by the ship, while the inside of the pipeline is checked by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pressed with gas.
It will provide accurate information about possible deformations of metal parts in the target at a speed of 3 m/s after a full three days of travel.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest need for repair.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom remains in the lead, holding a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
The company is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased to the company for a five-year contract, which could be renewed, all of its capacity to transport gas.
“Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, no matter how much gas is actually being transported,” says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% bank loans.
The total cost of work is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment costs amounted to $240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be reimbursed, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves with a height of 4.5 meters form the gas outlet gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - brand notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to provide the joy of writing again.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily distinguishable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves, white in color, as if aged over time.
After all, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo based in Milan at the time decided to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is taking on the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used, for example, for the finishing of benches.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has returned to the popularity of an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from a secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook will capture businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of Moleskine’s notebook includes that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded people.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has almost a hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookshops and through the FNAC chain of stores to small boutiques in the centers of towns where he was able to assert his identity.
“We followed the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, through the stormy development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: the brand recently opened the exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, she also introduced new record labels reminiscent of leopards.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand is expanding to a wide range of carriers.
A success that sparked envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today is the 15th week for the employment of disabled people.
Despite the voluntaristic public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people with disabilities is even twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% vs. 9% for the entire population.
Is it overwhelming?
"No, underlines Éric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Disabled."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher."
"However, there is still much to be done."
It must be said that there are many obstacles for unemployed disabled people before they get to work.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree and out of 2.3 million university students there are only 10,000 disabled.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very prevalent: 53% for the disabled versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work and that constitute the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are still unspoken ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the managers surveyed had a "weak level of knowledge about people with disabilities" with an "excessive idea of people on a wheelchair and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, which date back to 2008, indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
“We are now at around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, which is charged with collecting fees from companies that do not comply with the law.
The evidence is the number of "fined" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What luck"
Before the French team (Bleus) challenged on Tuesday evening, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was an association between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the stage of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard simply reconciled.
Five months after his attacker’s angry gesture in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," said the French Lille player.
"As for the difference between his performances in club matches and the matches of the national team, it is the same," he said.
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my mark."
Hazard, investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, is coming to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "glow up".
The term “joy” cannot be overlooked.
Play against Bleus, whom he has encouraged since the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
Especially because opposite "they are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We were crucified right away."
"To be able to play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Leekens also kindly recalled "pride".
"Pride" fight"match - holiday".
"Pride" also states in terms of the quality of "neighbours" that France, just over a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna "again became a team of very high levels".
"Laurent Blanc did a great job," he sighed.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French in the direction of... Brazil.
“Our little Belgians are going to be big,” he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize that for the next games." Including the one against France.
Portugal is very self-confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento is optimistic about starting the barrage against Bosnia and Herzegovina (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
There was a lack of realism between the two teams.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese national football team, which has been at the helm since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is only one match left and one opponent - Bosnia.
Aware of Friday's result (0-0) in the bosnian Zenice hell, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour’s lead, but it was not able to score such a rare goal that would relieve him.
"It's a good result, but it's risky because we didn't put a goal out there."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will step forward in front of the audience, who should create a boiler there, even though the match definitely seems "very balanced", says the optimist, but wisely considering Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are fully convinced that we can have the top," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” Carlos Queiroz’s successor said.
The indecisive Friday game in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
A tie can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but it’s risky because we didn’t score a goal out there,” Bento said.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities," he added.
Just like in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the start so that "they don't have time to think".
Good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
