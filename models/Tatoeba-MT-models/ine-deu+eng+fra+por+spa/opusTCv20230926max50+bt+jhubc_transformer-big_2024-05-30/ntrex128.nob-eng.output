Welsh MPs don't want to appear as "muppies"
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, today known as AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear this may lead to ridicule.
A Labour representative explained his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means “dusted”, and pwp means “asshole”.
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", which in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way to the letter U in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members themselves who have the final say in what name they should be mentioned.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing that showed general support for renaming the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the representatives, the Commission supported the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
Apparently, the representatives are proposing other options, but getting all parties to come to an agreement could lead to a heads-up for parliamentary president Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a bill for the name change over the next couple of weeks.
The legislation surrounding the reform will include other changes in the way the National Assembly works, including rules for the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the right to vote on what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the northern neighbor’s name constitutes a claim to their territory, and on several occasions has opposed the country’s applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Clocks Silence – Harlem's Cliffs Slow
“The old ones I spoke with told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“Now there are none of the parts.”
He said the abandonment of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize with each other in other ways” these days, he says.
“Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. “Sooner or later they are back at the starting point.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining shelters.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore will only accelerate the day when these churches will have to close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both creeks were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street—one of Harlem's main dealers—because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused major damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for the reconstruction, they purchased a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared the carillon to be "the church bells of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated interaction between architects and contractors, some of whom are hired by the church's lay leadership and others by the diocese.
The church council – the church’s leadership, made up of lay people – wrote to the diocese in July about its concern that the diocese would “try to impose the costs” on the church council, despite the fact that the church council had not been involved in the initiation of the architects or contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Thirteen-year-old shark hurts at lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought the boy was shouting out of enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but he eventually realized that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His whole collarbone was ripped up,” says Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Bathing guard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said the victim suffered serious injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's has plans to make its take on the UK beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty care shelves, staffed by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores across the country as part of a strong intake in the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which is experiencing steady growth while sales figures for clothing and home items fall. If the attempt proves successful, the concept will expand to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s attempt to find a new application for the space that was previously used for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s has said it will double the number of beauty products it offers to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also be better suited to featured brand areas, just like in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique makeup brand with mainly vegan products, as there is increasing demand for this among younger customers.
The fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will also test sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the other will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
E-commerce and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that sales will eventually resemble more and more a grocery store, as the supermarket takes on the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to upgrade the departments of beauty care and pharmacy products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was discontinued after a dispute over the distribution of supermarket pharmacy income.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 store pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and design of beauty care shelves to create more inviting environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be ready to provide advice and help.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting environment and practical locations make us now a beauty care competitor that represents a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones Is 'Raging' After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessory label, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby, 37, who is the host of This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand at the last second to focus on her own new gold-plated contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “raged” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the television’s goldenie admitted that her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – mean she no longer has time left for their clothing and accessories brand, Truely.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security for the next few decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has decided to leave.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a department store full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow that are now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the This Morning programme manager, who is among Britain’s most popular stars, could cost the company several million pounds due to large investments in products such as cushions and lights, fashion and cosplay, as well as a potential delay in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin who hosts the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
“We fell in love, and then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment some would consider a “little presidential” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I have not given away anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big mess on the road to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have come to a halt.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a "corresponding response" from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead, the United States still has sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for an assembly of his constituents.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his work to improve relations with Kim has yielded positive results, such as halting missile tests, helping to release hostages and getting the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia devastate an island and kill hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign nonprofits were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok residents had lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Save the Children is now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure if foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Crisis Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Considering the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is terribly ill-prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Lights to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, even if a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the death toll.
Even under the best circumstances, traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made an upgrade of Indonesia’s failing infrastructure a main point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which is due for re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge late in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before sending it to the longest corner.
The attempt went high above the box as the ball fell towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually went over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq are always pushing the ball forward as well as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touch the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it further.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker sent a pass with the heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half lap.
Kovacic made a quick pass to the midfielder.
He then fired a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the European Men's Football League in London at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia reaches 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's crisis management agency said early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5 iron that hit the land on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation is underway after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a stab wound at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would like to ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to contact them – they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A spokesman for the police confirmed that the deceased woman was residing in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and police have said they are working to inform the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was silent when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take several hours for them to get back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared at the scene.
She says “it’s so terrible” over and over again.
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars stood behind the lock, while a third car stood just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the lockdown and supervised the apartment complex.
Data subjects are asked to send an instant message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, by referring to “log 247” as of September 30.
The Parliament statue of Cromwell is the last memorial to be drawn into the quarrel about “rewriting history”
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England’s cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick’s publishing as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside Westminster Palace would also become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century views and is part of the historiography of a man many believe still deserves to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps later in the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against pressure from outside – in his day, of course, there was talk of the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, who is only mentioned by the surname "Yuan", was found dead and covered with blood from a ruptured artery near a binge at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He allegedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pig trail was open.
He said inside the pork path there was a big bug with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kg pig had killed the man.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and ill-treated,” the cousin, mentioned by the surname Wu, explained in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
While police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and market leadership are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
This is not the first time a pig has been reported to have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, inflicting serious injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious ... they try not to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.”
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rains on her journey through northern Mexico and southwestern USA over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 05:00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern United States.
Pink will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical moisture and the approaching fog will lead to widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest for the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, liquid debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will result in rainfall rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, especially areas in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rainfall.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause river valleys to turn into broad, bubbling rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local wind gusts that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching footprint will cause local heavy rains for parts of the coastline along Southern California.
Total rainfall above 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid debris and fast, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area’s first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rains spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and persist throughout Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout Central America on Sunday.
There will be nearly 11 degrees difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, sustained summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are likely to get a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twenties from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern U.S.
New York City could reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern U.S. will most likely have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, spread over six TV networks, saw Thursday’s gripping testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political quarrel continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday’s big surprise at the last second, when it emerged that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewer numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewers were not immediately available for other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring office workers.
To give some perspective, this number of viewers corresponds to the final game of the American Football Championship or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with an average viewership of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was still a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican’s office made a statement saying he was going to vote in Kavanaugh’s favor, and Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a court committee meeting as protesters screamed and shouted at him.
He stood with his gaze lowered for several minutes while being scolded, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling our country the truth?”
He was told that “you have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office had made a statement, saying as the elevator doors closed he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all of the hearing directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be passed to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do so if the FBI investigated the accusations against the candidate within the next week, which the Democratic minority has urged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after speaking with Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of 'political game' over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU of “political play” with Britain’s future and undermining the nation’s interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, pressed alongside her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called “Chequers” plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “absolutely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and charged with intentional murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between the Sims and Simpsons, and according to police, the Sims lost their glasses during the basketball game.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner published a preliminary report on Friday, stating the cause of death as a gunshot wound in the head and through the throat.
The police thanked Louisiana State Police's task force for gathering refugees, the state police lab, Southern University police and locals for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU sports manager Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police force for their “hard work and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
“This is what we fear all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano splashes ash over Mexico City
The ash that erupts from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s public agency for crisis prevention, warned Mexico’s population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within one day.
The agency monitored several cases of bubbling and shaking.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police, while thousands took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists were held back by riot police, bombing them with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handcuffs also broke out later in the day when police used batons to limit fighting.
For hours, independence protesters stood shouting “Never forget, never forgive”, face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions are still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming overcrowding for secession, but it was poor attendance because the vote was boycotted by most who were against the liberation.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to halt the polls held at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets overnight to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, however, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist prosthesis with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to get a voice, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have struggled to keep the pressure up this year, after many of their well-known leaders have travelled in self-imposed exile or are in detention while awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used her phone to film the protest to support police, said the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned in anticipation of a trial since late last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“To stand for election as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and regression from democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armrest may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Advanced Livinston stunned the Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager for the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be decisive, and Gary Holt's side is now equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won the Premier League away game this season and is set to play against the Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, the Rangers will play a home game against Rapid Vienna in the Europaliga on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, has remained undefeated through six games in the division. Head coach Holt has not yet lost a game after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against its sluggish guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kicked further after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for their guests at deadball.
And that’s how the ultimate goal came to be.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers had had the ball pretty much all the time, but the home team's defense had proven to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos scored a close score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a wide short pass.
Crossings constantly entered the Livingston box and were constantly rescued, while two penalties – once after Halkett’s protest against replacement Glenn Middleton, and once at hand – were overlooked.
“Fenomenal” from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The playing style and crew have barely changed since they got to the top again, but Holt should have a lot of credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a hugely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not have my inspiration.
Although they have at times been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was labs – they only made it to the home team’s halfway point once – and it was a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiles and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the NATO allies.
There have been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also voiced their concerns, criticizing both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford crash: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist is killed in a collision with a passenger car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy veil in Deptford southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The crash comes just a month after a cyclist died in a collision where the driver escaped from the scene on Childrens Street, about a mile from Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and notify the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus stops are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured in riots
Six prison officers have been injured in an incident at a high-security men's prison, according to the prison authorities.
Riots erupted at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized Tornado officers have been recruited to handle the incident, which involves eight inmates and is limited to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind bars and beatings.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were summoned to handle a serious incident in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
That’s why Arizona is hit by a tropical low pressure, but that’s exactly what is likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining force moves through the desert areas in the southwest and brings flooding danger.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will begin late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of rainfall, with up to 15 cm in some locations in Mongolon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will likely get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of danger of flooding, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be beneficial, since the southwestern U.S. is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, which is the second highest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind speed of 137 km, is located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving at 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm power on Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and bring great flooding danger.
“Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with opportunities for up to 25 cm of rainfall,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
“The main danger expected of Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
This precipitation is expected to produce life-threatening floods and liquid debris and rapid in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 04:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is expected to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incident to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered under the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered under the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault against her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his indictment during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, skilled and brave” Kavanaugh was on that day.
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of our time’s most skilled lawyers, with impeccable vanity in public service,” he told an assembly of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president discreetly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump said Democrats aim to “resist and prevent.”
The Senate's first midterm vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant to a leader within the Republican party told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian landslide and tsunami, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves rushing to the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six-metre-high waves roared into land around sunset, destroyed everything in its path and led many to drowning death.
The tsunami came as a result of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami struck yesterday, people were still running activities on the beach, didn’t immediately escape and ended up as victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s Bureau of Crisis Management (BNBP) said at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it carried cars, logs and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.”
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Emergency Management Department showed many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the power from Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and injuries could be the country's larger coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely crippled, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building shouts desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passers-by on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes rushing towards the beach, tearing down buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has hampered communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The military has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's awful.
World Vision staff from Donggala have made their way safely to the center of Palu, where they have sought shelter under the tarpaulin tent in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed major destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses,” he said.
It's awful.
As relief organizations began the bleak preparations to deliver emergency aid, some complained that foreign relief workers with a lot of expertise were denied travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘Okay, this is a national disaster’ we can open the borders to international aid, but the situation has not received any status yet.”
As the sun sets over Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that illuminate the bleak news picture after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued after spending two days trapped under rubble with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those trapped in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should carry,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the practitioners attending the beach festival on Palu.
But the messages only led to gray check marks, rather than a couple of blue check marks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who filled an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who "runned up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creature formerly known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she canceled on "emotional grounds," according to the series' creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s incumbent president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when leftist student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number one in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough,” Lee said.
“Double financial support could double the chance that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence will come from the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that defeated America's best Othello player, and later became a head of Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese division.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held, to help find the next generation of smart heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that steals the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired smart heads from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive offers of residence permits automatically,” he said.
China’s next-generation artificial intelligence development plan was launched in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, involving partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia” to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes the northern neighbor’s name constitutes a claim to Greek territory, and has vetoed their inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts whether the attendance will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you for NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for us all,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Even if it is not legally binding, it will probably be decisive, because a large enough number of Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the result of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said it had not received any reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the attendance was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
“We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we will be registered with our heads raised, not let in the back,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He says that a “yes” answer will be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of eligible voters will attend the referendum – this is lower than the required attendance.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of blacks plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political hurdle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvering past Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crushed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2–0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran around with three Brighton defenders before getting out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him going to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
He was lucky to score a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League match.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball placed inside the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the dead line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer is a spoiler for the Rockies.
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
Still, Scherzer hopes to be on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in NL West.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
Even if we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will most likely be the highest level of play I will be able to play this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to take Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president discreetly referred to the situation around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not a participant, but I’m a participant. That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates,” he said.
“You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power back at all costs, and you will see the triviality and the wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to override to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, aim to “resist and prevent.”
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "since they're mean and ugly and dishonest."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, after which the audience bowed out loud.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I’m expecting one—it was very bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don’t tolerate people who say their opinion.
When momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a long line of Labour MPs to be told that we are not welcome just because we say what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was to be censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
About how important it is to have responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe – ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, more friendly” politics has long been forgotten, if at all it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the Party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought I shared many political positions with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never agreed with before, whether they were about the security of the nation or the EU’s internal market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – I receive a wealth of ugly messages on social media that demand that I be dismissed, condemn center politics and tell me I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And it’s not just me who has experienced this.
I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they encounter an ocean of gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but they never let themselves be pampered.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross discrimination has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to all, and every motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral divisions the party becomes narrower.
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years where I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better”.
But that’s not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the Thatcher government’s negligence that had made my classroom in the public school I attended literally fall apart, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and minister of government.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have misunderstood my political attitudes or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representative proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that as the country rages on our way to a Brexit that will harm private individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot grasp and understand the desire to waste my time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to the Nottingham Momentum – it’s to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of dismissal or political uncompromising will prevent me from doing what I think is best for your interests.
Chris Leslie is the Parliamentary Representative for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result a bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they had that led the home team to lose the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be happy.
“We’ve been challenged in our fights so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “All the glory to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, with a goal kick from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the position, and Jason Baggot made an attempt without a goal kick.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick before he, just before the break, scored and scored a solo attempt to change the position to 17–5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This resulted in a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on a stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr increased management even more by an attempt by Stafford McDowell, with a goal from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt by Bruce Colvine without a goal hit, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown by pitching behind the advancing Ayr Maule.
Climo scored a goal, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe scored David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flank Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
The Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be on the way into the catering industry – it was recently discovered that he has been named as the CEO of a restaurant company with grants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, for which he writes scripts and plays alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The dove has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “lively restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rig-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.”
The entire inland state of Bolivia still has a fresh memory of the coastline it lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, and the country longs to be able to sail once again on the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for decades, with Bolivia awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the drive, the spirit of community and peace of mind, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on the big screen in many different places in the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of sporadic negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a separate outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also staked heavily on Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia’s side, and that very little would change if it did.
The UN body, like the team in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean lands, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The ruling by the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the last arguments were heard, saying the case was “not complicated,” according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than advancing the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have actually made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
She believes that Morales’ antagonistic rhetoric has squandered any remaining goodwill on Chile’s side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia will offer “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “stop 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, has used the maritime situation as a political cover-up.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
“The feeling is an opportunity to see what we have to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if they cannot rely on US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep the promises it made during a meeting between the leaders of the two conflicting countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to launch the locked-in nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “dream of desire” that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance is a statement that ends the Korean War will ever force North Korea to its knees.
The U.S. government is skeptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to release an arsenal it probably sees as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headwear, which is heading towards a clothing store near you
If you want some great additions to your hat collection or completely hide from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of odd, oversized headwear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the fashion lions at the fashion outlet in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most striking garment was an excessively beige hat decorated with a feather-like broad brake that drowned the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled watermelon, a wizard’s hat, or even a pineapple, but they are not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had re-stitched lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation resembled diving gear, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you’re looking for even more big fashion accessories, then you’re in luck.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be heading towards a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a half-meter-wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another big creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The orange raffle bag, bordered with raffle fringes and complemented by a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the fashion show in Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such an impact it will be difficult to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland’s free schools are constantly exhibiting academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with another year of outstanding exam results. These are underpinned by individual and joint success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and in demand elective at schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the words hit his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we see that language is at the top of the table with the highest pass percentages from free schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the exam grade A.
The data, collected from 74 member schools of the Free School Council, showed that 72 percent of students received the exam grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subject choices are now valued at the same level as real-life subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for free schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 percent of the reasons employers stated to have difficulty in occupying a vacancy could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language education is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teach in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered most valuable to the UK on the way towards 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a choice of languages to choose from at free schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish Free Schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
In today’s global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still crucial to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered as “international communication skills”.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction for Scotland’s youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to watch LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still unclear.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season matches at this stage of my career,” he said.
Time of Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President starts a series of election rallyes tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five planned public meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the verification vote for his elected Supreme Court candidate has been put on hold, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voters go to polls in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump’s public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss weekly hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote has been put on hold for up to a week as the FBI investigates the case.
The main goal of all these popular rallies is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five popular gatherings over the next few weeks aim to “incite volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move toward a busy campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
This evening’s public gathering, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh Press,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who lags behind in polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science expert at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep their faith as they enter Sunday’s singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup of the year needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely fictional sports concept, yet something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now it's four, so we're probably carrying it with us as a little momentum," Spieth said as he left the field for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead by four points and there are 12 more to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel like they’ve got some wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, leading by example.
The deep celebratory screams grew higher as his round continued, and sank to a crucial putting to raise the match to tie as he and Thomas lay two by two.
His putting, which won them the match of 15, was met with a similar shout – of the kind that shows he still does not believe that the American team is chanceless.
“We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is undoubtedly Ryder Cup’s big success story.
Europe’s unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and don’t set a foot wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided Bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s biggest competitors, and there are no other players the audience will also see secure a European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each hole.
It is still too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson joined Sergio Garcia, the fourballs hero of the morning, when he was partnered with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede were so far behind that they did not have a chance to take the lead again.
On Sunday, there is no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the fighting spirit of some, especially in the United States, have been missing.
Europe lead 10-6 at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the Ryder Cup last day, after completing Sunday’s fourballs and foursomes games with 10–6 lead against the United States.
Brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins against a defeated Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European side, fighting to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America’s unfortunate side in the morning fourballs and won the series 3–1.
The U.S. gave more resistance in the foursomes and won two matches, but they were unable to recapture any of the lead.
Jim Furyk's side must score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have been nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only pair to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they worked seamlessly together to beat defeated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who stuck through two games on Saturday, glimpsed occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in the foursomes and achieved a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything as they wanted on this hot day with light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fought 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a team has managed to catch up after a four-point lead at the start of the singles game, but as current holders, only Furyk's side needs to score a draw to keep the trophy.
But having been second best for two days, it does not seem that they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will not agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened distrust of the United States and that the country would in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual general assembly that North Korea has implemented “significant benevolent measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We haven’t seen a similar response from the United States,” he said.
Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a gradual nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea is rewarded for gradual stages of disarmament, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, in which Kim vowed to work against “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first', raising pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can force us to kneel is a dream for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader stressed before the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party in this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as firm as it is.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland U.S. with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the UN this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-armed.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, saying, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be enforced vigorously and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to curb funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, after which he said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that they had made progress, but only hours after North Korea accused him of making “small claims.”
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile area as well as a nuclear weapons facility if the U.S. took “equivalent action.”
He said Kim had said that these “equivalent measures” he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses in Getting Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by tackling the growing inculturation of caffeinated drinks as fuel.
One academic found that students at the world’s best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why has no one said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students how important it is to have good sleep habits in order to be able to perform academically and sportively, and for the general condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to start the course after seeing students suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this is not going to change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risks of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to pee all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being an increasing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, leading to a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the professor’s classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course that was available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master’s students to take a similar study program before enrolling in the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students put on an alarm for when to go to bed as well as for when to get up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Goals of Menge beat Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Menga's goal beat Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to get their first win since February's 4–1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and since left his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers were never able to compensate.
The Rangers now drop to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble in the yeast for the Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown from the away audience.
Gerrard made eight swaps on the team, sweeping past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
The Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target.
The Rangers took control, but it looked as if their game relied more on hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty kick after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson declined this.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Liv’s opening in the 34th minute may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player switch gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett catching up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the final round, but McGregor stood up to Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late penalty kick as he got into conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
The Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science ever since, and also became part of popular culture through the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter; it finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Let’s say it makes sound now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave the name to, lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and are then injected into the patient again.
A vaccine under trial has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of different cancers,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and "trained" to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came up with fierce defense of Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was bullied in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a gruesome performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he pushed against the Democrats and reiterated that he supported Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person and then he says, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
“If I was afraid of racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording by West was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the public that he heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headwear.
“They bullied me.
They said, “Don’t go out there wearing that hat.”
They bullied me!
And then they said I don’t understand what reality is,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want me to see what reality is?” he said, saying that he should “put on my Superman cloak, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love.”
His comments were bent at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL looked embarrassed, reported Variety, where a staff member said: "The whole studio was dead-end."
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR standing against the masses.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just “who he is and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) which I think he cultivates and spits out ideologies that are harmful to society.
He's free.
We are, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbed at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendants are expected to be presented to the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The case will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington pushes for 'poisonous masculinity'
Kit Harington is known from the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles in movies often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something had gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very interested in the subject.
“I’m pretty much worried about it right now – where did masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may be partly to blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to its highly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is congenital and what is taught?
What is conveyed on TV and on the street, what is it that makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate exactly this side of being a man?
I think that’s one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any predecessor or successor to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is “finished with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will play the lead in a re-recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so that way something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says a health representative.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way is now nearing zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the infection is due to inadequate protection during sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised public access to HIV medicine as part of a move to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked data on Republican senators, whispers of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
House Speaker Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insured by the allegations was put forward by “ultraconservative” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the charges of abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was tracked to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and a lie,” Waters continued.
“The members of my staff – whose identities, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a regular lie.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized online, among others by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They must not go in defense.
They must not question the motives of the prosecution.
They need to be calm and understanding.”
Fleischer compared Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to eliminate Waters in the midterm elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified “relevant authorities and police of these false allegations.”
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and that they are held responsible for all actions that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit hints in all new films with a British glance and it seems to be relevant for this revival of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfied about how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and rubber face has been renewed his license to mess it up for the second time – his name says more than anything that he is a clear and comical figure intended for territories with non-English speaking cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a dashing Mr Bean, and a portion of that guy who contributes a single note to the firefighter-themed musical feature during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There are some great moments in the recent Johnny English journey.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades cut off his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy comes to fruition, but the humor feels rather bloody and strangely redundant, especially now that the “serious” brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are willingly stripped of comedy.
Humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s fades are not as inventive and pointed as Mr Bean’s silent film loops.
The current premise is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the dismay of the guarding agent – an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a prime minister, a pompous and depressed figure already undergoing a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this sort of Teresa-May role, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been revealed, she must bring in some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snob establishment, but provides unofficial teaching in secret intelligence. There are some funny sequences here, when English offers a rocka academy for spy activity.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, splintered with a submarine commander, a hysterical top-class lady role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin's style of messing everything up on quests for the queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cyber problems: the insidious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey with farsighted leaps: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a striking French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes the sheer anarchy as he attempts to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so lovable and noisy it is so there is a lot of resemblance to children's TV with the whole thing.
Quite mediocre, everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies plans to allow British workers to work four days a week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would give the British a four-day working week – but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to spend savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra weekday off.
This will mean that employees will get a three-day weekend, while at the same time receiving the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to let the pendulum swing for the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week is not the party’s policy and is not something that is considered by the party.”
Labour Finance Spokesman John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profitors” of public service providers.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not getting back the entire stake because a Labour government can make “deductions” on the basis of perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors and create employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity to companies in the private sector to the employees, who can receive an annual dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Tell '60 Minutes' About FBI Investigation of Kavanaugh Could Make They Change Their Minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview sent on Sunday, Scott Pelley’s correspondent in “60 Minutes” asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the start of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, oblique, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
“I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and if so, it must have been an astonishing finding,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett vigorously denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she mentioned could confirm that.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to the fight against poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will have thousands of people flocking to the large lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by making more people work actively against poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a variety of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, taking a phone call or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – that people feel they are making a big contribution by signing a signature campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from their followers, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have helped make world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the UK that will “help children unleash their full potential,” and pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy as ‘Blocked’ to Prevent Russian Energy Exports
Washington can “if necessary” resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate about energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
“The U.S. has through the Navy the ability to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocks to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that profiles itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, noting that they are far from equal.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as “one trick pony” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
Employees in the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project The Northern European Gas Pipeline 2, which Trump said made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion gas pipeline, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of fraudulent competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, BDI, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have major problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” about her 2020 presidential nomination, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "reflect seriously" whether she would run for president after the midterm elections.
During a vote meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would stand.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix the chess government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
"After November 6th, I'm going to seriously think about whether I'm going to run for president."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump at the polls, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried all the way to the margins about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not be silent, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% were against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin’s PTSD during Trump’s polls
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after coming home, I have in common with other families experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with them,” she told the audience at a Donald Trump election event in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home and they wonder if this is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, clamping down on a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla police.
18 states and D.C. support trial of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal trial of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented an orientation from amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that her partner “and his violent gang member sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Court that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy “disregards many decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle,” the orientation from amicus curiae said.
The lawyers further argued in the briefing that the policies that deny immigrants access are damaging the U.S. economy and say they are highly likely to become entrepreneurs and “contribute with the necessary workforce.”
Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in the June 11 announcement on the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very exciting,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the congested city of Palu.
“You see ambulances picking up the dead.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents could be seen coming to damaged homes and leaking through damaged water assets in an attempt to rescue what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were injured in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palus Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to be safe.
I was squeezed by the wall that was crumbling, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Harassment’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that embellished the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the attachment China Daily paid to break into the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s punitive tariffs early in the trade war were expected to hit export companies in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader’s post in Sunday’s Des Moines Register: “China is now stepping up harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is harnessing the freedom of expression and open press we enjoy in America to put a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing, you won’t find many dissenting opinions and won’t experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers rejected the offer to publish” his article, although he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare off female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh fade, warns analysts
As many top Republican politicians support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received multiple allegations of sexual assault directed at him, analysts warn that they will get a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The sentiments around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move on with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes’ (R-Arizona) proposal for a last-second FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget yesterday’s events – they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the hallways of the Senate when the Republicans who control the judiciary committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among women uncertain voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts thought there would be a counter-reaction if Republicans forced through the appointment.
“This has become a blissful mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh gets in – it’s also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group promoting Democratic candidates, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided over who they should believe in following Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41% of respondents were fully or quite convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were fully or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38% said they were fully or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
The FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly abused her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal is “world domination”.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start-up.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data store online” or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal data store online is that it is entirely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data”.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide the resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely re-calculate overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new grid built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War
The only priest in the English Church to be awarded a Victorian Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann was awarded the honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a “great symbolism” that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Water led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29 – “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he crashed into the line of fire and led the line "with great courage" ahead before storming a field cannon on his own and knocking out three of the divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also dropped a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to play a part in the parade," adding: "The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people."
MMA fans were up all night to watch the martial arts program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that you’ve been up all night watching the packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you don’t get to watch the main game.
The San Jose participant made it through 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, viewers in the UK were sitting moaning when the picture suddenly showed Peppa Pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the game.
A supporter described the transition to the children’s program on Twitter as “a kind of sick joke.”
“It’s government regulation that it’s not appropriate to broadcast such programs at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work on the broadcast schedule to include viewers in Britain in the future.
“I think we can figure it out for the rematch,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday your time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me - when we switched over, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly kind.
We tried to fix it and thought it was a technical failure.
But that wasn’t it, it was a matter of authority.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five games – which we usually send – and we tried to stretch far for the fans, but tipped over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until high school that he realized “he wasn’t like everyone else.”
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular program manager for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, will be gone for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared somewhat lost on Laverne's first show, saying he felt "less valuable" than anyone he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, it is these feelings of inferiority and difference that have been the real motivation and have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he “was something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time Olympic bronze winner and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels he is lucky who can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope”.
The three-time World Champion said that falling in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about having to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than a gold medal in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept him to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the first row,” he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that’s what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics, the best feeling I’ve ever had,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song – Proud by Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the run-up to the Olympics and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs goes on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formsweak Mickelson taken out for the Ryder Cup golf tournament on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to get in shape if it is not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday’s fourball and foursome matches.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he had so often been for the U.S., the five-time major winner divides the day between being a healer and working on his game on the rank in the hope of correcting what is scorching.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National track, where the long rough area constantly punishes misguided strikes.
And if the track itself is not scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, meets the very British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s games could turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has great self-confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed so much to these teams earlier, and this week.
I didn’t think he was going to play two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how it ended, and that’s how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, and he likes to mess with others, and he’s a great guy to have in the storage room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week as well, and it was fun to watch.
He’s giving more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows his great leadership could soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entrance to the last-day singles game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but won with the least possible margin, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You constantly remind yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only barely,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You will give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that is where the focus lies.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn is very pleased with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t have done better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual achievements that are at the center, and it’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, your achievements as a golfer are tested to the fullest.
That’s the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great upheavals of the last day. He was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the "miracle at Medinah".
I remember every damn word of it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had devastated his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, which we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We arrange our setup then and send the people out the way we feel. You know, we’re trying to create something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the player order.
“I’m betting on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his choice of singles players.
Germany's new warships delayed once again
The latest German navy frigate was supposed to be completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War days, but it won’t happen until early next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the pilot ship of the brand new frigates in the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been handed over to the navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the navy back in 2007 will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
Continuous delays mean, however, that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be outdated before they are put into service, Die Zeit reports.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important since Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion – from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of fresh warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's defence committee, confirmed that the navy is actually "going empty for useful ships".
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were obsolete, but no new ships arrived.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Württemberg class could be used by the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret lives of bats
New research conducted at a country estate in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help shape future conservation measures.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown moose and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat screams and which species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be included in the decision on what measures to implement, such as planting pastures and how best to take care of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects brood sites and habitat restriction.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with flypaper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from house cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more need for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road as they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, mapping of brood sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only own flagge reserve at Threave Land Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten flagge species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have a perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of mapping bats before maintenance is carried out on a property since the unintentional destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their breeding sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help with the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we simply don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as “fake news” and says people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 in arrears for keeping a close eye on the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the allegations as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says five times the winner of the Ballon d’Or into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving up my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” the footballer adds with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable portrayal of suspicions in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says the footballer will claim compensation for “reputational damages to an extent equivalent to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents presented to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good person" who was betrayed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later they made settlements outside the court because she was "save for revenge" and was also concerned about "being publicly hanged".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to set aside the settlement because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, moving this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'will mourn forever' for losing car manufacturers
Britain “will mourn forever” if it loses its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily halt production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delayed border crossing in the event of a no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, I think we will see production at our factory stop,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal as to how trade across borders will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will shut down the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern revolves around what automakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the basis of “order as needed” and it arrives parts every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a stay at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day’s inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further contacts with the EU is “precisely geared to avoid such border checks.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy success in the moment, but that we seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that increased costs in the long term would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience indicates that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s fateful meeting with Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein may be “deferred for another week” as the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump aides and Russia, as well as possible obstruction of judicial exercise by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will dismiss the deputy justice minister, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has for many months been hovering under speculation in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording conversations with Trump and attempting to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the allegations.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was resigning voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further postponing a full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s delay because of everything that is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always busy keeping the press up to date.”
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Program host Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to reluctance to “self-goodness” of TV reporters, although she added: “I do not disagree with the fact that they are self-good.”
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
“The president is doing more rounds of questions than any previous president,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We’re trying to get it done often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in the last few weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open gatherings or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, as he made a solo run and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was to leave the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have taken place through the summer and are expected to land on a solution by the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each individual employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond add valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of healthcare for the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday’s 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
"He came out on the sidelines and kind of just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is no information on the type/amplitude of the damage yet” and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transitioning from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he finished the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters
The document fee increase will be collected from those who do not pay tax in the UK
Experts in the Treasury Department expect it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters with a promise to offer more affordable housing and frame high-income groups.
The document fee increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The additional money will strengthen the government’s efforts to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate that was introduced two years ago on housing number two and housing purchases for rent – can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot inside the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused major construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, demanding that Theresa May have to reject quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing policy.”
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a startling array of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unjustified eviction.
He also wants to give municipal governments more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland”
Sunderland’s boss, Jack Ross, says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scott is delighted with the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-cap and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland on Hampden as a child, and there’s always something that pulls me back.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeeded in the club management.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at the moment will be measured by whether I can get the club back in the Premier League.”
From the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’ll probably only consider myself successful here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in the leadership for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month brief appearance in Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from downhill to third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of downhill to win the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real roadblock,” he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did it well, created me a reasonable income from it and experienced some nice highlights.
Soccer can be tough.
There are a lot of things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I’m progressing through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management feels absolutely right to me.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable thing I’ve ever known in my adult life.”

Perfect time for a half-liter is 17.30 on Saturdays, shows survey
The summer heatwave has strengthened revenues for Britain’s heavily pressed pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7% increase in sales in July – while revenues for restaurants fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who summarized the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup led to a similar pattern in July as the previous month in June, when pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The drop of 1.8% in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than that of restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% that month, with food service declining by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM hotel and restaurant analyst, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social events are still the most important factors in terms of turnover in the outdoor market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a fall of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide a long-awaited respite.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in rollouts of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry revenue controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the UK, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some are only 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, research shows.
A survey of 20,000 high school students uncovered pages of “fake Insta.”
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being shared.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they show their parents.
One in five children – some are only 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep hidden from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to image-sharing sites on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being shared.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC for Private Schools, revealed that 40% of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It is frightening that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am excited to serve as a voice for athletes and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding the sport in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has a total of four Olympic gold medals. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after suffering a transient ischemic attack, she was unable to walk.
She tweeted: “A month ago today I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I want to recover and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m totally good again and I’ve learned to walk again, and today I’m doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows splits opinion online
A breast pumping company has split opinion online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump to be worn tightly against the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirtatious music-inspired video ad to showcase the freedom the new pump provides to active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to a song with the following lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you didn't realize it, this is not jure, it's my tits."
The choir continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I’m feeding my babies, pumping it out, pumping it out, milking my bowls.”
The ad, published on the company’s Facebook page, has, however, created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many say it beautifully paints the “atrocities” in the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “For an unsuccessful ad.”
A woman admitted that she found the song “incredibly funny.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would love to have one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and has a nice place in a breastfeeding bra, allowing women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all the challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved to a Tent Camp at the Texas Border Secretly
The number of detained migrant children has gone up even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have themselves been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid of destroying their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household would have to file fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying to be supporters of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Almost 80% of the people who are either supporters or members of the family of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people,” says Albence.
The officers are trying to deal with the children faster and introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of being arrested, rather than for 60 days as was the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be presented via videoconferencing rather than appearing in person to bring their case for a residence permit to an immigration judge.
Those who are considered as unqualified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can amplify traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were staying illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of combating terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions are fleeing.
He said that Damascus will continue to “lead this sacred struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence.”
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational flight” that is causing the refugees to stay away.
“We have approached the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing what is actually a purely humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the rebels’ last major defensive position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem made conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump Wants to Win Another Period
According to that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, federal courts and scandals put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers for best broadcast time has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable viewership with as many as 3.5 million viewers on evenings of major news events.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don’t understand anything,” Neal Baer, ABC’s director of the drama Designated Survivor, said of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, “Because he makes me laugh.”
There is an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course – unlike anything else on TV – the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Cancellation is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened human being when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of “deep dive in background fabric” for the book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s leather jacket with ostrich feather worth $15,000 (“a garment packed with hybris, Daniel’s colorful eh, beato an hybris,” said Trump.
I don’t want to watch Super Mario the same way anymore.
“Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s varying cast and daily twist on the plot.
You can't miss one episode or you'll be hanged.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27°C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged in and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t break free, not when Brett Kavanaugh is scheduled to meet the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the U.S. Supreme Court is at stake.
“I remember when we made all those crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a flow of money after a change in a congressional district that ended in two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly redesignated suburban district of Pittsburg competes with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb faces another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which greatly overlaps the new 17th District.
The map was re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were an unconstitutional manipulation of electoral districts in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign funding between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely followed supplementary election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little leadership.
US considers punitive measures against El Salvador for support to China, then withdraws threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” the ministry’s spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, halting all plans for punitive measures against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now set to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next nail in the coffin could be Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of law enforcement, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly expanding the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, amid preparations to meet voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not mean to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be choices made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had risen up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such tipping points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or hindered.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the rough since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret wiretaps of the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' statement is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recent FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote during the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, because of the experience I gained in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me away to light Sabbath lights on the table with the cross of the cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, confident that victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season in the 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get to bigger things.
“That was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could do something and got one point with us.
Maybe we could have nodded at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is going to be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home audience in the back, I'm sure we can stand and get a positive result.
Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can get on with it now, put the previous season behind us and get it back.”
Women lose sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear outline of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they’re doing nothing to take that call,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
This is how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t say what you want in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and family where and how care should be given. Such choices can be of great importance in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Get rid of legal problems right away.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to keep track of your medical care, and ensuring that health workers will comply with your wishes should you be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving someone authority over your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications do you need?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that list in place.”
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while on his way home after a night out.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "unmotivated act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have sought witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region below provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency relief administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the north of Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that ravaged dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by colliding buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused several thousand tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, the closure of a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is being detained in Mat-Su custody and is being arrested for an unsecured $500 debt note, KTUU reported.
He was brought to trial on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, absolutely” when asked how he approached the question of guilt, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which could be punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been indicted.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being filed in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, shutting down the report on domestic violence and holding a gun while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and death tolls are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami roared into the beach.
Federal Prosecutors Rarely Seek Death Penalty for Suspected Terror Attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been exercised in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he mobbed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and caused serious bodily harm on purpose, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury threw the 22-point indictment, including eight indictments for money-extortion murder, into the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an indictment for violence and wreckage of vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and intent,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as “horrible, cruel and corrupt.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", states the warning.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could result in the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He did not plead guilty after the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's publicly appointed defenders, said they were "apparently disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the traumas of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution authorities not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians would “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he should be held accountable for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain “would have been erased” now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who took part in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would go ahead with trying to get a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Bone told Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I want to stand up for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan.”
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed allegations that popular opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The assertion that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular with the general public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who are trashing the streets and getting us elected in the first place.
Reject the Brexit plan and start listening".
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians would “feel the pressure” if they thought about betraying the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“This is about the trust between us – the people – and those politicians,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they will not get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small number of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app as the conference began.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider seriously running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts was talking about the future during a town hall meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been at the heart of speculation about whether she will face Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors, who have been using the city hall format since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to come to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman on top.”
Arrest after LSU Sims were killed in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 p.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was observed on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene with a gun and that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without cause and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
The Sims were a two-metre-tall youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for world title after stalllords give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes’ stablelords would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas got a good start and swept Hamilton off the pitch as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some pushing with the wheels that reluctantly allowed the Ferrari driver to free the inside after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and entered number seven at the end of the first round of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race as he lay on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen who lay at number four.
He eventually made it to the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job of getting a good two-team,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a police rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are “evil, ugly, and untrue.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the anger, when you see people who are angry and ugly and ugly and talking untrue,” he said.
“When you look at extraditions and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I haven’t done it.
I haven’t done it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer ... you leaked the document – “oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven’t leaked.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked ... no, we didn’t leak,” he added, imitating the senator’s voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.”
But her denial was not graciously taken up by the president, who during the party event on Saturday night commented: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power by all necessary means.
“You see the madness, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overtake to get power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead early on via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie offset for the home team before Dwyer restored management for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard offset for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefes men, who had come back after beating Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third match of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford suspended the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again offset with a masterly goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game late in the second half, and he secured the victory with the team's faces halfway out in the final round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of air passengers escape from earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia is hailed as the hero after his death and ensured that a plane that had hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely ease.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard it,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country’s disaster preparedness agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"Numbers are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to be reached," the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said in a statement.
Up to six meters high waves have ravaged Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “You see ambulances picking up the dead all the time.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports missing man after plane crashes in lagoon in Micronesia
The airline, which owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says one man is missing. Earlier, they reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon, there was one male passenger they did not track.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as they tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane crashed on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through deep waist water to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers working nearby to repair a brewery also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in the crash of PNG-registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts reveal timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed the proceedings on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to puzzle the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contrary to what he had claimed earlier, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same location as Chambers's cell phone at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went into the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the Sanford trailer that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my trailer was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints suggest that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is community-engaged hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make community-engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a new boom in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York babysitter sues couple over ‘racist’ message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneous message from her mother, who complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies that they are racist and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEII ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, it was an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman who fired Maurice, claiming that their dismissed babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal and demanding compensation on the order of $350 per day for the six-month, housing-based arrangement she was promised, but without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t do that,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back on allegations that they are racist and say the dismissal of Maurice was the only right thing, since they did not feel they could trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she hadn’t meant to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you would have been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
The comparison of the lawsuit with “extortion” said Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months to the term and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Is that the kind of person you want to punish?
It’s not very nice,” added the stockbroker.
As the legal case progresses, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticizes them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington's publisher feared readers wouldn't accept a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children’s book by a little cloth bear, would have been delighted that his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was “bitterly sweet” after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a fairly quiet man, and he wasn’t a boastful person,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child doing a feat: you’re proud of it even if it’s not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a bit that way.
Even though it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give Paddington credit himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn’t think she would survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the call from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it happened.
I couldn’t scream and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get along.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who were unaware of the trials she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I looked down all the time and my tears ran in a steady stream.
It’s hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers folks can call for help.
Sharon’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They said that his smile could illuminate any room.”
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he took his own life.
Sharon says: “I worry all the time that it will be an infectious effect.”
Sharon created the cards “to tell people that there are people out there to go and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit for yourself, you have to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he felt down or depressed or anything,” she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changing mood.
On the first day of Christmas he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they did not get eye contact or anything.
She says his death was a big trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: “It’s tearing up a big hole in the family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
We all have to fight and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread as FBI starts investigation
“I thought that if we could get to any of what he asked for – a time- and scope-limited investigation – we might be able to come to some agreement,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “fall apart” along locked party boundaries.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, Nov. 6 – if Republicans are supposed to do badly, it will be significantly harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators and lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI delivers its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to use his double vote and bring him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "falles" under Kim
The number of North Korean departures to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea’s Ministry of Cohesion, said there had been 1,127 dropouts last year — compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices for human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The majority of North Koreans are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the tightly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China considers migrants to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which technically is still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the locked-in negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally downgrade first," Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in Supreme Court
Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman behaved like this, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes he almost shouted and was weeping as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated murder of character” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony shows that he cannot sit in the Supreme Court because it shows he is biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh for impeachment if he was approved and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court in which he sits now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the interrogation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would override certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
There is a righteous anger, months and years in which the mind prevails, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that strange, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You think maybe I’m sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.”
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was amazing.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I started crying with inexplicable anger and was caught in the neck of an elderly woman —a cool boss I had always been a little scared of— who dragged me into a staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry and be happy because they managed to take you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had been working with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be cheating on his spouse aboard a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought there was nothing in his way to investigate the possibilities of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As it was nearing the end of the campaign, she lagged behind with the funding and swore that she would not quit if she did not get $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asks.
When she made the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to drive money and reach voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism – that she collapsed into tears.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
“You would think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my tombstone?
'She was crying?'"
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
The opening ointments of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The main escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, meaning tariffs on half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, retaliated every time, now most recently with an increase of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match U.S. attacks to attacks, and the world’s second-largest economy probably won’t hoist the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to step down means yielding to demands, but public submission to the United States will be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States could deliver positive results for China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic impacts in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than viewers have realized in the past,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than 7 years of war.
Speaking at the U.N. National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions now facilitate the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising would not be accepted.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 vs 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn got the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for much of the tournament, suffered his tee-strokes in the water at par-3 16th hole, and had to see himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With a total of eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament’s most-winning European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He leaves the relay stick to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a singles game on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely as I grew up,” Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hat off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.”
