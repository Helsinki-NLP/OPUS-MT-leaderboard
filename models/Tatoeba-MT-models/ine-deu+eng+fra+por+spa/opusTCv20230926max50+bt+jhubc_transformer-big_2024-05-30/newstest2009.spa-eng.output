The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday's fall when it fell to about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
The market’s reaction to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives, which refused to support the financial sector secretary’s stabilization plan, is also expressed here.
Fall of shares in Asia
Asian stocks experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the index finally mitigated some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index over its financial day marked nearly four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movements of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
The stock on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The rescue actions planned in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Currency Office.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, i.e., without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens to make the falls felt in other countries.
Bloodbath of American Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system, which is expected to cost $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion kronor).
The legislators, thus, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to nearly seven percent, with a similar drop in volume last recorded in 1987.
The index dropped before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the assembly's proposal was not going forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government Can Inject $700 Billion in Banking
The top representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
Its vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers sparked a gap in talks about approving the bailout plan in its form of aid to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kronor).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and that it is voted on.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
He told Reuters on Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Assembly Bank.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could take place in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Afterwards, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose support to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a great breakthrough.
We have resolved our disagreements about the way the package of measures for market stabilisation should look,” Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the Government Fund.
This should buy unselling mortgage assets from financial corporations that lead to heavy losses for financial firms and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and should also be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Businesses
The global financial crisis has an explicit impact on the rapidly declining stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing their utmost to get Congress to pass a deal definitively on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ businesses before the Asian financial market as these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now, there is nothing clear with certainty about when the two chambers of Congress will vote and, even, whether they will not stall at the last moment with any problem.
Legislators believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion have to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has requested.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program was not fulfilling its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can override its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to gain financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
“We have worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be ready to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s move and appreciated “both sides’ commitment to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy.”
Limitation of the Armored Contract
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chief of the negotiators, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of money from the program for protecting taxpayers’ taxes from their losses, a relief closure of the planned financial plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the program’s participating companies, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made a big breakthrough toward a convention that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also helps homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly burden of debtors’ maturity payments and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Chief Economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but rather difficult.
“And that’s why it’s not known what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not as relevant, according to Marek.
"Most importantly, this week, congressmen will agree on their support and give them their good looks as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to get that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed fighting: The MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are sufficient reasons for man to acquire only the reproducer.
The choice depends practically on the way of its use and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP records no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music get stuck in your shelves, you’re probably dreaming of at least this type of record player.
This is the same with music on the way, that is, compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly taste the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most elementary functions such as calling, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and can even manage to navigate.
And when we take into account the Smartphone and the PDAs will also have in their pocket a small computer.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator knows how to grill and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the display indicator will be lit asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest rushes of energy.
Few are mobile devices that play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play for more than two hours.
If, in addition to this, they constantly call themselves still, for more security, a charger for the work - this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player you will not have this problem, because even the worst can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem happens when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly to the memory card but only in some readers without reduction can the small memory cards that are used in mobile phones be connected.
In players, with some exceptions (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music via the computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipmentinterest in the strength of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the convenience of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as in the tram, then it is enough with any mobile that you play.
This is something that virtually any mobile can achieve.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and virtually all the music you get will be in this format.
It is among the most widely used and with the exception of it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The fewest include the AAC format (the format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and purchase a song or album via the mobile internet.
This service could be by itself a weighty argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the operators’ offer is miserable and most are limited only to the fleeting success topics of the radios.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you will find your mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, hands-free.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone jack.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the disc players is obvious.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that we mistakenly connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic data download account.
What type of device to use
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example, the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for changing the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only one card of 2 GB of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have an 8GB memory.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are considered among the most demanding music lovers take a look at the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of a single player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line phones have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, about four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the aforementioned brand brings MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long before it arrives.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the whole Union.
Following the European Commission’s latest steps in the field of roaming fees regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise – for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS that they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send it from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, also said that there is no longer room in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be quite difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market that brought a significant drop in prices, to which classical operators had to react as well.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for this type of operators and that they can be successful.
There is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we inform you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
After only half a year, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group that, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to work effectively, they need much fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not involve relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs – they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that, however, are often countered by the offer of more tight services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a nothing trivial target group can also be a good blow.
This operator is specifically addressed to man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator you like and can be trusted,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as that of Poland could hook up in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators rely.
In addition, from the point of view of the service offer is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
“We’re talking about expanding this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it doesn’t seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is Mobilking’s launch in other countries in our region,” Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told mobil.cz.
Indirectly, he said that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telephony services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to advance in the meetings," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So, maybe they flash better times.
It seems that, according to unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment we believe the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
Until now no one has addressed us with some complex and serious project in this field," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, spokesman for Telefónica O2, told mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2’s opinion, adds: “To date, we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop.”
“It will be difficult to find any virtual operator on T-Mobile’s network by the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied in such a short period of time."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We see it as the biggest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is to partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a fall in prices and thus a fall in profits.
So why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by the public information available on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: “Furthermore, the competitive environment in the mobile market was not long ago open to a fourth operator.
As far as the character of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean great demands for him and, above all, for his services."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Licensing (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, she expressed her typical stance on this issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement was concluded on the lease of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator.
To date, no agreement has been concluded as the offer of potential stakeholders rather was not interesting enough for classical operators,” added Kristian Chalupa, of the Department of Foreign Relations of the OHSA.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from that they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual operators operate normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in prices of mobile services"
Clearly, pressure on the proper functioning of the market means and the fall in prices do not fall within the interest of the OHIM.
What is really dramatically shocking in this case is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, offers itself.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and of a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding increase in responsibility in their market performance.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added in his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is clearly a relevant market analysis by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> that telecommunications are, from the point of view of commercial tendering, a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech traders has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile operator – with all its logic – has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for OHIM it should be a warning that three mobile operators are strikingly rising in a similar fashion.
The current complaints from stakeholders (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators there are many similar impediments.
Carrying responsibility in the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We have met with him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was recently introduced to expand the competition of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of commercial tenders that was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well known to UOHS representatives, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one's looking
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator is still working unnoticed that a few already exist in Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile services that, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
Usually only a few elected ones get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases like the ones cited were discovered, one could speak of a breach of contract conditions that could result in the end of collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová replied to the question on this issue.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators oppose this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make nothing depreciable profits and, at the same time – unlike authentic virtual traders – they in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns us of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible so much percent of customers.
These, furthermore, must accept that their phone’s SIM card is not in their name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the carriers.”
Precisely this is what should seem to the <0xC4><0x8C>TU minimally strange.
There is also a new question for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators surround the eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if it does not want to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As was already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried to more or less protect themselves from this intrusion.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the more advanced countries, however, regulators have now intervened and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to make the first virtual operator emerge and with him began to emerge others.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body passes this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience, we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But let us not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator really gets to these lands, then the Czech mobile market is probably starting to move again.
If one of the operators lets in a mobile virtual operator, it will be difficult for the OHIM to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one to male voice and one to female voice, one with Chorus and another instrumental.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka are in charge of the canto.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers this Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful anthems.
Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also, with the Choir to fix on the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance," he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home first sounded in the year 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company instead of a paper ticket.
It can now be purchased by nearly one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid as of January 1, 2009) and simultaneously charge it to their chip card at the transport company’s infocenters and stations at the Metro stations, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Lety<0xC5><0xA1>ka, Ko<0xC5><0x88>any.
The bonds can be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who begin to use the internet as a way of trading, can definitely start to forget the ticket offices at the metro stations, where until now they had to queue regularly to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card is charged at one of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is available to passengers a window with prepared staff that helps interested parties with the purchase on the Internet and also with the reloading of the voucher purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard in the vending machines found in some subway halls.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket picker and travelers will probably have already fixed on them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on circumvalation trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that are mainly used by the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the bonus," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the public transport of Prague.
Circumvalution buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver's box.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany him with the Opencard at the place intended for this on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bond.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds, there is nothing easier than requesting the driver this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel on roundabout buses and do not remember when their voucher expires may go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudeten asked in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, presumably, some groups of German Sudetens addressed the US president in 1945.
It is the result of the letters that are stored in a particular archive and that today are stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Sumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and we really want your word that American units are arriving in German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter reads, signed with a “people who carry the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their hearts.”
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the south-east Germans presumably assumes - according to the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors plead in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever <0xC5><0xA0>umava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million people, it delivers us to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all contributes to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of retaliation from the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president presumably doubted this idea of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of the post-war history, may sound a little childish to us, according to some specialists it paints aptly the expectations of the Germans of the southeast at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to intuit minimally that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetes some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they got home, the Czech would be fine," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes they would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - you pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way it could be characterized the emotional Campaign that decided to launch Wednesday the Ministry of Transportation in the media.
The minister’s office, Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek, promises to deter drivers from dangerous behaviors at the wheel.
The 150-million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, the internet and in brochures.
He would have to deter the driver from high-speed and alcohol driving.
And also to remind them that before they get started, the belts are tied.
It wants to raise awareness above all of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and last but not least also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that haunt emotions.
And for this we are attested by the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign:
Don't think - you pay!
The word "Don't think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay."
This must symbolize that man in a moment of despair can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to “fear” viewers until the year 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be observed.
It promises to reduce accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
“For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red traffic light is passed and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says transport psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital, Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
And that is why it is necessary an information campaign in the press and especially a negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
“If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it,” Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
Israel’s interim government president Ehud Olmert ruled on the restitution of virtually all occupied lands in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He suggested in the interview that he appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all (occupied) land if not all," Olmert told the daily.
“I’m sure we’ll be left with a percentage of these lands, but we’ll have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage [of the lands of Israel] because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution, East Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want the tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several dead and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historic place" that is located in the interior of the ancient city.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty across the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won’t work,” he insisted later.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of the Golan Heights withdrawal," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the Shia movement), they will have to give up the permanent support that Hamas (the Shia movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq cause.”
Questions after the accident: Are the maids on the buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can not walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises of whether the maids and passengers can move around the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the azafata's activity is opposed to the road transit law," Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old waitress died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place in the vehicle despite having reserved two more seats.
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the exact moment the steward distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with pedestrian seats.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit down.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency do not have places to go on foot, which was confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
They finally pulled this out and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat,” he said.
The waitress doesn't know the law.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the waitress - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even a legal provision forbids transport agents to perform any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined," added spokesman Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic at the Ministry of Transportation, believes that the law sufficiently addresses this issue.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have pedestrian sites.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided between urban, where there are places to stand and limited speed, interurban with places to stand with higher speed permit and long distances without places to walk, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the airplane, says the expert
BESIP’s transport safety expert, Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, sees no major problems with the movement of the passenger on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much danger threat, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Not even here you have the certainty that turbulence will come and that the waitress will be able to hit her head."
"However, if the bus suddenly brakes, it is evident that the physical laws are valid.
Same as on an urban bus or tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the service of stewardesses.
It employs two hundred people.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that job risky.
"However, the moment I have the impression that the post of stewardess is risky, then I will suppress it.
The coffee and newspapers can receive it, the passengers, on entering.
It would save even expenses,” he says.
In the interest of safety, it is the reason why Asiana lacks stewardesses in her vehicles, according to Alexei Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We have no azafatas, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy
In the accident of the line that connects Naples, a young Pilsen waitress who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid him, however, he collided with the front right.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two places reserved for the maid's rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict on the girl's family's compensation but is waiting for the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring more precision about the move of the stewardess on the bus in which for a year thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transportation have been working.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They do not focus too much on the buses, but rather on the points system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the journey,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of maids to be a significant threat to the safety of passengers," spokesman Hanzelka concluded, saying that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope is based on Frankfurt
In the letter from the board of directors of West LB to its employees there is no shortage of big words.
Due to the merger of the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank, a "central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group" can be formed, as the writing says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how you get to understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also from the Federal Institute for the Surveillance of Financial Services which has recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, there has been a lot of talk about the union of such a kind between DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and West LB.
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, said he does not see any sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But the DEKA board of directors, which is now made up of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board to start negotiations with West LB on joint business activities.
In this it could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen area that the name of DEKA bank appears, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs in the financial site Frankfurt.
At one point in 2003 the situation seemed so that DEKA could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against Helaba’s participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But the idea of merging DEKA bank with other regional banks was always played around.
But lastly, Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, said he was against coexistence plans with his bank.
Independently of that, it seems clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
When the elections to the Bavarian parliament are to be held, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south, the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it has stood out much better from the financial crisis that the real estate of Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided coexistence plans with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank
As you can combine the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca it's the third or fourth time.
But this time, he is assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser-branded beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest attendees that low sounds know how to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, this evening at 23:45 leave three buses, <0x60>direction Munich, the party of beer', predictable arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are the South Americans singing, they had already started to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver legs, owns these buses.
For five years they have come to the Oktoberfest, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the return.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to Bavaria’s law of purity, sickness insurance and a guide in German – Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
It's okay, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian license plate make another pause on Highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group has their scheduled arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others get together, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next in Gothic lettering is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the tent of the campaign are opened, that means "walk!", Marco cries in the morning.
"March!" March and occupy the back seats in the tent of the campaign.
"Don't take the seats in front, because we're going to block, and everyone with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, spread out all over the space!"
A liter of beer, rye Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly ten and a half you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone goes to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps on the trees, traffic signs and even on a poster of the elections of a great Bavarian People’s Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red Cross of Bavaria which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favourite tent of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
Well, let the politician use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that has happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financer, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to resist market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aids amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The share of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to cast interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as from public banks.
The cause of this is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state finances with the money that was lent for long-term projects financed them only for a short period – which is now, because of distrust of the markets, no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank’s capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity has lagged slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued financial investment revenues and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, debtor imputation revenues and some securities also dissolution provisions of credit businesses tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues from reimbursements of the restructuring expenses of the former Depfa group as well as interest reimbursement under the federal tax code and organized business for the consortium companies, the negative balance could accuse a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financer was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
Since the financing of state projects could not make much money, Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of the group's losses and profits, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that they have cancelled the dividends.
By 2007, they had already been cancelled by two-thirds.
Following the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financial institution in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion to finance a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios from its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international monetary markets that are now essentially unfit to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) are starting from the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That’s what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis, there is no consistency.
It is even conceivable that you do not need funding in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
There was a rumor that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation cannot at least reassure worried people.
The stock price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, loan rates according to the position on the property register clearly tend to fall.
The loans of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and loans with maturities exceeding 2009 are particularly affected.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are hardly affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start from the depreciation of pensions within time.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining – the financial crisis is going to be overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing cross-referenced news about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleeping, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the endpoint and use new account transport of losses for future profit-indemnity tax payments on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bent?
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana High School the girls started laughing: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on exchanges she counts Japan.
"First day at a school in Japan.
I was nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in Kawasaki direction and take a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
At eight o'clock in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, it was time for me to introduce myself.
I’m also not a person who likes to speak in public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old mother’s skirt from my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like this I put myself on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because for two years I had already started to study this language.
All 31 girls in the class have chirped, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the Japanese girls' survival vocabulary and means "mona, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then in the playground everyone took out their blessings.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring German slices of bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and something like tofu meat.
In most cases, I have no idea what to do here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of salted plums, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during a recreation.
I read about it in my manga-comics.
I’m curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year of school.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because I'm fascinated."
I have been reading manga for years now.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a lean by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger escapes, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, behaving in the manner similar to us, feel the same?
An internet magazine called "Edge" has been publishing the contributions of famous scientists for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question: What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it becomes dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I won't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated by human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (due to their participation in short memory and conduct-directing executive functions).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of humans than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects pertaining to our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another peculiarity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked to language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that animal consciousness, created as it were, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed by our experiences, then their research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of consensual experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short-memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing happens more to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what does that mean for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for that is activated, the same thing happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when brain activity occupies a space in the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of the linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe the states of others on our own.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the bodily feelings and the brainstem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and men behaving similarly feel the same way?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, then because he is afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, cockroaches, on the contrary, don’t have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations supposedly differ fundamentally from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured in rats and men.
Since I don’t investigate the language and consciousness of rats as well as sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA Platini president: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said preparations would soon take place under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence in Ukraine's ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is a lot to do in both countries.”
The timing of the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lazy.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to do work at great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"Uefa is not going to take our eyes off us."
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured the president of UEFA Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were convicted due to downward manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's counterattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in an interview about private life—and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The backward war of the two roses in the ex-couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of how many times Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man told New York Daily News.
Among other things, it is very "sad" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is married again and recently is a twin father.
And so he ends his statements by emphasizing: "However my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is okay.”
Prices of flights and hotels are falling.
In the first half of 2008, air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and hotel overnight stays were again made cheap – these are the results of a study by the travel and financial services provider of American Express.
The company has analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a major change in the second half.
After for many years prices in the hotel market continued to rise, overnight stays at many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar exchange rate, which was the reason why "the interests of American tourists in traveling decreased."
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, breaking a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airfare prices also showed upward trends:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, Economy class travellers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive by up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, airfare prices in the Economy Class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for the Business Class and First Class were small.
In Germany, the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February, prices rose to 11.9, falling to 23.6 percent in the second half.
According to a study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the price change is, on the one hand, the increase in the sluggish economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is declining.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the U.S. and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit distance flights on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Borussia's Luhukay to him still does not go to make the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of the national team player Marko Martin very well.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed by scoring a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly reacting to what happened, he could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered at the booth entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was a HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades, enjoying a great reputation as one of those who formed part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded his head and lifted his fingers in sign of consent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
“Today wasn’t everything nice to see,” Marcell Jansen later added.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result of 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his headshot; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show their full strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol said.
This Monday, the Hamburg SV will turn 121 years old.
On Saturday, spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It predicts that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the sailing of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quipo with its forced late players like Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the quipo can not shine with his successes.
“We need more feeling and dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the bank’s bailout package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in its history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little bit.
About 20:30 one of the most important stock market barometers in the world traded a deficit of 5 percent at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express who lost nearly 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
The shares of Goldmann Sachs lost nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a major investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The plan of salvation provides for making available resources to buy so-called "poor" mortgage stocks.
But the amount is going to be paid immediately but step by step.
As a compensation for this, the state has to receive share option receipts for financial associations that during the course development may be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state’s fund.
Stock prices in Europe and the U.S. continue to fall
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not reassure investors.
The price of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate falls and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the rescue of the financial market projected by the state, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite bailouts from the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financer’s action for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and posted a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Around the world, financial markets have fallen.
The opening of the Wall Street day in New York City began with noticeable losses.
Investors fear the US government’s $700 billion bailout package is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the Salvation Bill, the Senate vote may be October 1st.

In addition, the trade and tourism consortium announced that the shares in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused researchers to be puzzled: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity may not be as correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens a death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, has caused confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example from Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun's Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravity.
Rather, they frequent irregularities of speed.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
It was called the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general Theory of Relativity which describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be as correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational attendance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained of astronomers in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be dark matter that can also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers in the universe have only known the existence of dark matter for ten years.
It supposedly possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter makes up at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
As Italy’s foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudan’s hijackers had demanded millions of rescues.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE talks about the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently freed.
The same information is presented by Egyptian state television, the broadcaster of Arab television Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"We now control his health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and safe, state-run Egyptian television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting prior to the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was only about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and detained two of them in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the hijackers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the rescue.
The men had to stay detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Abuse of father-in-law "led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight charges of indecent assault.
The Truro Royal Court, through an investigative study, learned that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court found that Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and tie her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was plagued by abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Ms. Rande had said about her, that after having been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "renounced life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Ms. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confessional letter that concludes by saying, "I used to tie her up and bleed her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen responded to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a frightening experience, especially when I was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clear, it is that if she hadn’t done so, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended in court.”
“I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie’s father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is certainly the least serious charge under the law and does not indicate any intention to commit a crime.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
“They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision Monday morning and was immediately transferred from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price tag of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the bailouts of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government, in fact, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The director general of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that becomes in the meantime, is supposed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Construction Societies Trade Association, told the BBC this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price," Cole said.
The interest paid in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of payable interest, which could be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are mutual organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
The residents of the Jersey strait will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will rise by an extra five pence per litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pence in February and in the wake of investigations carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had risen before February was in 2002.
Denied release on bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the bail request for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she may be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His advocates said the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from an entrepreneur when he was prime minister.
This is one of several allegations of corruption at his disposal.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is expected to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s military-backed government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will make an appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina holding that he could not obtain bail because he was already undergoing treatment abroad under parole,” his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We are going to file an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her advocates argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to his homeland after October 17, according to an Awami League leader last Sunday.
She was detained last year after the interim government, backed by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have not been able to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission following the decision forcing the company to reduce its stake in rival ITV broadcasting.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeals for Competition that it will have to reduce its stake in ITV by 17.9% below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission stated that BSkyB’s interests hindered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB’s acquisition of the ITV stake raised doubts about ITV’s independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin’s chief executive, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, it would have handed over its voting rights.
New investigation into the hiring of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former General Producer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved,” Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for underperformance.
But it was later learned that lawyers had not been judged worse than others by their colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the prosecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
They may be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and underlines how he had a “primary responsibility” for the dismissals, who “renounced” his leadership position and was “notably non-cooperative” in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic Meat Loaf of Honour
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special prize next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group are running the nominations for this year’s awards and making the rankings for all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and came to number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell remained in the charts for about nine years and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it emerged that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply serving.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little street, more or less 30 feet wide and 120 long, resembles a dusty alleyway more than one active track.
There's no sign.
It is virtually impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
you want to renovate Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-fashioned neighbors who commented on being enchanted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the city’s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At this month’s meeting of the Vanity Community Committee for Land Use, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the community’s district manager No. 3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, in anticipation of renting the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month’s meeting.
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area,” he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment coming out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The setting was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the East Village burgeoning, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a ray of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk in the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead-end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusted iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with weeks-old newspapers blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and a 22-oz empty beer bottle were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that it might be given a cleanup.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet, and filthy places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of this.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning outcomes, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “bilingual transitional education” for English-students.
However, the question open to Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, will be effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles County region.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanics and low-income families:
More than a third of students, many of whom are newly arrived, are learning English.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
and almost equally astounding 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama favored.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies, and does not tolerate any apology attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal on Sixth Street, the school’s approach to teaching English to students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We’ve had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who have arrived from Mexico and that if you enter the classroom 12 months later you wouldn’t be able to pick up what was.”
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of his party’s politicians on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their very constant support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While it is true that immigrants should learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil Price Drops Abruptly After Renewed Economic Fears
Oil prices fell drastically on Monday due to concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the Wall Street financial crisis and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before falling back, once again, due to huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the latest episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that on the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout agreement "seem to have failed to reactivate the market sentiment."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate is going to be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and forecast oil and gas price cuts are 20 percent for 2009.
Second Quarter of Madness: Team sets record
After spending the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he saw how things unfolded in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a game of deflation.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazy under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect prediction for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the quarter, one of which when one cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps he took to Coles.
"He's a player's devil.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people might think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing in the prey, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to fail by Warner.
In the last turnover, Bowens’s fouls could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a 34-0 final.
These are the biggest points the Jets have never scored in a quarter.
To Team coach Eric Mangini, asked to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter much more than the third.
They’ve earned a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
The resting Gebrselassie leads the world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record in the Berlin Marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the accommodating flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has broken by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, achieved last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the counterclockwise race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate her problems with asthma.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average a staggering 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distance runners, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered cramps in the calf two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension left it fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s Afro-Eastern rival – for the style of over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if it were a racetrack, and setting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race at 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers declined.
But shortly before the three-mile finish, Gebrselassie took one last boost to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place at 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games so she was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her best-record staff in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a smart calculation race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to head and then recovering them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and the tests of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park on the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black-inhabited city incorporated into the country and place of Zora's childhood by Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a touristic stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression Season Writers Project – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the stranger.
“We are very cautious about the way our history is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the claim of blacks and a community of almost 2,400 people living under a level of poverty double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South—sometimes despised, others praised—that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those residing here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
Having the face of cement in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the property store of Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then inside more private areas.
"Out of the road on the left hand," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Ms. Hurston relates Eatonville to autonomous government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
Obviously, this fucker didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on wearing with dignity today.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always so happy to see Zora,” continues Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, nor large public readings.
“I don’t think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to him relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys went around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to them,” Mr. Franklin said.
“They killed a girl, too, once.
They threw him against a watermelon from the car."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston, she wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted rather than honored my race."
R Residents say today that the segregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
“Black children were used to being hugged – I remember this – they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and CEO of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't going to hug your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons—black writers, actors, and artists who passed over prejudice, just as she did, with buzzing, confidence, and lines like, “How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookshops, reintroducing it into American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Ms. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put on what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the city itself.
Out-of-town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006, on a paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come looking for the history of Eatonville, of its significance, are often still treated with caution.
A prior permission is required to do most of the interviews, and some things – such as the murals in Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field – cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has weakness for the bright red, still fears that her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way Mrs. Hurston saw her whole race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and equally the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare to go up here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finances all the time.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the beehive offices that lie above their heads, the bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face the worst “office bad day” since the 1929 ditch.
Boys for home delivery continue to make their metal tea carts resonate through the sidewalks and bring muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to crawl between busy apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric stamping shirts hanging to a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their meals to take in the morning, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4am and 7pm on working days.
Employees are still waiting to queue for their bagel at the vendor’s carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me that there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there are, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy’s large warehouses and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “trusted personal banker,” and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had switched, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction society), from the credit unions and the savings boxes of their hometown whose branches only function within the state of belonging, and who say they treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a bailout buyer.
Workers in offices and shops standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is what most Wall Street bailouts are doing.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its afflicted-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they were complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fiftieth and somewhat uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switching is done, I’m not taking any risk.”
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a Belgian member of the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs depicting mosques with a red line crossing.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend as far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David over some of the tombs, but researchers think this may have occurred by trying to conceal the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were “deeply shocked” by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious as the month of Ramadan was coming to an end.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the right-wing turn in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Austrian Alliance for the Future, had conducted a campaign centered on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties attempt to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing policy of Islamization in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a travel ban last Thursday after judges had produced evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford Magistrate’s Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad as well as to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that she wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the sex offender registry.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary that you inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risk that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged 10 to 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court of Justice, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source at the Interior Ministry reported that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and glad to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"Capturing the master out of the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, deprived of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the other hand, the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments alien to the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hand, carefree because they will not come out on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the programme of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, increasing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "may be anyone but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you do not need to take photos from the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco.
With the flavor of the "Sing of the Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a record camera.
These are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall the classic photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dance, singing or touching itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the elf that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous figures of flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, form this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the sample.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTproject".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter a moment in their life, be it a long or short moment.
I think that within photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, who sometimes you don’t even know, or who leave you only a few minutes to be able to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco titled "Flamenco-people" is on display in the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of the Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where you can visit until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a temerity"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to bringing forward the new project in which he works, a novel that stars Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always-favorite Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday on his way to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
“If I were sensible, I wouldn’t, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the highlights of the third edition of the party of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the writer most voted by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend," filled the aphorism of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a history of "re-education" and "re-education" that was given to him very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "reading pleasure" and "living more than he lived;
The Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience", stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "makes people more inconsistent", so he asked them to leave their writing.
The weather worsens the Pozoblanco fair, which also runs out of areas
The rejoining party that closed the subscription to the Pozoblanco fair was suspended on the morning of yesterday, after checking the announced rejoiners that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather conditions have been primed with this fair, as finally two of its three celebrations have not been able to be celebrated.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a prison of Castilblanco
So, there was only a party on Friday.
In it, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out to the shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante sold out his two stalls with greetings and an ear, which granted more stretches than his bull.
Yes, even worse was El Julio, who passed through the cos of Los Llanos without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a faena of relief he won the bronch of a large part of the audience.
A control in <0xC3><0x81>lava is skipped in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The officers give up the two occupants of a van and they undertake the escape.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The agents chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., the Basque Government's Interior Department said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control on the N-1, on their way through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated abruptly and skipped control.
The agents began their chase until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arsenal, at which point its two occupants rushed to the race through a wooded area.
The Ertzains finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish loads, so they proceeded to transfer it to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials verified that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not match the collection in the van's documentation, so the arrested person has also been charged with a crime of falsification of public document.
Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as stated, and determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., was transferred to police units to carry out the corresponding diligence and will be made available to the courts in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Drug Effects
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers as she tried to leave her car park in Montecito, a California highway patrol spokesman told People magazine.
The witness has detailed that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and going backwards he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who apparently had not recognized the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned the emergency services because she was "worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to the officers at first glance, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison at about 7 p.m. but was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where she was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making treaties in favor of family members.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," said Llamazares about the performance that the party must adopt with the one that has so far been the councilor in the Sevillan consistory.
However, the leader of UI argued that the need for “transparency” is present in possible investigations into irregularities that Silva may have committed: “IU has always advocated for such matters to have the highest degree of transparency.”
In the same line, he stressed that the training has "strict codes of ethics for all public offices".
'Blood of May', Garci's Epic Bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in its filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
A great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures that he has fulfilled with this filming "a childhood dream", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a film commemorative to the second centenary of the 2 May madrileño, something that he accepted as long as he was national.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set up with the decors and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a flattered Spain that was mistaken as a boss for which to fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII".
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not have funding like Alatriste’s or The Ghosts of Goya – more than double that of Blood of May – so he has not been able to shoot some scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Restart, has focused on what is his usual way of working, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the filming and who does not cast, because he finds it "humiliating" and considers that "part of the industry of the director lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in it".
Many of the performers with whom he coincides in Blood of May repeat before his chamber, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Nominated for the Oscars on four occasions - of which she won one -, Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the Blood of May itself, Seven tables of French billiards and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which must be known.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
“In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you’re content with making one more movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A dancer from Seville will pay tribute to a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was incredible.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested me sticks of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
Their dance was sensual and I’ve been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic,” she says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, just as he did in "La puerta abierta"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola the Elder, the character of maturity.
I’m happy that he has agreed to act in my work and I feel very honored for that.”
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal accompaniment of her, all of whom are artists in this kind.
The work also tells somehow the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less values her work,” Bayon said.
The show will start today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta ReciénCasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia" and the "Zenobia" (organized by Juan Ramón y el Trieno de 2006).
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón Internacional" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the province of York, will travel through different countries.
Also, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the diffusion of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America Is Less Liked Without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on “Absence of Malice,” and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, to the shocking idea that Newman has left.
Look how hard it was to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And I knew he was very sick.
Still, it has been a mess for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better because of their existence.”
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or to exaggerate.
A father of cinema and the homeland had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem for the soil, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire are left to you, you do not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his first-born overdose dead to his home-made and organic food brand.
A gift to a country that has had a lot of trouble overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood away without meeting nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing more than the height of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“It has left us all very high,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand for probity and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal when there were certainly opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger outside the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud of as that of a devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race was called, and in my opinion it was the worst race I’ve ever been in.
A heap of misadventures that, of course, if they considered it as an evaluation and I examined it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let’s go by parts and from the beginning.
Mistakes start with picking up the backbone, which makes you have to go earlier.
Which I don’t think is bad, but if they already make you go give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the back (first useless, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second useless, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Or is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a minutia compared to the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race started and we had not yet left the backpack, although once it was achieved, the pickup was worse.
In addition, the rain eased the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by popular rebellion and assault on the cottage.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark me the exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it wouldn’t come into my mind.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Search Receptionist (Virtual)
At the Emerging Technologies conference at MIT, Microsoft has shown an advancement of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) listening to it.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they wear - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him that he will be attending to him soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there has been a lot of talk about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of commercial garbage loads, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All a finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand each other.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true. It's true.
It will never disappear, but we must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as relative.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
The computer boots only to run Firefox or the Explorer – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less charged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I give you a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft’s employee rest rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
In the refreshment machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather throwing in 2010.
Microsoft will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start to list stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that pointed moustache hoist that was lifting weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men’s interior shirt in cotton, belted and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the English speakers call, but Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles rises above all others.
First, because of its bumpy name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because it gets its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most iconic T-shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Apparel designed for comfort underwear.
It is a pity to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't care"
His huge resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the company Mango does at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but, at the same time, exciting day.
On what is your new collection for Mango based in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get a lot of references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women go dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have many ties in common.
I liked clothes from a young age; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to check out my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that dancers like to make our own styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get the costume is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You're not in your 30s, have you been in a crisis?
What's up?
I feel better than ever, I like the 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
For me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I’ve done the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I am going to be a mother because my body asks me to be a mother and I also want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is to give my son a lot of happiness and to educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you’re eager to hear about several premieres you shot last year.
That’s right, and I’m looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, everything I want for already and of course, it cannot be.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
See what they look like...
A few days ago, you made your debut on a walkway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went up a walkway to be a model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for a long time, called me to invite me to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization Women for a Better World and the clothes we exhibited – I took two pieces from our collection for Mango – were auctioned off to raise money for this NGO from Naomi.
People don't know that sweet heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that I, who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm stuck with that good part she's involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to make the pine, so too.
For benefiting third world women, whatever it takes.
Recurrent drivers due to alcoholemia will have to install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the drunk vehicle from starting, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General of the State, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so he will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office of Road Safety, the General Traffic Directorate (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving return to the car.
The alcoholic would avoid it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow axes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would run at the expense of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is bound by administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing those behaviors before they result in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by the ordinary way, and yet the necessary reform by the criminal way requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally deployed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., the time scheduled in the program, the Spanish Air Force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling was landing in the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the real couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier, he had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, well, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or something...
- No, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence formed by 27 Navy soldiers playing the savior of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, windy, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps she had been told that in the DF threatened storm.
They give the photographers a smile and a sneak peek before moving into the room where the official crowd awaits.
At the door of the hotel they are staying at, one of the city’s four big ones, they are awaited by a dirty reporter from Mexican television.
The Best-Equipped Fashion Award
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and there is possibly no living designer more exquisite and bont liven than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is awarded with a prize of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango showcase at number 54 of Paris’ Haussmann Boulevard and almost cried of excitement.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and it has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the competition, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, heartbroken and heartbroken by the recent death of her brother, put on a suit from the House and cut-outs from Allah, and from the arm of her son Luis – a nearly two-metre-long cannon – accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his homage dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had borrowed them from two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she transformed herself in a sexy long black dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed a fold and made a barge.
Inés Sastre did not stay at the walk through the dependencies of the palace, but earlier he showed us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that moves on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having ordered beforehand, that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenzied everyday life.
And just for the record, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine yourself wrapped up in the hectic pace that current life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection from the working world.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Aside from yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities tailored to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores at the hands of Pearson Alhambra and DK publishers.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking Sleepy
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean these people who wake up very upset telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they’re asleep.
The first time it happens at best you take a scare, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquies.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (peeing asleep) or somnambulism, but it doesn’t have to be so.
As we have already mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever rates, stressful situations or overexcitation.
However, it is an unstudied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a whisper or the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him a way out in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a bit violent.
With children very nervous and difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will help the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
Once the sleep talks appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even if he’s talking, he’s sleeping and therefore he’s resting.
Remember that if you are very anxious during several episodes you should consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the most common), don’t be tempted to interrogate him to get him information.
You won’t get anything, because when you’re asleep you’re not conscious enough to organize your thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with which you are very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even a joke.
This leads to children's anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on their field after a long period of shortage.
Without having made a good game, the team created many goals and was able to score a goal to win the game.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to sweep the squad with a shot away, Illhaeusern almost took the "power" and by Fonderflick's turn from far, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of his foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we did not let the midfielder pass and we left only Riahi in attack position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two goals from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scorer for the Illhousiens with the goal from Marais, well placed to pick up the rejected ball in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the goalkeeper Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the wardrobe a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take the opportunity and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who backed down a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major farfulla, the ball passed very close to the cross-field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a tour of Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who severely disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and expect him to " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " set up by Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the rise in oil prices, which marks a record at 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president will “discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors.”
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on his feet.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have resulted in nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
Quiberon's marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le have not been stopped.
A " filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, scratching the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bulls stayed in the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday’s meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " they do not want to move to Paris " , announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chair of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that one can reach the financial equilibrium point of a ship only with one diesel with a price of less than 0.30 euro per litre.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of "Two Men and a Destiny" has died from cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who has passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aviation company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession weighing on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its forecasts for deliveries for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market in particular to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 appliances to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been taken out of trouble thanks to U.S. monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 percent of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its aerial leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 percent stake in the insurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the Financial Times adds.
No definitive decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times continues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve at the risk of the U.S. authorities taking 80 percent of its capital, diluting it with the proper proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, a loss never seen on the stock market of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq a 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most significant drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day on which exchanges resumed after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index, a dominant technology, fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index by 8.81% (i.e., 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the definitive figures of the closing.
Already depressed by the crisis early in the session, Wall Street sank after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the plan to save banks that would have allowed some market stability to recover.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"This shows to what extent the market had this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come "too late."
“If the project is really dying... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the lead (the U.S. central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further,” said Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, “every day the collapse of a financial institution is announced” in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions to the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis,” the analyst at FTN Financial added.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond declined by 3.632 percent from 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4.161 percent from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama Wins First TV Duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House, another happened to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen considers John McCain's performance, though honorable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to curb his run-off in the five-week presidential election polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday grants five points of advantage to Obama (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges it is the Democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious with 39 percent of the respondents, while 25 percent of them concede the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of his own candidacy, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventeen-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, underlining his opponent’s “naiveness” on these issues that were at the heart of this first face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... " he accused on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said he represented the future.
Without baffling, he was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already,” he said this weekend, in a Democratic television advertisement blaming the Republican for failing to consider the impact of the crisis on Americans.
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a cold rain.
He did not utter the words "middle class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable character to save the economy that is on the brink of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," said influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster “is the final eight-year consequence of a bad economic policy put in place by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would nevertheless succeed in reducing taxes of 95% of Americans despite Wall Street outbursts, the Illinois senator also pointed out that achieving the country’s eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates shunned issues related to the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of polling stations in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, he has to resign".
Some admit they haven’t voted: “Why, because they’ll do what they want with my vote,” says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has put foreign observers on a good footing in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We have been put next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes," said Iouri Potemkine, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former presidential election opposition candidate and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it's the executive power.
If some members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
"But their entry into parliament may mean television appearances, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we don’t reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
It underlines that participation figures appear to be too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? Question Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five MPs from the opposition in parliament, the ones that are best suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate him on his success.
Interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence that had been seriously vacillated by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
National blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, to clarify the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and make recommendations for such a disaster not to be repeated.
While Judge Krever was delayed in presenting his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, nearly 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Decary recalls.
The situation was disheartening.
After having made a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence,” he says before proudly asserting that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Decary says.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can arise from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had remained in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been undoubtedly shown that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until now were based.
The nucleic acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
This substantially reduces the risk that certain donors will be infected without our knowledge and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“That means you’ll have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that it is possible today to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without worries,” says the head of Héma-Québec’s management.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You have to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary says before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
" Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Because anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average regroups only 3 per cent of eligible Quebecers for blood donation. "
All people in good health, aged 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria can, however, donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since today’s life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating your blood,” says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a blood-rich stem cell that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bench our thousandth blood sample from the umbilical cord and it is expected to take out more than a thousand of these per year.
We should start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
“Many moms are disappointed that they can’t enjoy this,” as Héma-Québec doesn’t have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL's first division elimination series, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in summary finishes) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half without a goal from anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals opportunities.
Roger Levesque was the only one who knocked out Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first match of the round-trip series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the back game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless conceded in the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact is set to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The number one Canadian trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian to the free-kicks barrier against the Florida Panthers, last night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warned the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play to the fullest in the first half, noted Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation.”
Charest occupies the North
The prime minister does not rule out holding elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party’s general council is over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected during today’s by-election.
To reject the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength by staying on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, of mining, of Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very busy.
The “North Plan” is the fourth side of a “vision” that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space”, which includes a labor agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could especially be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's listing.
This “territory twice as large as France” is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it’s in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was requesting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush at Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
“It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion presents itself, I reiterate that position on the part of the government," he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open every year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Ungava Quebec party), have already begun consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which "a common vision will be given".
Northern development would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan “will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival in power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
"From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, to Lesage that made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa that made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative one, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the issue of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
"This stays between us, but expects to be there," he confided to his militants, arousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend ' s general council provided the Liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problem being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular called for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcome the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what you want is that this isn't just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, the former minister of “Justice” (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed to say last summer that Luisa Arbour was a “shame” for Canada.
To disgrace this woman who fought an unceasing struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says about the relations between the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are being recriminated to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who counts on a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it cares little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, certainly forever after so many years of exaggerations.
We don’t realize that yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” that’s the word that Harper keeps repeating and that makes no sense.
The time has come when morality no longer exists: we can arbitrarily mistreat, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far wants minorities (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what it did to the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world attempted a defamation trial of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to hold a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the nearly bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these uneven struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will dampen the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by garrotting.
It was therefore sufficient for the miner to open her books, her records and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the funding of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate disregarding the views of the latter?
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand — or what he doesn’t want to understand — is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does it mainly because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not on what many people perceive as a persecution-bite (persecuting the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just filed a demand with respect to the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and make a debate about facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he does not want to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months still has to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It provides in particular for better control by those elected to implement it, for new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, for new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for non-payment, as well as a right to monitor the wages paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis,” she said.
“It’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos, and disturbances over the daily lives of Americans will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that a further failure in the investor’s mood would have.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential election, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather in favour of the agreement, not forgetting however to express their discontent of being forced to reach this limb.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow owners to retain their home and the one about the salary of the executives of the companies surviving by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, one should not be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, questioned on another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
“The important points I read [show] that it’s something that we’ll have to digest and with which we can move forward.
He said the option of not doing anything is unacceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy dubious debts, risky assets and unselling assets from U.S. financial institutions with taxpayers’ money.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis provoked by the burst of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and causing liquidity freezes and outflows from banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft of the deal, last week.
We believe we have come out of the stalemate since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to alleviate the hardships for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to bear losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
In return for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will earn him dividends in the event of profits and that he will be able to re-sell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay embargo procedures concerning homes obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as set limits on remuneration and on cash compensation paid to executives of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
“We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that consists in taking advantage of taxpayers.”
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems in a different way, but comes to the same conclusion.
Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to take.
At this very moment, in Europe, we had once again the proof of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion ($2.9 billion) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a voting right in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Committed Icon
His blue eyes were his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a charming smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity, and a talent that was evident will also have removed him from the record of power that true sacred monsters have.
What a great backdrop!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at age 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the fastest years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he resembled a lot and who was considered for a long time as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and of the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes children magnificent.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without overwhelming ego, the latest quality brand.
Because in it was projected an entire country in love with the self-made man, the wounded combatant of the Pacific war, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the auto driver who ranked second in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused dizziness to moviegoers this weekend, as their big roles clashed on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual movement parades through it.
Many memories come to mind as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others such as Paul Newman have gone down in the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This nice manga in the sumptuous film The Sting (The Strike), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's magnificent 1961 film The Hustler, he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill’s Slap Shot (1977), by Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the Irish mafia's godfather in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends who left the race quite early, Newman stayed a long time in the world of film, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its fasts and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in "underplaying" and that judges its overly supported performances.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of a young gallant than of a marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed his not-so-familiar true psychic sensitivity.
Her film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of humour and sadness.
"Among the numerous tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former weapon partner Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very sadly: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against Hollywood excesses.
We will have seen his face reign over the cans of vinegar sauce, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The proceeds from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than contenting himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag & amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant harm, in business mode, continuously and in an organized way in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, they used the funds obtained in the public tenders for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfillment of tasks with false invoices.
The public and municipal funds - in their entirety about HUF 65 million - were partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pocket of private persons.
The method, which was disclosed by the researchers also, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the various associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were false.
For this purpose they obtained the talonaries in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular stamps were made in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question of which company to make the counterfeit invoice was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model for making the invoices that they submitted, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, as well as in the City of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation - later called Együtt to Armadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, yet on the bill there were one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of high-fashion invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft. gastronomic center because in the holding of books of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppa.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor’s office and shown the invoices, he already knew they were fake documents.
"In the stamp, our company name and NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the invoice one hundred people were accommodated, since they only have eleven rooms in which not so many people can be accommodated.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the chosen travel agency in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency’s practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as was learned during the investigation, they also included VAT in the document, even though travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-exempt.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, since the services of such a company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 per cent VAT, and the hotel employees only extended machine-made invoices although the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "senders" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - improper format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices sent for Együtt to Armadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont were false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also paid no attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They deliberately issued the bills.
Another group of fake invoice makers are those who were aware that they had to issue fake invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and its associates Biogate Kft., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyes activity association.
There was no movement of capital either, since afterwards they canceled the prepared invoices but forgot to make it appear in their documents to this entity.
The following group of fake invoice makers include those who have some connection to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the fictional Budapest-based Delta Trio SL, which dealt with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 is in the process of liquidation.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have dispatched also the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppa and for Együtt to Armadik Evezredért Alapítvány charging the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because – according to the defendant – they didn’t get a job.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, they sent invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations associated with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generación.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received the VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri company to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generation and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért submitted a contest in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), public utility of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they received 500,000 HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
To keep this from being discovered, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants are likely to report in the trial - as they did at the Prosecutor's Office - the course of the counterfeiting of the invoices.
The most interesting will be the confession of the main accused himself János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
His confessions have so far not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so until now.
The question is: what interest does he have in doing so, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists came to an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all responsibility.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of highly valued economic crimes, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the verdict, he has no chance for that.
Overlapping Psychology: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
New York University neurologists and economists have discovered the neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists attempted to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other participated in an auction, and in the meantime, the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called the stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, along with many other functions, plays a role in the nervous system’s “self-prize” mechanism.
Thus, according to the scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention to not provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To support their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more prize money.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction, the group members would lose even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winning" group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
Until now, auctions have been explained only by the joy of winning and the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should I go to the doctor?
About 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 receive treatment because many of the patients do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; they are characteristic of liver infection and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses dependent on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and with body moods (sperm, vagina mood, saliva).
It is advisable for travelers to protect themselves with a vaccine against viruses A and B, there are no vaccines against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that appear on the skin and on the white of the eyes jaundice, the stool becomes clear, dark-colored urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year, one million people die in the world from cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to calculations, only one in ten infected people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment, it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathogen gradually destroys the cells of the liver and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical check-up, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory checkup as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its goal is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and to the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, the religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain, the British newspaper The Telegraph reported.
As part of this unique experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of a series of researches in which, alongside academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the University also participate.
The analysis took place as follows; they attached a sparkling instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; the 17th-century Virgin Mary, by Sassoferrato, and the 15th-century Lady of the Arminio by Leonardo da Vinci.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during that period while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics said that looking at the Virgin Mary they felt in “security” as “protected” people, “they were reassured and in their heart reigned peace”.
When they looked at the religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such impactful image you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
“We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
“Exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results, there remains only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary give even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: you can find it in people’s pockets, as well as in the sky above your head; you know where they spent their holidays, what doctors they visit and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian view do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s primary goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather all the information in the world in one system!”
According to Google’s leader, the company, even after ten years of work that revolutionized the world, is still in the early stages of being able to process all the information.
To the question of what is going to happen in five years Schmidt replied: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like “What to do tomorrow?” or “What would be the job that best suits me?” – however, software will not be able to answer seemingly simple questions as long as there is not enough user information.
Not all Internet users are aware that while browsing the Web they accurately store the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages where they went at the end of the search.
Thanks, for example, to Personalized Search, which debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can check again what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic will be based the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined preferences and store.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned by seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already a confirmed fact that not only retain, but in justifiable cases also cede to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information from its website, called Orkut, to identify paedophiles.
On the other hand, internet users who care about human rights were relieved in May when the company along with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated before the court that it was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google could not be compelled, by any of the points of the F-type constitution, to request information from the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get under the pretext of reinforcing the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand web addresses and about a thousand searched phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is the rather contradictory opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life is being harmed by starting to use Google’s services, and rebel against it as against multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as the conqueror of the World, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet that was produced just by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even merge them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then these can be included in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the most recent photos are automatically stored in F photos.
We can know numerous cases from which it follows that, for example, the bride, seeing the flow of photographs of the following morning from common friends, finds out who spent the night before his fraudulent boyfriend or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the management of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of private life is valid.
A person's "online" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of today's youth.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least wants to evade Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting with, for example, the Scroogle that uses Google’s search engine, but leaves no marks).
There are many people who don’t want to sign up on collective pages to prevent them from being found, but they can replace Google’s “online” apps, from text-editing software to image and news-reading apps with alternative versions that don’t connect to gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion almost openly expects the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while other software companies that are introduced more and more rapidly also cause no serious pain.
Critical observers, however, will find the regime's contradictions alarming too: for example, the top management rejected the protest of the employees after doubling the price of the company's daycare, they considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees' feeding, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 the good company gave up the chi to the government's moral pressure.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that we will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it was already ready to work, which if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to wreak havoc on the World: while some believe that the project of scanning and archive of books and magazines of Google will soon acquire such dimensions by the company.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database will be able to provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, a popular novel by Cory Doctorow, orwelianly describes that future, in which a man only from Google’s data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped clear the footprints of the perpetrator of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x96>zd who, according to substantiated suspicions, helped erase the crime's footprints, a spokesman for the Borsod province's police department said on Tuesday.
The girls acknowledged the crime they were charged with, and are currently being accused of perpetrators of the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency, these are two girls - will be able to defend themselves freely.
For complicity you can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigation it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor to the headquarters of an <0xC3><0x96>zd company, where he killed him and then also killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared himself much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a previously hidden weapon at the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the shares within a few months.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with it, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kronor.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the increasingly deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second 9/11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. president - The Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the hastily made bill, whose goal is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it’s more correct to talk about a “second 9/11.”
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo’s view, the mistake of U.S. political leadership was the one that led the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is growing and this will then have an impact on the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote, the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – precisely when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored, says the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life-belts at shaky financial institutions, saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
But if, like the dominoes, the bank collapses further, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, member states of the European Union need to put aside their nationalistic selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion on Monday alone, Der Standard recalls, adding that concerns are becoming more real that, as Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not dealt seriously with the crisis that passes like a nickname for the Old Continent.
The "rescuers" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater harm?
The smart car mimics the flight of the owl
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not imitation of the existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, that of the beetles.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, beetles gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C car robotic steering system, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each owl creates its own oval private space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technology director of RP and development and research.
Composite eyes of owls that are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of compound eyes, the engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle’s microprocessor which immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot mimicking the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle's robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process should reflect what a hog does to avoid other hogs.
This process should be done in an open and closed eye.
However, unlike the buckets, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the bumblebees to avoid other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotary movement and the acceleration further the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process the data, let alone the storage.
This apparatus in every second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which, according to Nissan’s calculations, can be incorporated into mass-produced models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to their destination, avoiding existing obstacles in their path.
He already has a name for this dear child.
A written version of the $700 billion bailout bill has been prepared, which will be implemented in several phases in order to buy bad credit from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to East Coast timetable during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial bailout package in total, after several days of discussion.
We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, saying that the agreement was only formalized in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the result of the compromise, Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: “This program will work and will be efficient but further measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the cart of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. on Monday, Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular leap in the exchanges.
On the bill called the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, the U.S. Congress and then the Senate will vote on Monday.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also welcomed the news about the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bonds of poor quality credit stocks.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy bonds of credit, under-rated securities and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the decision of the president.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credit, mortgages and securities credit stocks, as well as other "poisonous" type credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auction or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated: the law so secures the necessary financial means, that it can even reach up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, its insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it.
Instead, the heads of the banks that are in trouble and waiting for state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensations, which the American slang simply calls golden parachutes.
Payments will only be limited in certain cases, and the limitations depend on the form of assistance provided by the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed boss retires.
By buying bad credit directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that bosses’ compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts are not going to be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the program as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limitation on the incomes of CEOs - said the measure by Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they will be able to make profits from the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank recover.
According to the bill, in the next five years the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to reimburse taxpayers for losses in the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed reservations about the project.
“This is not what American citizens entrusted us with, that is, they are not protecting taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic counterpart, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were urged by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors rose minimally, by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to the 4.6 percent monthly increase in bags and belts and the 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of the plastics and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemicals production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a decrease in price in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 percent), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).
They did not change the prices of papermaking, publishing and printing.
In the rest of the processing industry sectors, prices rose between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent an important weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 percent was recorded in August, primarily due to the effect of the increase in official prices from July 1.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the highest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4%).
In the metalworking sector there was an increase of 13.2 percent, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of determining weight, there was an increase of 11 percent.
Prices declined in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent).

Will you no longer need a visa to travel to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, to the Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion, "practically everything depends on the electronic access and control system being built on time on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the entry premises will disappear, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin must register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy holds talks in Washington.
He will interview Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing him the Median Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday assured their support for the administration's $700 million banking aid program, while there are politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-like negotiations, on Sunday morning announced: a principled agreement was reached on the financial bailout package for the banks.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, by putting economic issues at the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared the McCain advantage he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice president.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
“We have to act now and responsibly... jobs, your savings, whole industries and the stability of the entire economy are in danger,” he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that “we’ll all swallow this hard... but doing nothing is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said the proposal included the establishment of a control commission to the fineness minister and the limitation of compensations for executives, he insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any major role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister on a daily basis.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen are likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
German-speaking press magazine
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious voters - says the Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (mirror.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had assumed office.
Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria – and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU achieved 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 elections to the Bundestag, i.e. still during the mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been prognosticing this for 40 years, but at the pace they made a lot of mistakes. However, the secularization, the results of education and settlement of the northern Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had its negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases opportunities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself have become the most conscious, the most critical and the most stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks it was the conventional groups of citizens that moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have a bachelor’s degree and the graduates.
Thus, support for the CSU was reduced to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open in all directions to negotiate, while the Greens still do not want to consult on the coalition.
Elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely let some of their decks be seen.
Werner Faymann, SP<0xC3><0x96> president, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left out the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, in the post of vice chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or join the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed, within the <0xC3><0x96>VP itself.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has started in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the turnout president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People’s Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to their interests.
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, gypsies are left out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of education.
"Most young Gypsies have not finished high school and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can get a university diploma."
Mr. Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise a wide awareness of these issues both among Roma and non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a gypsy student starts school, the more chances he will have to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be assured of the right to a quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to accelerate immediately the processes of school segregation, for this it is of fundamental importance that the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full-fledged citizens.”
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, held annually since last year's Berlin meeting, which was held under the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision will be made on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the Bavarian CSU summits, so far the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president, and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, remain in office, but it is not known how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized duo let it go: they do not cling so much to their positions.
In doing so, they intended to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – though under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career – the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, while now, a year after the coup attested against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a "monopoly" in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to form a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber’s possible successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that initiates negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the fate is that in the list of Free Electors that Gabriele Pauli enters parliament, whose performance against Stoiber was used for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly wiped out the ambitious local politics.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, he will also receive an active role of Stoiber who so far has been moving the strings in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU described September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 elections to the Bundestag, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to highlight together the CSU that played a significant role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, she could barely hide her disappointment with the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
Which of course is relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After the elections on Sunday, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability it guarantees in the country Alexander Lukashenko, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is rather explained by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, made up of one percent and ten deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the elections of 2006 would change this "dubious legitimacy, or change the constitution for the time of legitimacy.
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which increasingly depends economically on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and that contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give them political permission to enter the EU.
It was a sign of relaxation when the OSCE, in evaluating the election campaign, put emphasis rather on positive phenomena than on mistakes - such as the ban on participating taxed one-third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary report on Monday even criticized the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already a month ago that considers the two regions as independent.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears allowing even an opponent to enter that parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when it sees the results, rather it tries to get voters their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us a lot of problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, local authorities put difficulties with its distribution, but even so I see that there are more and more who support the change among the elderly too - said Milinkevich, alluding to that to the regime of Lukashenko, who believes that its main result is the creation of the official social security, if they do not consider it.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that "seems like the silence of the cemeteries" - said Milinkevich.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that automatic doors were placed to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against whom it registers and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
“A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta stresses again.
With Chigi Palace the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, the secretary-general assures: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on the part of the workers".
In short, no more breakfast at work hours; no more coffee and half moons.
Brunetta’s words suggest, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences due to illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people at work in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the public administration more effective
"Which wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rate."
By now millions of public employees have joined to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lower absenteeism from work due to disease – writes the consumer association – the people of ‘vague workers’ is constantly increasing.
In Italy, millions of the right and productive public administration employees have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree.
In particular, the TAR will address the exclusion of aggregated economic treatments due to sickness due to service; the extension of the time zones in which the sick employee's medical check-up visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Occupational accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirms that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic issue, today the Emil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalid by Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
“It has manifested itself, a ‘suffering’, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, whereas the everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment are of particular significance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to slow down the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, the Speaker of the House Gianfranco Fini has underlined "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to put an urgent end".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being equally impressive," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
We do not want this “tendency to decline” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy exploits.
"We believe that at a general level too little is still being done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
More controls and inspections are necessary, at our discretion - has emphasized Mercandelli - but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world. "
"Further effort is needed - he added - as far as communication and public opinion awareness is concerned.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection envisaged for victims of work" and the "assistive drift towards which the system has been heading in recent years".
"The goal is to return the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the luck of the one who accidents does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time."
MP3 Players Under Charge, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent damage to hearing.
The European Commission cites the opinion of the EU's newly identified Scientific Commission on Emerging Health Risk (Csserri) in a statement released in Brussels today.
"From this scientific opinion - read the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at a high acoustic level can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"A clear risk emerges from the scientific evidence - EU responsibility follows - and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public domain.
We must also examine the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have the pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that that causes.
“Scientists confirm that this is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with member states and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable music devices and related devices.”
At present, there is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and time of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that if users of portable music devices listen to loud (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week they exceed the currently in force limit for the maximum noise allowed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing after a period of 5 years.
It means it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bull" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to emphasize Alemanno – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the council and the city council, can then endorse.
There is no leftover position of roles, only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March finished the works will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – announces the intendant – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.
To whom the Commission is accused of being useless, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, your contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always, politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that manifest themselves back and forth.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, into a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
The Rome intendant also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a triviality: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital expresses".
For Alemanno, in effect, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which we absolutely need, thinking with a united spirit to its future".
A future that, the intendant of Rome explains, “will not be limited to the present municipal boundaries but will look beyond” not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but “also considering the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean”.
The first anti-American president.
He has written a well-known American politician who is interested in pretending to be independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does also today gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.
“Obama has a big face of stone: he believes he won the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, they are attacks that don’t say much; they are clearly attacks of a racial nature and don’t answer the question of voters: Will he be a good president? And besides, there are the polls; everyone says that Obama wins and with a good lead.
Also in this case there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the bowels of the southern United States has written an editorial: Once in the cockpit to vote, we will know who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mentality is covered to the last.
“Say whatever you want, we’ll think about where to put the cross later, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Never before said things, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1,500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change the Americas.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to be kicked in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been Bush’s weak spot.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
The economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It’s not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many to see as the “killer” of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted they are embracing technology in the hopes of “doing something good” for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – or directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it.”
Directors almost always receive good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his own admission, get “sick” followed up throughout the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA IS IN GROTTAFFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the realtor Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the area of the investigation into the counter-pact related to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, last week, he obtained house release, transforming it into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the realtor could travel the route of the province's city to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million bailout plan put in place by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and was, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
Yesterday’s New York Times confirmed that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to “the ones of Washington” and the world of finance, strong especially in the center of the state and the South.
The soul, in fact, has become arrogant with the vote of the one who spoke in the beginning.
This just quoted is just an example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here alone.
Whether in the United States or in Europe, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that solidify and come to light with the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, if they have strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or they don’t have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union that, divided as always between different interests and different state strategies, fails to decide any common policy.
It is the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the granting of funds: from the moment the cut is reached it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization can ever dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to account for increasingly less intangible things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, you see, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but are equally absolutely united in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So he who finds himself as a sovereign certainly has many more letters about him who is not, and to him who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation into their own hands.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of inadequate economic nature with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in an increasing number.
It seems to be advancing more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites up to now booming, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensible exception of the term, to have made their own time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and of the traditional political structures, which are manifested in an American "revolt" electoral or in the sudden changes of collective moods of these last times also, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the social collapse of the Bush administration.
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say any, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent, what from today is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially stirs me.
In the face of all this, talking about a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn’t.
The super glue for walking on the walls
Beat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like a spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to glue a 100 kilogram body onto a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecko paws, coated with microscopic hair that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more potent than the reptile's legs and at the same time "easily takes off from the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electrical current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scientists have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair that self-cleans from dust during movement over a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs alters their absorption by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices being packaged fresh associated with the intake of some medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice to reduce the health of patients, orange and apple effect.
Grapefruit juice had already been charged because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistaminic and neurological medications.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that came from this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink in case you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMEL – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “These findings are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the drug.
That is why you should always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly.
The Economic Novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and for the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, Enron bombing, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years came blamed to the economy, but that has now been revealed accurate.
"I'm surprised and a little annoyed at how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly vanished from public attention," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist,” but also a dissenter with a “very aggressive, particularly critical style against the excesses of the Bush administration’s liberalism.”
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It’s the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and to the less coarse revised interface, more consistent ones are added, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF format.
Paying attention also to the multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the dimension of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphics module, while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of modifications, in the drafting of texts, each contributor is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, over the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the subject of the free can be a hook for diffusion in the homes, it is in the business field that Open Office suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to already count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools.
And there are not even the realities that offer a training, consultation and support service ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, in the case of the known Access is the program that allows to work on the database; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third-ranked and winner of the best rower of the climber.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The analyses of Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place on the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positive doping to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, winning the paddle of the best climber.
NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy as an immigrant country has only recently been transformed into a privileged destination for "hostile" immigrants.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case demonstrates what the New York Times defines as the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is “more integration and more work” but also the country’s highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support of the Northern League.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation sought by the League also tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine people is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The pope and the president of the Republic have said: “Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI in Congress, has called for the state and the church to work together to combat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros per room
The university rental market is unaware of the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants’ union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study for a large proportion of young people due to the very high costs that the family would have to bear – explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia Studies Office – in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of widespread increase even for residents.”
Apart from that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no fee limit, sub-linked rentals.
Extraordinary interventions are necessary for Sunia, which, through the revision of the tax, can regulate prices.
Looking in detail at the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve about 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 euros for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Savings are made only if the peripheral area is changed: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding area.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policlínico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
in smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city’s economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and non-EU rents is more common, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic halls
The historic cinemas close in favour of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticulous in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory," it is as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom he shared a piece of place and so much excitement", Notes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago always won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes, which told the poetry of a cinema room in such a way that he lived the province and the nostal.
The figures given by the ANEC, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay most are the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the cause of its disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these three Italian regions have registered the largest number of new meticulous cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” notes Paolo Protti, president of ANEC, “it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all of its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
To sustain the sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that is concerned about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema monkey room both in the historic center and in the periphery.
Among the rules envisaged are tax facilitation measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
“It is an initiative that I like,” Giuseppe Tornatore observes, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true that to contrast the extra power of meticulous icons, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a subject that was always important to me: the closure of Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Paradise Cinema", which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto or Quirinale via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniformize the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Piromalli cusca".
The accusations made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria to the mayor and deputy mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association are heavy.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, named after the boss, already convicted of criminal mafia association and to indemnify 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any legal and moral norm, and common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
“The mafia family would have been allowed to officially enter the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional council Agazio Loiero does not hide that "arrangements between the bad organized life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning add to those of last July after police had announced the cutting off of the heads of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the head of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the city council.
I call into question the deputy interior minister who at the time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges “the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniformizing public administration elections over the interests of mafia families.”
When the energy is born from the waves, the great ones come down to the stage.
It is an extinct deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is being discovered now by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil was low in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was pushed aside, but now that environmental cases and the new rise in oil give momentum to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants at the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 sealed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy, more and more of these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy,” a spokesman for a company associated with the US oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It’s a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to make new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to Develop.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, because marine energy has undoubtedly a major environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good bonds between them.
The force of the waves, which makes the good move up and down, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in development, awaiting only federal approval, apart from energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and for a parking lot, using underwater turbines on the East River in New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electricity, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly about the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others approaching the shores, have invested $7 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
