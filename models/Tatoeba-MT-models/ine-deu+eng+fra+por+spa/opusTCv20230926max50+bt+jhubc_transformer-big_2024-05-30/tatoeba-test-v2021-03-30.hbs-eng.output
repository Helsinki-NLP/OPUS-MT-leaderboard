Have you decided what you're going to do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?

Is it yours?
I thought I'd have another chance at it.
He'll understand.
Tomo, we need to take a taxi to the station.
I'm trying to win her heart.
I'm not here for that.
I assumed you were busy.
She's finally asleep.
Tom laughs at Mary.
It's almost half past three.
Jump.
We know him.
I don't know if that's enough money for me.
Can you put on the curtains?
Have you ever tried?
Do not drink water from a dirty glass.
That seems inhuman to me.
Did you have lunch?
They say love is blind.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little kitten, you want some cream?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
I'm as happy as a cat in a pajama.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed to be nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he had tied his belt.
It seemed yellow to me.
I'm celebrating.
I am firmly against compromise.
Eat slowly.
Everything has its price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Keep trying. Keep trying.
She doesn't use salt when cooking.
We got off the train.
We've always been close.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
What the hell is this?
I went to the hospital.
We've never been here.
Sing!
Due to the storm, our train was delayed by an hour.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.

Don't argue.
Just be careful, Tom.
It's amazing!
I was in school.
I'll get it.
I'm in better shape than you.
He gave up.
Maybe they're somewhere around the lake.
They were all looking for Tom.
I wish I knew.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's not in shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it in detail.
Ivan is a slut.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I was going to say.
I'll call her tonight.
He went for a walk.
Tom finally realized that Mary was right.
It was a crazy year.
You're wrong, Tom.
It is impossible to say with certainty.
Tom had never left his home before.
You owe me a lot.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's like summer outside.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
They're waiting for us.
What's your story?
Go ahead.
You have no idea how right you are.
I've been looking for you.
It'll last forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
I forgot.
This knife isn't sharp.
Just blink.
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom knew French.
Everyone is the boss in their own house.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Did you see Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried to.
What school did you go to?
The clouds are getting darker.
He's gentle by nature.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.

Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
Without a doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
It was love at first sight.
Stand up.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom is still frustrated.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.

Share the tickets, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's almost no violence in this town.
They already have one.

That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're wrong.

I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
I'm proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.

I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confusing.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is that lake?
What year is your car?
- What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're too young.
Don't push yourself.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We do not have such an example.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.

Just be nice.
What should I see?

I bought this yesterday.
How do you say “cat” in Spanish?
We need to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
He speaks clearly.
I haven't seen him in a while.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her in a while.
Actually, I never met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
Save energy, you'll need it later.
This was a pleasant experience.

I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
Okay, and you?
This is undoubtedly an extremely uncomfortable situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's jogging every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
I blew my tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
What has science ever done for us?
Stop watching TV and start studying.

What are you gonna do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train's over.
Come and see us.
The young man is often thoughtless.
I don't think he knows I love you.

They need each other.
Let's go get something to eat.
That's what you think?
Can we agree to disagree with each other?
I'm trying to be careful.
Always trouble when it comes to my kid.
Not yet.
One day she wants to study abroad.

I don't know.
I'm convinced.

I worked on it day after day.

Where there's grass, there's no water, where there's water, there's no grass.
My friend got 95 points on the math exam.

You're in trouble.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
There is no word "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Shut up, Tom.
This bag is mine.
Tom left before I got here.
Tell us a story about ghosts!
I hope Tom's safe.
We've been talking about it all night.
I want to live in the city.
What are you going to do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
Your desire is a command to me.
I'll call her tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is the base.
Try it again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
She was educated in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
I haven't been told anything.
The fire spread to the neighboring building before the firefighters arrived.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary did.
I thought this was going to happen months ago.
The bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And this one's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
The black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
It is one of the biggest summer music festivals.
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Shut your mouth and sit down.
What the hell is this?
He's gone.
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
He's an American.
Tom only talks to Mary.
Without a doubt.
The first lesson is easy.
You've grown up so fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I'm pretty good at doing multiple things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
She's in a bad mood.
Am I the only one going to a party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let your imagination go.
Okay, and you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go into that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why me, exactly?
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years have it been since I last saw you?
If you do, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a melem for the soul.
Tom was silent for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered in your stupid business.
The light disappeared by itself.
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
Ask the cops!
We have five fingers on each hand.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom saves to buy a yacht.
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
What do the newspapers say?
The system has been repaired after three years of volunteer work.
I need your signature.

I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
Naoko lives in the White House.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective travel link to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire western region.

Hello, how are you?
She received four e-mails.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are targeting something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without any difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I just don't want to do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
They have the right to vote.
I find it hard to express in words what I think.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
Swipe right into the next corner.
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I listened to the music.
Are you involved in this?
Do you know why I'm here?
I hope he doesn't notice my mistake.
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim like he used to.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom works too much.
Avoid addicts on the color diluent.
I liked that one.
He did not hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller-coasters?
We're out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's a good time today.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
Proletarians of all countries, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom could not attend the meeting because he was ill.
Tell me why you did that.
Italy is located in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
You have a right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work more.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom turned around the room, unable to calm down.
Can I get a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come over sometime?
She wonders how this is possible.
Santa Claus lives on the North Pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please, go.
Look at that.
Wake up! Wake up!
You picked the handsome one.
Look how big it is!
I tried to be nice.
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I find it hard to talk about my feelings.
I'll give you everything you want.
That's their book.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive.
You should come home.
Alice smiled.
She can't be bribed.
You want to turn off the lights?
I'll save you.
I'll let you know.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic finger moves, creating music that's very pleasant to listen to.
Heavy winds broke a lot of branches off the trees last night.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
We must prepare the ground for negotiation.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
They laughed because of his mistake.
The road to a man's heart leads through his stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.

I got off at the wrong bus station.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
People were kind to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
Dr. Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.

Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom's going to do.
I'm fat.
In order to play the choir, you need to be able to read the notes.
Tom fell asleep.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Apparently, I was too optimistic.
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
You haven't finished yet?
You're very untrained.
He's making good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowing a foreign language is good for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give himself preference over the interests of others.
I'm eating here.
It's okay. It's okay.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was named captain of the football team.
Why are you still awake? You should go to bed.
I was at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Deaf, insensitive children can sometimes grow up to be sociopaths.
I'd like him to be with you.
It's the job of the police to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you pass me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
The hatred of others is unknown to her.
This will make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
What time can you come?
The monks were able to play tennis in the monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep your children away from medications.
Who's Tom, is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I might be dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
The game can be postponed until next week.
I have a soul.
Drive to work in an hour and a half.
That's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's right here.
I'll make something up.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
Do you drink coffee?
Some of us think such views are pure madness.
It's working.
Somebody could get hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary while he was here.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to take this job.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
She's Chinese.
I don't drink vodka.
We need to be smart.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs it.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled a fatter end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more worried about you than the future of Japan.
I couldn't help but feel sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about 100 books so far.
I promoted to the skin.
Come and play with us.
And that was only with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know it exists.
Did you write down the number?
That's not a reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on the math exam.
The worst headaches are caused by insufficiently understood ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Examine this.
What's your name?
They're trying.
My future is in your hands.
It's a fake, isn't it?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom is cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Please help us find this card.
Can you tell the difference between silver and tin?
Hands up!
I don't practice as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
It's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having any fun with anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water it is impossible to live.
I've been playing the piano for a long time, so I can still play a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sister's?
The battle lasted for a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
The mother and daughter were two generations.
We're finally here!
He's in good hands.
He said he had to work two hours a day in the garden.
Apples and pears are given, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
The professor's excuse is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to exercise.
I love you! I love you!
I'm really proud of that.
We were in the last place.
I made a contribution.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't speak it.
It doesn't really look like you.
She achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
Madness has crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This is not a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
It's like I don't know!
Let's not talk about this now.
Have some fun.
It's time to say goodbye.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
Perform about the meeting is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What the hell is this?
What are you eating at all?
I don't like being convicted.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes for as long as he's alive.
Just be careful.
Let's discuss the options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything will be fine.
I was wondering.
It was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go check it out.
Some of us hate it.
"This came to you." "Uh..." "Well, do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to take pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write a review of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a review to Mac." "...Yes." "What did you say to her?"
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I get through this?
I don't want to take any more time.
I go to church just out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day like a lion than a hundred years like a sheep.
"Did he explain it?" "Yes."
Not every lamp is magical.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom will wait.
What's going to happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students did not know how to respond.
She's ashamed of lying.
I'm not a night bird.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
It's good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who's supposed to do that.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit the torch before entering the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth in what Tom says.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out of here!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have collapsed and the knight fell off the horse.
I haven't forgotten.
There are islands at sea.
I'm investigating this right now.
Mini skirts are fashionable again.
What are we really looking for?
She's accomplished her goal.
He can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn't understand much of what they were saying to each other.
This medicine will relieve your headache.
He disappeared without a trace.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what both of them like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes by train.
He's addicted to Starbuck's coffee.
The book is on the table.
The two sides will make speeches this week.
I'm planning on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
The cardboard is stronger than the paper.

We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Everybody says I'm weird.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you can remember can help.

Tom's better now than he used to be.
Tom and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for my opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is the desire of a man for eternal life. To be fulfilled by more than oneself, and to become fully
Water is a liquid.

Follow me. Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
There's no equal to him.
It's all right with me.
Obviously, Tom's sick.

I'm crying.
I'm sorry.
Stop your self-pity.

Take some.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

I'd buy that one.
This goes beyond all boundaries.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.

I was definitely lucky.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose sentence this is.

I have a few gifts.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Translating is not as easy as many people think.

Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree we fell and found that it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
You want some fruit juice?

Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?

Based on the data I gave you, what story would you go out with?

She came by herself.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your brother.
Tom lost his senses.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He doesn't miss anything.
Tom will take a look.
I'm wondering if anyone could help me, I have a cell phone that's just showing an error message.
I'm surprised.
They were all smiling.
I miss her.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.

It's all right with you.
Do what you want, I don't care at all.
He expects us to help him.
Who the hell are you?
Call me any time, I always have a shoulder to cry on.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
Oh, that's good.
I don't want to tease you.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Thank you for coming!

This is the beginning of a new era.
Mary looks cute no matter what she wears.
Shit happens.
Watch it!

Does he love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm awkward.
Yesterday, I was happy.
The way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Husbands and wives should help each other as long as they live.
All we need is water.
I wonder if Tom likes dancing as much as Mary.
What would you like to know?
Now is not the best time.
He's not a child anymore.

I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You're the dullest person I know.
Get in touch with Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that information.
I didn't do it.
I have a few friends.
I have to find her.
I can't wait.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
Just a moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you're done.
Give me a call.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.

Actually, I never met Tom.
Which one's easier?

What are you supposed to do?
I've always liked Tom better.
Where's Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're ridiculous.
Are Tom and Mary Really Married?
The horses are sleeping.
Let me try another one.
You work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
The stories of Snorri Sturluson, among other things, tell of the spread of Christianity in Norway through violence.
Answer me right away.

Am I that different?
I got stuck.
I assumed you were busy.
How long have you been running away?
This elegant gilded necklace with hearts is a necklace that will "shake up your world".

Where did I go wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
We heard her cry.
It helped me a lot.
You don't have to scream, I'm not deaf.
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
We don't have a choice.
Baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
She is currently violent, she should be avoided.
I'm just deflecting.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
Tell him I'm innocent.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
I'll visit him in a few weeks.
Italy is not Greece.
It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We're lost, aren't we?
We're not gonna let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
What's that?
He surrendered.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is a big, friendly dog in a small room, and every time he waves his tail, he knocks down a chair.
I don't have a ticket.
The doctor works in the hospital.
Nothing's happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You'll be famous.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatoeba.
It's all different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth must be told.
Look how much it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late for the accident.
I always eat fruit and oatmeal for breakfast.
You think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom told us he didn't want to work for us.
I'm so happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that the water quality be checked once a year in the pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it is really hard for people to turn their attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes, or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a great void.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of dogs barking.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written to Mary in a long time.
This story tells us interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," Mike said.
I'm not going with you.
You be careful.
Could I interrupt you for a moment?
I hate science.
The students did not know how to respond.
Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't mind them, they won't mind you either.
Good intentions are important.
I've already thought about it.
Men remain children all their lives.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Come on, admit it.
You and I are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were sleeping.
I'm just looking around.
Where is the beach?
Do you want to know something specific?
You're welcome.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not that way.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students were at the meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
Oh, that's good.
Who's Tom, is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun, I don't want to do that.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Did you see my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters think Maria is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom won't vote in this election.
I bought some flowers.
I'm sure you'll do well.
She came back from the hospital.
I don't think I'm going to read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What will happen now?
I brought you a cup of coffee.
Make a place.
He is also very popular in Australia.
Someone's called.
You be careful.
Winter is a time of snow.
Under what name?
What are you going to do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is a Greek.
Be careful with your wishes, they might come true.
Tom is a third-year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
That's how it came, that's how it went.
Give him time.
Who waits, waits.
I'll have to say, yes.
We've never been separated.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor examined her thoroughly.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 percent of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
These are artificial tears.
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you have read that?
Try it again.
That's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
It is said that a new restaurant has been built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move quietly.
When the fire broke out, he slept a lot.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought of that.
Childhood sickness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is mere speculation, it is possible that in the future there will be evidence to support it.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
He wouldn't like it.
I'll have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom parked twice.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back here.
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to the protection of moral and material interests arising from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the creator.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
Tom is hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went for a walk.
Are there other options?
The amount for the work done and interest on the invested capital was several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who pays.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three of the boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't completely agree with you.
It's a beautiful day today.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think that we women have an extra sense.
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Merino's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in the southeastern part of Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I'll send a letter to my brother who lives in Sapor.
The politician had sticky fingers, because 5% of every contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought it was my job.
I'm a professor.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear that Tom hates us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to anyone.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write a report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you go, Tom?
This man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is no better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours a day.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
You're fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'll take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, not his.
We have four lessons of French each week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded that Denmark give him money.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left leg today.
He broke into my house.
The bathroom is upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It is a typical Gothic church.
It was a presentation that appealed to the public.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you very much!
Keep the bag.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom surrender?
Europeans took precedence over other civilizations 500 years ago.
It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom threw away the flies.
He abruptly quit smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to refute what he had said.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black, and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The cup's on the table.
That pisses me off.
Is it still bright out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
Would you like me to look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what's your business?
I wish that had come to mind.
I drink milk.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw the cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
I have no idea what was going on in his head so that he would reject such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How's it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean it up now.
You've tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Whoa!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom is strict or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us had a potato salad.
Come by yourself.
To be a good child, you need to go to bed and get up early.
Okay, and you?
I think I'm going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I made a promise.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not an easy sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a bedbug.
That's what it was supposed to be like.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, after he became a victim of a conspiracy, he is convicted of treason and sent to life imprisonment.
You're irrational.
My French is bullshit.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
My mother chose this curtain.
We're not both as rich as we'd like.
It sucks.
Can you tell Tom I'm here?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Do you know how to cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French on my own.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weakness.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
One foot in the grave
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm compassionate.
Tom is dissatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
It's crazy like electricity.
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your letter earlier.
Do not drink water from a dirty glass.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today were written by me.
That doesn't scare me the least.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
Oh, good to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks a lot different than it used to be.
Is it yours?
Why are rabbit ears so big?
I'm a runner.
I'm not singing.
Souls don't exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Oh, yes.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things on the go.
You work too much, sit down and get some rest.
This one's really cool.
Not a word to anyone.
I really enjoyed it.
This can be trusted to some extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Kedah.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry, I'm late for the session.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I tried at all.
That river runs shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this composition.
It's five o'clock in the morning in Brazil.
Tom hinted that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't so fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
It is not taught in school.
Is it clean?
Don't let me get out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish cannot live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting! Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Move! Move!
Please, wait a little longer.
I'm not gonna do that!
I'm tired of fighting.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
Every part!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could be upset.
I just want to get out of here.
Dania continued to follow Fadilo’s example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day, Bill goes fishing.
Don't let it get away with such a good chance.
What time do you have breakfast?
Just be careful.
He's in his first year of college.
I was looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Can I have your vocabulary?
My fluent knowledge of the language is sufficient for many situations, but not for expressing my often contradictory emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a stray.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book is on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I'm not blaming you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know this girl from somewhere.
I climbed once.
Show me the photos!
She wanted to become a nurse.
I'm sorry to bother you all the time.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
That's wonderful!
I'm a bitch.
Can you pick us up?
Can you get there on time?
Strange that the postman hasn't come yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How can we prevent this from happening?
His novels are favorites among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'll buy a boat soon. What kind of insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not an American, he's an Englishman.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Have you ever been fined for speeding?
I'll be right upstairs.
We've got to go.
Tom is a mechanic.
His misfortune has taught me a lot.
Are we ready to go?
Why? Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Like most eighteen-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi has written a lot of musical works for the bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right thigh in a bicycle accident in France on Sunday.
Where there's a lot of grandmothers, there's a lot of kids.
Tom is tense like a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just a slap on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were incredible.
Choose one of them.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes were cracked.
Have you recovered completely?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a stew.
Don't move!
The incident was filmed by an observer.
Did I drop it?
Are you happy?
This is the dumbest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew that Tom didn't know how to speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by his looks.
It's in vain.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often rapists in childhood.
Meet me with Tom.
After a long discussion, in the end, I did things randomly.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves on words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to me for dinner yesterday.
Look how big he is!
The living truth.
You're very uninvited.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his clients.
Tom came out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have interfered with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom is merciless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
Termites eat trees.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This is supposed to work.
You betrayed me.
You don't have to judge a man by his looks.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll make speeches tomorrow.
What is this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
I do, too.
It's different than what I was expecting.
Don't lie.
What are your plans, then?
The kids are sleeping.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in England, has a rather long history.
Tom closed the door.
I wasn't having fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and spent a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
It smells delicious.
The first phase is finished.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You're the dullest person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought dozens of pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French taught at your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna be fine.
You're important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't count on it.
I'm used to not being liked by anyone.
The brakes whistled.
Find tom.
You really made me proud.
You can see everything in black.
Just like a bean.
I'm a little worried now.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a song he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
Just be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do that.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
Hopefully tomorrow will be a nice day.
Mary nodded.
Let's sit down.
Come and take a look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm quitting.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters that Mary sent him.
Go swim a little with Tom.
He's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A women's chiffon is not complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the toilet here?
Happy Easter!
Tom helped me save some dinars by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
There's nothing you can do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Go! Go!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom's gonna live.
Please read between the lines.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.
I had lunch in a hurry.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message to Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want to want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never came in time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
As little as we know about her origins, at least we can be sure that she is the pilot of Evangeliona.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than stronger.
People used to write books with typewriters.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope that's not the case.
Give me one example.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
How barbaric!
What's tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
When the cat is gone, the mouse wheel waters.
We need it from Tom.
The Emperor of Japan and the King of Spain.
It's Alina's book.
Will we see Tom again?
The world was on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie drinks milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's all quiet again.
I'm loyal.
Can we order, please?
What's he doing?
Otherwise, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm pissed.
Slow down, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I'm not going to Bust with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a squirrel.
Like in the good old days.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
It doesn't look like you.
He's always here between five and six o'clock.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like stubborn people.
Sitting all day is bad for you.
The rainy season starts in June.
You always work.
That's perfectly normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall looked smooth and impenetrable.
Do you hear anything?
He has two cars.
He's probably still going to be angry.
He greeted us and left.
Welcome to Tatoeba.
I see, but I don't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We're close friends.

You're the boss.
He took Jane out to dinner.
Who broke the cup?

You can't blame Tom for everything.
I feel good now.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
She can't stop us.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?

How old are you really?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You've tried.

I can't fix the car myself.
Zini!
Please, hurry up.
Tom nodded his head.
Should we tell someone?
He was flooded with cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom meant.
Don't get mad.
His memory loss is more a mental problem than a physical one.
He exhaled.

He worked ten hours non-stop.
This one's pretty cool.
This publishing company is solvable.
Choose one.
How did you find out where Tom was?

I'm not at all worried.
