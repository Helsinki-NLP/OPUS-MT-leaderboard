Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a noticeable weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the party of the populist right.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People’s Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still is the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst, literally catastrophic, results in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the postwar era and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage over the SPO in terms of preference.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government sink.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, Deputy Chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer was heard.
Observers believe that this could already be achieved on Monday at the party’s exceptional presidency meeting.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the way to the constant and approximate starting point of the election results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the strengthening of both parties of the right-wing populist Union - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same would be repeated from the year 1999 when the populists negotiated with the populists (then generates the FPO was a year for the BZ).
Haider has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has slightly lost and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the 4% limit and is therefore not part of the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, it could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not resolved then yes, then yes, this cooling would be achieved with certainty," he said after the meeting, which was organized on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling under whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
Then you can request the exoneration of the cause and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises appealing to the High Court and then the pardon would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to get the convicted person “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
Moreover, he said that such support is already obtained by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he insisted before his colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister circumvented the answer to the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he just noted.
A Czech arbitrates a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, depicting Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small lost spot in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its head, the director of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides to this day a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to this day that themselves carry the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the firm ground
The coastal countries have begun today to fiercely dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called Continental Border which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all resources of the Continental Border.
"Continental Edge is the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the border of the sea coast, and often, to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the Continent Border must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a number of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist assistance commission.
To date, the Commission has processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have emerged,” adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine domain.
However, New Zealand also got it - the seabed surface that the commission granted it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, nearly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in their study.
The profit that will be derived from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
At the end of the mainland border begins the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity".
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is governed by treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine," Director Mikulka says emphatically, adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its contractually defined regime."
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the faculty to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the liberation of the hostages the German special forces command was in the place of action
To solve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue action.
Therefore, at the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron, the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent liberation, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted Germany’s help to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately, that moment did not come," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible bailout payments.
In the meantime, rescued and healthy people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", five tourists and special forces have to return on Airbus from Germany's air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives disapproves of the Salvation Package
The first U.S. House of Representatives failed a large $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected by 227 votes to 206 the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties did not reach a majority for the program that should limit the disorder in the financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to vote even though the plan is not so popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6% or 600 points.
The reason for that was investor concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
It rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers register the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German tour organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened conjuncture the Germans' desire to travel remains the same.
As reported on Monday by the Germany Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the market research institute GfK, the reserves for the autumn months had already increased in number.
Thus, the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more than in 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed for approximately the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened price of the dollar, especially travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destinations of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and power prices are rising, in this case travel expenses are "better computable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months travel was well booked, so sales volume compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared with last year, fell.
It's my first Oktoberfest.
The party hits under the open sky at the Endless Spa, the beer in one-liter jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer suits.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don’t have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian suit tailored to her needs.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there’s one thing that unites us: we’re barely in a tent, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with photos – it’s very flattering especially because I’m first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with traditional Bavarian costumes to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; none seems to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets rare looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A Munich girl draws my attention to my apron that she had dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, the middle is virgin, on the right side she is engaged, behind she is widow."
Oh, God, now I'm clutching behind the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don’t care about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it says “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking, their knotted ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is named Bob, he is from England and is also at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "or".
He told me after I put his glass of a liter of beer next to him that he had just drunk.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most people think that's a trash can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the sanitary groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear every time in a group - suddenly there are always four people bringing the covered walkways from one tent to the other.
That works like most visitors: they come sober, they come back drunk.
It is not seen who suffers from the degrees of alcoholemia and is on the walks.
"They're the ones who can't do it anymore," answered a nurse answering my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Accident Victim Identified by Police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital has been identified after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey pretended to be a member of the European Union, the European powers nestled in the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inland Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in a neo-Renaissance style.
At least, that’s what the guides say.
The building is set to time the end of the platforms and carries two towers in front, one for each corner, making everyone look like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once the vaulted box is passed, there is no doubt about what was the greatness of the company that this was the westernmost door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a “latecomer” in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this cured railway to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Their railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has decayed and remained out of the story.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The government’s Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish government maintains excellent good relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed into a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shakes, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by mid-built shopping malls and "power pastries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to make a deal.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Costume, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its own country.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
He has to do both.
"But surely at some point," I asked him, "could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replies, "doesn't want to embarrass that choice."
I would like to underline one point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far has recited to me almost in memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States of America as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again to Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts go back to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt as to which continent this fascinating country must claim.
Life to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (skeleton, September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were finishing our 20s – we just refused to give it up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the changing mythological being of the forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or messiaen, regardless if not accompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
You just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxing, nor too florid.
Whatever the musical scoundrel, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve watched over 100 of their concerts and can honestly say that I’ve never, by no means, been disappointed – otherwise, I’ve been inspired many times by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two very well-known war horses around the world."
We'll miss you a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) you state that "in 1946 he resumed his studies of economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, a season during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to skip this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second assault for Honda supersellers
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
In addition to this, there are refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow you to save more fuel.
Evolution vs. Revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among other things, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics should be noted.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million units of jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 units of Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% growth in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the heads of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to largely mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a compact five-door hybrid – 4.37 meters long – that the Japanese company expects to market around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in partnership in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the axle distance to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will feature two 1.2 and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-liter mechanic achieves a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 laps.
This engine - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a cost of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Regarding the previous engine, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horsepower, now has 100.
This 100-horse Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of the bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious Tokyo University in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Director of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the bee’s compound eyes, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to said object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
“As soon as it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be deflected up or down, nor diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allow it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require storing information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we’re not talking about gigas of memory, not even mega.”
This is the first step in developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced to standard cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the lithium ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the drive with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Tiemble before you mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages at banks of questionable solvency, they have created a fun and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the 'Hotel of bad credits'... or the mess.
The tricky aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
Certainly, it has useful information, but little detail.
It’s more a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because if you buy a better house we don't even talk...
Morgan Stanley sells shares to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after discovering a provisional deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of three billion dollars.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on a unit price of $29, or 28% above its current exchange rate.
The Morgan Stanley stock, however, lost 6.79 percent to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” explained Juan Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to behave much more prudently than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: on Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for nearly $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, explained Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought the participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG can convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within a year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of nearly 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had relied heavily on his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock market price fall by half as the cost of collateral against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost fell back last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, he was the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" scored 28%, 7% of the votes were null votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to the "yes", estimating it to be between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly", he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the Observer Mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a 444-point text that consolidated the " new socialism " advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution entails increasing the power of the State over the economy, reserved for it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the Head of State, who can serve up to two consecutive four-year terms each and have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally foresees a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 abducted people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been liberated by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good on arrival at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane to Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical tests, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the hijackers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown hijackers while enjoying an all-terrain safari in a deserted area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carried aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of gunshots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," the official said.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrain vehicle aboard which contained the hijackers, of whom he killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also claimed that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by that group.
Lyrics - Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture fait les manchettes and occupies the current election campaign.
It's better like this.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve to death?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 charitable people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with little money piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and desperation when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The states of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s economic competition officer.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer from the eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves more than a year ago, therefore the decisions taken with regard to the Bank, in a sense, can be considered as precedents.
According to the decision made in the early hours of Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including mainly the activities – mainly insurance – purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amro.
Fortis’ actions began a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85,000 employees this bank is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company’s shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current share prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The bank’s management blamed the sharp fall in Fortis shares on the insecurities of the US market in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, the stocks showed already a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has made a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they would not have to worry, they would not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far, no panic occurred, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the chicken coop
In the U.S., life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see the data on drug purchases.
The privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which binds the use of recipe data in all cases to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we entrust the henhouse to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the price of the insurance and the amount of reimbursement of the customer’s health condition dependent and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Earlier they sent the client to medical examination and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily obtains from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and health of the customer.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is practically incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even set a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has hardly anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is, for example, that some medications are multipurpose, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headaches and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the former is not.
Special companies were established to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
Authorities are already forcing them to do so, although they have not been fined for negligence so far.
Some companies also recently compile the results of lab tests and by combining them with drug consumption data they get more accurate information about the patient’s state of health.
More and more company have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The Congress is already before the draft law that gives the authority for control of companies specializing in the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because if not, the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, after all, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutual trading partners, this issue in addition to the other largely global problems dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have yet to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, Chief Foreign Policy Representative, welcomed Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double their trade to more than 100 billion euros in five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Thus, the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally harmonised, so air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among the EU’s trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism – all forms of terrorism – and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also stressed, although both sides bear great responsibility for their failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will cling to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, just as the climate conference next year should reach a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by fifty percent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder rising food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where – in a bilateral meeting – he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as an honorary guest.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with an Italy point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
This will be followed by a meeting with the print at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing over the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane have been found, the millionaire missing on September 3, 2007 as he flew over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on an elevated plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the area of the Nevada Sierra of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
“The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have confirmation that this is what Steve Fossett was flying about on the day of his disappearance,” he said at a press conference.
The commissioner said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
The 63-year-old millionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (NTSB) has announced that a squad of investigators has been sent a few hours after the sighting of the remains, which has identified the device: it is owned by the Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada by a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primitives.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world tour in an air balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world round by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also for having flown at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An out-of-the-box SUV with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of innovation in this sector.
Due to the out-of-traditional content, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that would dominate the central street of Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the Avenida Como, it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the image will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultra Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia has been added a small group (few units, in fact) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-coloured flags showing the city of origin of the militants: Saturday night they have been removed so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, making them easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) at the time, none that had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been denied the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry expects to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (ban of access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) that prevents attending not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans won't stand in a stadium anymore.
Fortunately!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: let those few fifty be added to others.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way," the Interior Ministry said.
That’s why, “well-opened eyes” especially in view of Wednesday’s National game in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia braces.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also count on a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, i.e. the secret service, which deals with problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that was before by Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of public safety in Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
“I do not make the sociologist – adds the No.1 of the Observatory – the reactions are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to the anthem of Mameli: these too are not a crime, but if they allow, they are also not of education.
