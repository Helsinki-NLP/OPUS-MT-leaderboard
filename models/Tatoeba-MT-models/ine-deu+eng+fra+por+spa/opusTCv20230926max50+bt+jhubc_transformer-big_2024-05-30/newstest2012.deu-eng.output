No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the request to abolish, within the framework of a novelty of the Criminal Code, the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the detained Prime Minister, was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the application for mitigation of penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for concluding an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet in force, the appeal of the convicts to the courts is scheduled for December.
Timoshenko himself referred to the verdict as political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of bias of the court.
The request, Section 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan defeat
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners can be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council made itself known to the customary law of the Shar<0xC4><0xAB><0xCA><0xBF>a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you will soon cut off the hand.
Even women should quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, any apostates will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united by the Qur’an from each other’s opposing tribes.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that is hardly conceivable and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly suit the mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the unbelieving dogs.
For their apology, perhaps only the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after each successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a gunfight, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians dismissed themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, with no benefit whatsoever.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the homeowners get rid of a concern - namely the expulsion of the cruisers.
But do the mineral oil companies get black gold at a mockery price even without occupation?
The West can hardly boast, at last, of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not do this, the Shar<0xC4><0xAB><0xCA><0xBF>a representatives will ruin them.
The Beginning of a New Crisis Era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm swept through Europe.
Each country published its GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, with Germany and France growing.
Today, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are keeping an eye on not only Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, while France’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and, according to Tsch, the trend of slowing growth in economic performance was confirmed.
The results are worse than analysts’ predictions.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally calculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Across the eurozone and the EU, the economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2% compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds rose to 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are beginning to feel problems...
Returns on Czech sovereign bonds remain below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, there are rumors that the ECB will become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the climbing game in an in-depth report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech team also won 1-0 thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant <0xC4><0x8C>ech’s and the hero of the day Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro, thus redeeming their ticket for the football championship.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they were able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half.
The lucky birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech selection will join the European Championships next year, it is also pleasing that a premium of about 200 million will be added to domestic football.
From the first few minutes, there was a lot of fighting football.
Both teams combined for a long time and thus was mainly played around the center line.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained unchanged and the wide shots in front of the penalty area were successfully defended by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s core program.
They were a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday afternoon and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a live sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to declare that they are ready to protect their country’s core program, if necessary, also with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran has not seemingly given up on its efforts for a nuclear weapon for a long time.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon before entering the complex and then announced death to the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of a planned attack to paralyze Iran’s nuclear program, the Israeli press said the Isfahan nuclear enrichment facility at NATO’s attack target would also be used.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: it does not eat breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This once again shows how important for a person’s healthy development is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half as often on the table as in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had potatoes for dinner on the eve of the enlightenment campaign under the motto "obesity is not a coincidence".
In families with thickheads, sports is not exactly one of the favorite occupations, but it also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic being interviewed.
This was the second year of the “Obesity is not a coincidence” campaign, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 students from the 4th and 8th grades participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the frightening increase in the number of children with obesity or even obesity.
“Only half of the children surveyed reported, for example, eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-dinner-dinner bread five times a day – one of the main requirements for a healthy diet,” according to one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of pupils’ families eat breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
The worst of all was the finding that in every tenth family there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey test revealed that unhealthy potatoes are much more often consumed in families of overweight children.
And almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do - that is, only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own meal plan based on the opportunities offered in terms of appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweet dishes.
"The great popularity of sweet lemonades is alarming," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, the main dish, pasta won just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like legumes and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the enlightening lecture "Adiposity is not a coincidence", in many cases, there was a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating," the results of the project indicate.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give preference to ordinary water.
The children also crossed poultry or fish much more often in the questionnaire as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less noodles or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a little bit of a grudge that this was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
I had no idea what was yet to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the dressing of problematic figures and a seminar on how to do it "on the pitch".
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam gets, the more information and practical tasks we have ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
After all, that is most of us.
Some have a too short neck, the others a too young figure without neat curves and still others are fluffy.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or highlight the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with a large bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-emphasized without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least have a piece tailored to fit.
You will not regret this, because well-fitting clothing is simply priceless.
In fact, in such a tailor-made skirt one feels much better than in one of the rod, which always slides too high and slides down in the waist, etc.
Boylike figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, bushes, applications, embroidery or riveting.
With this amount of information and figure types, I’m glad I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my mind.
And yet I am afraid that given the assigned homework, it is almost impossible to do.
Each of the participants was assigned a celebrity, for which she was to come up with suitable outfits - daywear and evening dresses.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I’m cheering, because that’s much better for me personally than, for example, dressing Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably gained a hundred kilos lately (well, that’s a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut the garments out of magazines or search on the Internet, print them out and then graphically edit them.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
In fact, the stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was equally spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And embedded stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
All you need to do is crawl up your sleeves or collar and the whole look will look completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But the most important thing to me was the following advice: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," Jakub said.
I finally understand why we have to put all these teachings together, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often see something completely different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographs.
So for a ten-page fashion story (say ten outfits) you need to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
All of this must be taken into account in the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> also confirmed this.
All you need to do is look at Madonna, a not-so-brilliant singer whose image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Even well-known personalities often think this is thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look is secondary).
And if any of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose on us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then all you need to do is google to find out with certainty that the boulevard press is writing, the corresponding celebrity has gone over or down, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on fashion and then "build the outfit together".
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he styles and he must be a skilled psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and standing up for their opinion.
"If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and add nice pieces, we can't take out the whole wardrobe and say, 'Oh my God, that's terrible.'"
“You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can wear,” Mario says.
He also showed us very concretely what a so-called "plate bag" must contain.
So such a bag that you tie to the waist and in which you carry all the necessary properties.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, reels for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are not pulled back, if it is too big, or if it is too big (Ssault)
But so that we can not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We were sticking and we were sticking...
The scissors should not even touch the shoes, so as not to damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned above is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard during the second weekend of the continuation course.
One thing has now become clear to me - dedicating yourself to styling on a professional level is not a child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review:
The original carefree ride is made possible by a series of completely avoidable, dilettante errors for the routine ride to the early stage.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions for the most part, but what good is this, if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the store tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already aged game series "Need for Speed" to a new dimension again and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious how the fit passages turn out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are accustomed to with NFS, in the end it is much different than expected.
Sure - potentially it's quite decent arcade racing, but overall, the game is diminished by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a fundamentally incomprehensible laziness of game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, you are introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you sit at the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole range of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
It doesn’t seem like the game will offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the drive through the desert, through the autumnal landscape or high up through the deep snowy landscape seems visually very pleasant.
From time to time, atypical elements bring a little variation into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts your vision.
In the mountains, you have to be careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are quite well built up.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overcome the required number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And then there's the police, who want to mess you up.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It’s more about some interactive animations in which Jack runs away from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So, nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are far fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (in particular, only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage, because at least this element does not have a chance to get bored - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not pluck any trees, on the other hand, one could not claim that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you need to look elsewhere.
But for an action-packed race, the local driving model will still be quite fair, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in good order.
Real problems only arise after a certain amount of time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
A game of this kind is hardly expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea of how the car behaves before an impact on any object, then obviously everything is not okay.
Typical example: When passing by or passing by on opposite cars, you "strip" the other car only slightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you get into the swing and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car just goes to waste.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t matter anymore, it’s always annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then the game throws you back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
Once you’ve exhausted it, everything starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but you shouldn’t rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the restart doesn’t help, as nothing else helps but learning the critical section out of your head.
It’s very unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves have to be passed in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not pass through.
In other places, you will always find "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the opponent passing in front of a playing two opposing cars, but by the time you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass or brake them.
And no matter when you get there, everything is designed in such a way that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The contractors have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and here again regardless of the time.
The most crazy thing is to finish the game on the long bridge, which you pass in the opposite direction.
The contractor obviously has to get one out here on the devil's ass.
And if he is in front of you, then of course he takes your sights, so that at first you drive your own car a few times in Klump.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it will quickly lose you the joy of the game.
And that’s a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game as a whole is quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost don’t know where one’s head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what the "guilty" is - the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in such a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car during the races.
You should not overlook the gas stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode also goes the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual locations that you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to the higher driver level, various items must be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, this is connected to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares its own achieved results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you can get by car into a subway tunnel (my way), where you can ride long on the rails in the dark (my way).
On the tacho, figures look between 150 and 200 km/h (for me), but suddenly from the back comes a subway and drives an uncompromising dirt.
In our editorial office, we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that in some exciting moments the frame rate becomes slower and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
This, however, particularly applies to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use to you anyway.
The sound playback is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to reach as large a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "of everyone something" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game weren’t diminished by the aforementioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have argued with the chest tone of belief that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
This is how the game seems to be unfinished.
It’s a great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared to face these mistakes with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions tangible."
I didn’t expect such a fierce war to break out.”
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth out and everyone will get used to their new role," said Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply in her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "Understandable and Open about Europe", she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could have envied so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism was loud enough that he was too unobtrusive - a grey official who hadn't grown up in such a role, but I have to say, it has blown everyone's breath, how well he has accepted the matter.
He is a person who is able to listen patiently to and communicate with twenty-seven Member States and who, above all, has a clear idea of how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our oil makers Quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda by which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the fall of the government during the Presidency as a great negativity that had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently in full swing.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was quite hectic not only during the Presidency, but also during the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And the seven-year budget of the EU still needs to be approved, which makes things much more complicated, especially because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which economic sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which will be less - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Understandably about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s horrible abbreviations, foreign words and technical jargon that no one understands.
How can I, as a citizen, know if in Brussels people are really thinking about curly or round cucumbers and variously large bananas, or if someone is actually trying to ban us from quargels?
She would also have liked to use the EU’s soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
A Europe of two or different speeds in perspective
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics, who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me thinks, 'Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is this your V4 again?'
According to Vicenové, the EU expects in the future, above all, tough rules on the budgetary policies of the member states.
As much more real than a "European federation", she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want it and those that don’t want it should be quietly away.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately results in a strong 'Europe of different speeds'", expects Vicenová.
In this regard, she also commended the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the whole EU must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.

If you wanted to look for a suitable word that best characterizes IBM’s strategy, then that would probably be the word “longevity.”
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" became the hallmark for the future giant's life (and at the same time the title of the company's in-house magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
A well-thought-out system
Watson was already socially caring for his employees in the 1930s - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Ba<0xC4><0x8D>a in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had paid vacation as one of the first American employees, insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful pay-back system for best new employees.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant at promoting talent from the start – as one of the first companies in the world IBM lifted any discrimination – and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan to replace Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for 30 years and has previously held the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said the Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it makes a difference to be only present on the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo called "Big Blue" because of familiarity, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents, and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or even the floppy disk.
With a market capitalization of approximately $220 billion, IBM was the second-largest technology company (just after Apple) this year, surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computer IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you shouldn’t get emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundation walls on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Promising technologies
IBM’s profits are largely driven by services, software and hardware, accounting for one-fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-disposing assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-proof technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept over the world for the first time.
Here too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives the current crisis without harm.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120% since 2008 and the company’s net profit is growing steadily.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed – only the values can’t be changed.
That is why it is also to be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
Founded a hundred years ago in New York City, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name – Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was not until 1924 that the name IBM was adopted – it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM company was laid by the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They possessed technologies such as the famous stick card clocks to record the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of the rival company, to help him lead the company.
This leader then even overshadowed the founders of IBM - based on Watson's ideas to this day, the company's invincible culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM began, as the name suggests, with the manufacture and distribution of all kinds of machines for trading - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson ran the company, he doubled its sales to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped guide NASA's flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous man's flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers with the same computer architecture – the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of that time, was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it acquired the consultancy part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers, thereby fully entering the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid off over the past three years is the “Smart Planet” concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a wise way in areas not even planned before, for example to improve the situation in traffic and in city administration.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the platform "Smart Commerce", which is intended to help traders guide the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and has a world-class research team dedicated to the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) became their lover by the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his rosary dream and return home.
But now it is finally over with patience and she has set herself clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner," explained D. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová.
If Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová had sheltered singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová in her own house, she probably would not have even dreamed of how it would turn out with her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days on her urges, Joseph immediately went with her.
He even publicly acknowledged that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, and it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband – but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not be welcomed home with open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not drive him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being with whom I still have some ties," said Ms. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová; but she also said that she had already separated herself emotionally from him and insisted only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked the back door for him, Joseph bears with dignity so far.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, it doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the plot, I make the purchases."
"I talk to Darina quite normally, only we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep with each other, so I don’t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I know it’s my fault, I’ve fallen in love with Iveta and that’s why I take all responsibility.
The Worst Female Virtues: How Are They?
If you ask the men to name some typical female virtues, then they will shake some without exception promptly out of their sleeves.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we pass a few unseated reviews again, which allow the men to shed the blood in the veins?
Shopping addiction
Is your husband accusing them of being shopping addicts?
Do you have to buy at least one fight a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can there be a bit more in promotions as well?
In your case, it is really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping cravings halfway under control.
But hand to heart, what woman can stand to wander through a clothing store in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not just try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times she's told her husband - you better stay out...
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I should lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or gymnastics?"
“Do you like me at all?”
Does that seem familiar to you somehow?
Yeah? Yeah.
Then you may also be among the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men react allergicly to it if their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerable.
Order and cleanliness first
It is a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust that shave the tub – and this at least twice a week.
Do you scold your partner for stepping on the clean tiles again with dirty shoes, did you scold the children because the just shaved sink is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room closet has fingerprints again, but where does polishing make so much trouble?
If you suffer from this type of "deviance", then you should know that you should not exaggerate anything and order and cleanliness in family life do not come first.
This immeasurable sense of purity can ultimately also harm mutual relationships and, above all, the tranquillity of the family.
Sticheln
"Dirty turnip pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, do not be surprised that it will bring him to the palm.
Of course, this is not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to mock so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clapping and chatter, because behind their backs they are slandered or even slandered or alliances are forged.
Women are now sometimes focused on relationships, so they like to sneak through such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a little harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hands on heart - this is probably the case for all women.
But this is not to be confused with gossiping rude calibers, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and who pose a significant danger, especially to women’s collectives.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped Philadelphia win with their assists
Ice hockey striker Jaromír Jágr played a big part in Philadelphia’s 5:3 victory on the ice in Carolina with two assists at Monday’s NHL game, making him once again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assist and was named the best player of the match.
Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the same game.
After the game, Jagr claimed to reporters that he had prophesied a great evening for Giroux.
"Before the game, I'm telling him he's got a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that.”
"Sometimes it feels like that," said Jágr, after which Giroux scored a goal on the first shot of the flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had a "Czech track".
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek took the puck behind the hurricane gate and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first-third kick-off, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second-third belonged to the flyers again.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but I’m sure he’s one of the top three,” Jágr said.
"I would not have thought in my life that at the end of my career I would be playing with such an ice hockey player as he is."
"I'm so happy."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates set their game on me and now the crap is turning around," Jágr said.
Carolina made the game even more dramatic - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who made it through from a penalty shot, came close to a goal.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complications in which he was successful in overnumber two against one.
"Excellently acted Pronger still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the forefront of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender from Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an injury on the upper body.
The Candiens, besides their experienced Beck, also fined their lead an undefeated in Penalty shooting 2:3.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec could not turn one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defending players to finish.
"That's bad."
"We ended the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to do about it," said Jacques Martin.
"With each change, one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to oppose it."
"We should have made the game easier and put the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here,” said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay, thus contributing decisively to the 5:2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which thus ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five licensed state travel agencies in the then <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time mainly sold only travel to the socialist eastern bloc countries, in the West at that time only the chosen ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even the citizens of the Eastern Bloc (including the Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered travel to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This was not the case for a long time.
The so-called currency pledge - the condition for an exit to the West - was given only to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange pledge.
Therefore, the vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in the countryside, it is no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and cottages - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, of which one is not even aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the obligation to exchange currencies in neighbouring Western European countries has been lifted, resulting in a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
When traveling to Paris, Czech travelers slept in the tent in the park, because who would have had the money for accommodation in a hotel or pension at the time.
A typical feature of Czech foreign trips at the time was a suitcase full of canned food, beer and permanent sausages, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus also our average wages increased, leading to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare for charter flights after 1997, which made air travel incredibly cheaper than in the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already had currencyless payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-satin" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was made - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech passengers have flown annually to distant sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flown directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our “post-revolutionary” development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitively one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per person for a single holiday stay including the cost of the resort.
The general meeting is supposed to find a new chairman - again a patch threatens.
For almost five months, the Czech football has no chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is still no agreement on which electoral procedure to be followed.
Without this, no vote on the three potential successors will be possible.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his position, urging his colleagues to come to an agreement and find a strong personality who could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old quarrels between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This became clear and clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the House of Commons in the Smíchov district of Prague in vain, because the negotiation did not lead to any result and it was not only about the election itself.
In fact, it was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote at the plenary session - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
On this single point, agreement was reached at least in part, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion is that representation on a proxy basis is not appropriate.
Disputes over the electoral system, however, continue.
The Executive Committee also did not bring any clarity to the matter, in principle, at its meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Although the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a patch situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statute or whether to find a completely different model," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the largest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is reportedly ready to compromise that the candidate who receives the highest number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moorish side, who would prefer not to bend the electoral rules, but to vote according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also agrees with this, although it is noted that the statutory electoral rules are most likely to come against Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is to be elected as much as possible according to the statutes."
"So that no nonsensical alternatives are devised, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who for the first time nominated and in his statements detached himself mainly from Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will continue to work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the World Cup today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater", says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three fans, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more cautious.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to 'correct' the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a re-blocking at the General Assembly is not excluded."
"But I hope that common sense will ultimately win," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is not left.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the generality of football until the qualifying game will be complete at all.
The charter plane, with which, among others, Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not even start in Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and so they were feverishly looking for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage-himplay.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, will be crucial.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government subsidies, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the forthcoming General Assembly of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which is to guide Czech sport in the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the Extraordinary General Assembly could have been a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have entered the fight for this top position at all.
“If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election.”
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Ordinary General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I have personally spoken to some of the people in question."
“I can’t believe some people told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbs Pelta's connection with the president of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is regarded behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík to have Pelta as chairman.
"With his victory, today's condition would be preserved and in Czech football it would not progress at all."
"The support from Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," Paclík said.
He also claims that Pelta’s name fell some time ago in connection with phone interviews for investigation in a corruption case, but Pelta emerged from it with impunity.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who said in his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but already sees something more relaxed.
Should Paclík win the Thursday election, however, he could imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the general meeting in October, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great abilities".
"I could imagine him, for example, as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's capable of leading the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September had provided for surveillance that he was behind the dismissal of the arbitration commission with Lu<0xC4><0x91><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela at the head, replacing Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels grown the role of the president of the association.
Invoking his skills in the management of private companies, he has also been the head of Pilsen since last summer, which with his support celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"To limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and vocational commissions, which even evolves into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy to Sparta chief Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etínsk<0xC3><0xBD>, for example.
As one of his priorities, he saw the consolidation of relations between FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the top politicians for more money from the lottery tax to flow into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should be dedicated to."
“When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their arguments, but they also have to say cleverly and clearly where the money is going,” he said.
His connection to the Pilsner club also does not see Paclík as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "bipartite".
Pelta in turn is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
“That’s not exactly ideal.”
"But I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club hypocritically to a third person to return after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would exclude a patch situation in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Federation, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he were elected, he would make a strong commitment that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would get new statutes that would rule out disputes about the electoral rules in the future from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday’s Nymburk hearing and believes that the election campaign will surely defuse if the Czech election is successful.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the raising of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, so he liked the two-month break to help him defend his ideas about the management of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone," said the man, who is mainly affiliated with the Jablonecer club, who also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
That is why he believes that he has sufficient experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the election are caused by the euphoria that reigned in the days of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the General Assembly in June, which were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September onwards,” Pelta said.
It was the revision of the most important document of the civic association that he used as a lure for delegates.
“If I’m going to be president, I’m going to take that personally and I’m willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work.”
“This is a principled thing without which he cannot be,” Pelta says.
In addition, he does not try to distinguish himself from his counterparts.
Earlier, he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education, and he knows well that his counter-candidate would be his first deputy.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík did not attack for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to some successes."
"But his attacks were demeaning and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many are now doubting his true character," Pelta said to his counterpart, who is likely to remain true to his proclamations he made in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
“I would also try to end all affairs – from the Bohemian cause to the aftermath of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Immediately after that, I would rush into negotiations with the private and public sectors to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personal cleansing.
"I should first get acquainted with the work content of all the employees," he said towards Strahov, where there is a sense of nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the forthcoming General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk on Thursday in vain.
"If it really is the only point of contention as to how to vote in the third round, then we'll get over it."
“Football needs credibility, and he will only win it back when he finally has a new leader,” Pelta said in a statement.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If the former vice-chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were to be elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday, this would allegedly make many people in the association feel at ease.
Rajchl promises that if he chooses, he will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and hold the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has begun.
"As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to youth performance football."
"I don't mean to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competencies on the executive committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute tough tasks so that the football advances with milestones in each segment."
Many would not be delighted with this, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered not to run at all.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don’t tirelessly throw buds between my legs and question every step I take,” he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"But a lot of people told me that I shouldn't give up because other people would."
“It’s a trust that you can’t lose,” he said.
It is also said to motivate him to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years, we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to just throw that away.”
"Processes have been launched, which will probably only come into effect in a few years, and I would not like to see them stop," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - was elected, the situation could return to the days before Hashek.
“I believe in systematic action and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
“He’s got people behind him who would make football so that he’d only be there for the chosen ones.”
I may be accused of something, but not of being partisan."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is doing well and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
“Even if some people say otherwise, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then each ascend to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Now that the head of the Pilsner club Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík has joined the fight for the office of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also said the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement renegotiating his television contracts and these.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the beginning to help re-create confidence in Czech football", he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated and also the staffing in the commissions he obviously would not fundamentally change."
He certainly wouldn’t want to bend things in his favor,” Rajchl says about his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jumping into the blue
By Julia Stanek
UFO-look plank pools, splendid pools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, the tired legs rest in splash baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past year and a half, one thing could not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Leaning back on the water, she looked up at artfully designed domes, swam in front of marble pots waiting for her at the edge of the basin, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it in flight into her notebook - with informative details about the construction and history of the building.
Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and presents them in her newly published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore-Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her “travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe”: besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland – and each one a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports, she doesn't have much to do, says Meder - only in the water, it's different.
Annoying just that swimmers have to settle down with blue tiles and chlorine smell, while joggers can inhale the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird whispering in the park.
“I wondered one day why swimming pools have to be so ugly,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubles the architecture
Plaster in the spring pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming halls can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture tape "Badefreuden" conveys on 190 pages interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all, it makes a desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a ury karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building Jáürszárszéber (in Jáürszál).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you can keep an eye on the whole city from the Zurich rooftop bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: in the steam bath there is a window from which you can drift on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a Ufo landed right in the Alps.
From three upwards open shells, it vaporizes in winter, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal protrude into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every pool did the pool collector Meder get the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so strongly of heating oil that you hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and its slickness sticks to the skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pelvis - a special wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a locked-down terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902, has since been closed.
As Meder looked through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weed growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, you have counteracted the decay in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath already has three phases behind it; you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originated from the Black Forest.
"It's already an achievement to merge so different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only an incident.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine through
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For federal citizens, the point is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions step out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that wagers on global commodity exchanges are driving prices upwards – and banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign specifically targets Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity betting was intended to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that sugars have decoupled themselves from supply and demand – and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "worthy of putting the Deutsche Bank's good reputation at stake".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is due to be completed by the end of the year and the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - including recommendations on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will then announce what consequences it will have.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade, or even the complete withdrawal.
Ackermann builds on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: “The bet on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are harming the public good today.”
Ackermann is now a top banking lobbyist especially in duty.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or with the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that, unlike planned, the CEO will not switch to the Supervisory Board.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order for possible losses, he hardly needs to shave - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
One in two people would cancel their raw material facilities.
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only eleven percent believe that Deutsche Bank offers investments that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would, according to the survey, terminate all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43% of respondents said they would withdraw from such a bank, 49% said they would consider terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
Von Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and happy ends: the Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and bare.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussel World Exhibition is a striking and famous example.
Schwanzer’s pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian Pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like auxiliary construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Wiener Südbahnhof and rebuilt and opened in 1962 in it a museum of the 20th century - the "20th house" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art got a new home in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a case of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a considerable career in youth as an ice skating runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, firmly established the renovation with politicians and monument protectors.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small state
For the implementation, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he sensibly rebuilt and expanded Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was a "hugely important place" for him, where he had "almost every weekend" looked at the exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and reused.
There were far greater problems with the current renovation: the building was “an energy smuggler,” says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, insulated glass reinforced with fiberglass and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel supports have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light pit between the house and the street provides exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the lightweight tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust-proof paint.
And the cinema room is still exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small staff.
"Often we had to find a material that is good and cheap and also liked the monumental protection," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rugged floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to awaken a real awareness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because an urban accident has occurred: around the Swiss garden, the completely redesigned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential houses, is being created.
And another chance will perhaps come: the 21st House could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighborhood location in the Swiss garden.
Bahn plans winter crisis package at a millionth level
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train crashes in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance, citing a group-internal crisis plan, that investments of a total of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This will improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snow removal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people.
The goal is to free railway platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours of starting operations and 90 percent of the necessary operating paths.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned against train crashes and delays this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger traffic, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For years, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railways Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been making it necessary for years to have axes of ICE trains checked significantly more often in the workshop after an ICE at Cologne Hauptbahnhof had an axle breakdown.
Deutsche Bank to pay millions in the US
After the turmoil over Chief Josef Ackermann, a new outrage comes from the United States: the Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems at home weren’t enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now recognising its past in the US: The Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the collapse of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost value during the financial crisis and plunged the banks into the depths.
“We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court,” said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not admit any debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the meeting of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and leaps into bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to compensate for the billion-dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also pre-buttoned other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
This is based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a destiny for a multitude of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though the events have been going on for several years, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to seek reparation or to allege wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest lawsuit.
It accuses 18 major international banks of overtaking two U.S. state real estate funders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage deals worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit from the FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand for "substantial losses", without mentioning an exact amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unstoppable and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett to raise $10 billion at IBM
Finance guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the companies can only be poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, the IBM IT hub can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed on CNBC that he has purchased $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Berkshire Hathaway is one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM knew anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had provided decent profits.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as data center operations for quite some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology firms to date.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached, for example, a freight railroad, a lubricant manufacturer or a machine builder.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries and shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had acquired the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of the Buffett investment, the IBM stock rose by one percent in advance of the stock market.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion in the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he did not want to join.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media have doubts about the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a far-right background.
This news is being reacted to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, a long-deadly ghost is returning: since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks against a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never questioned.
However, the exposed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" headlined the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted judiciously: it recalled the victims of racist violence with a memorial guard outside the Brandenburg Gate at the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in an act of celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It had been staged in cheerful colors – as a story of success.
The news of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
“It’s starting to stink,” says the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, that they had paid taxes and that their work had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the police’s actions and their subsequent search success are discussed extremely critically.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some are at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: "If the migrants continue to be trapped here, nothing remains but self-defense and armament."
"This will probably be the best self-protection".
"The goodness of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depend very strongly on the internal peace in Germany", writes "Selen".
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger is illustrated by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the attacks exacerbated the US sentiment on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, the failure of German politics after the attacks was mainly criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Molln.
After the Solingen fire, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech how many taxes the local Turks paid.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxation.
The current coverage of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been ever since.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive clarification and reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is located not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge it.
Axel Weber certainly didn’t think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grossbank UBS – an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity, and dropped friendly comments about future colleagues.
"The UBS has managed the turnaround".
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS dealer in London had circumvented all of the bank’s hedge systems and stolen about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of directors of UBS has since also been considered defeated - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he takes over the chairmanship of the Board of Directors already in May - not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is going to be hard.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and a banker, and certainly would have needed a rehabilitation period.
With one blow, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just once again proved that it has long earned the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank".
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She combined the image of a secretive and solid, but also elaborate Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a very big number in investment banking as well.
In 2007, UBS managed more money for wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it was advanced as an investment bank into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, says: "I always set UBS as a model for a good bank to my students at the time."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How could I be so wrong?"
He made a huge mistake.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, he was wondering why he had left.
The bank’s investment department had been screwed with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of sage and writes in 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors for this, but ones that some people would have been upset until recently: an opaque Asian government fund from Singapore and an Arab government fund that was so secret that you didn’t even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of dollars in losses, and CEO Marcel Ospel, Switzerland’s second-best-paid board of directors, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS, in the face of its poor investments in the financial crisis, was in danger of collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bond, through which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken – for it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to host such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS in 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again, we couldn't save UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to release the data of wealthy customers who may have been collecting taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million – as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty.
Thus, UBS was more or less openly known to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both key areas of business: in investment banking through misspelling and in asset management through tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought UBS would get it back, then follows this unhappy trader story: A single trader fucks up 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes something is going wrong.
And it turns out: with risk management in investment banking, it obviously still doesn’t work.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: “The problem with UBS is that it has no control over risk control.”
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago set out to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - even if the world collapsed beyond the Alpine Republic.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of the wealthy Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
Already the location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich Railway Road, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse, to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is accessed by a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bench logo a large sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has been suppressed by both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point – or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does business, like all Swiss bankers, also with the two major banks.
The UBS has become much too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if so, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first yielding high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss grand bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million-country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were approved by the politicians to save the bankruptcy of the large bank.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss major banks merged into a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and was growing.
The two different predecessors banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but dormant bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money, with which they could spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, humble, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked his way up from banking to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: arrogance came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: “Goldman Sachs gets off the throne.”
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That’s where UBS wanted to go, all the way up.
Some of her steps were already successful.
She played a leading role in foreign exchange and stock trading.
However, company consultants who were commissioned pointed out a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost them existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities on to American mortgage loans – but also held risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” says bank expert Geiger.
So great is the euphoria, so deep is the case.
One manager after the other had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a sliding seat and are shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the underlying business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: an end to investment banking, a focus on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: he is supposed to permanently manage the business of UBS, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to return to the status quo in the mid-1990s.
3500 posts he deletes.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money from?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask himself right now.
So far, he has only said that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year's.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock exchanges
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of U.S. investors to take a weekly nap.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The throttled industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in germs.
The general relief from the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were again pushing into the foreground, said Janney Montgomery Scott's Mark Luschini.
In particular, financial values were on the sales sheets.

Europe will not be able to get out of a recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
This is why it is too early to invest in European sovereign bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the heap and entered the U.S. tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the company’s traditional stock price and made it nearly 1% higher against the trend in the course of trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

Smart Crows Spread in Cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities residents complain about the dirt and noise of animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer to be taken out of the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian emptiness.
There, experts from all over the federal territory advised on possible exits.
You are looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the land flight of the specially protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroyed the traditional habitats.
Hunting, growing crops and falling typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are found, among others, in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project on the mass killing of crows in the county had created negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of animals in bird traps and the killing with buds as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the crimping, does not bring anything," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found out of nowhere.
Nesting nests with water or falling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals fade away, large colonies split up and spread to other places."
Agglomeration is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surroundings, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable a combination of grazing the animals from sensitive living areas and lure offers to resettle them in other places.
"Info boards instead of chainsaws" on the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens warns for a completely different handling of the animals: "A pimple in the face can be best tolerated in the end with self-confidence."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Asheberg Crow Training Path, where signposts inform about the life of highly intelligent seed cranes.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but even make their own tool as an aid.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to bring a scaffold to the collapse in order to get to a moth larvae.
Without a lot of training, they realized purposefully what size and shape a stone must have in order for the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the crows had to solve a more complicated problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had wired them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle of the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded in this at first.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at 2012 World Cup
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained unfulfilled.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have settled the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive World Cup entry perfect after the 0-0 draw.
The Czechs had a 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off draw against outsider Montenegro, after the match (2-0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia also lost 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the next hits for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa against Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters to the early lead in the masts.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed his wide-shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goaltender Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English table leader Manchester City put a header at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trading meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who Misimovic safely transformed.
However, after the break, the 2004 vice-champion made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek finished the last doubt in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time that the European Champion has competed in the European Championship since 1976.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a terrifying second in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turn from the penalty area just past the goal of Cech.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally made everything clear.
In the meantime, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink will almost certainly have to clear his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan hit only the pole with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to sink the kicker into the goal.
However, after the second of terror, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made way for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni drives to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish held their first European Championship in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute with the 4–0 success in the hindsight.
Konstantin Vasiliev (57th) equalized for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from start to finish, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane had his first good chance.
Only at the last minute did the Estonian back team prevent the possible lead hit.
In the 32nd minute, that was it.
After an unsuccessful defense by Cloussmann Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball 1:0 over the line.

SAP aims to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and aims to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately $2 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 billion) is expected to flow, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire staff accordingly,” Co-Chef Bill McDermott announced at a customer show in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of offices of the world market leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are based in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, runs as rarely as before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Empathetic and generous, Peter Englund’s new book Beauty and Horrors: A World War I Story, told in nineteen destinies begins with a long list of main characters that goes to one’s heart.
Here’s a tip on how to do it: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund’s romantic narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a beacon in these few moments when you, like Englund’s men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he does not inaccurately describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, angry reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Horror" is almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war combined, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Each of these lives flickers like the votive candles in a church, some are added while others are extinguished.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Horror" wanders with expert views over other places of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsets flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance. Stay or take the escape?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Lacking facts," Englund notes, "were furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or gripping, but they are extremely vivid in the englunds of the collection of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them are in need of help and support.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake eraser rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He talks more about food substitutes in Germany.
He describes "meat made from squeezed rice and baked in hamel grease (and last served with a fake wooden bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes lined with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the making of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says about the war: "One feels that this is, after all, what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and doing so as if it meant such a facade of civilization and bare-being."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will notice or take care of it.
“When you give up the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it’s as terrible as “a convicted man who was hanged in secret.”
Other observations deal with the old Europe falling apart, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Englund, “a war between the factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word-wise and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a suit of measure who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
Humans behave in unforeseen ways and there are just as frivolous behaviors as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get infected with a sex-disease prostitute in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade in gonococcus yeast, because soldiers bought and lubricated their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, causing them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry is smooth and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly falsified, such as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West Nothing New" rather than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a fact book.
I'm not giving it away anymore.
But it’s as if he’d snatched us this page with the main characters in front of his nose with his book and lit it with a firewood.
After an early miscarriage a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing operational helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday had been chosen because at that time there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the decree and gave the occupants of the house a huge increase in public sympathies, could not be repeated.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up so-called chaos training — counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came “at the last minute,” someone familiar with the orders said, speaking of a declaration as an “exercise.”
“The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, didn’t know it was about Zuccotti Park,” someone who wants to remain anonymous said.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters gathered after they learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including deployment commandos from across the city - hundreds of mobile officials, who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 o’clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the smallest number of people stayed in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before the descent at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages sounding from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply picked up their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the vicinity to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said it was for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to prevent them from watching the police operations in the park, and they said that the officials' handling was very harsh.
Mr Browne said television cars could have taken pictures on Church Street on the west side of the park.
As the police moved westwards through the big mess of the protesters’ personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags of clothes, the city’s cleaning staff followed them, picking up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, and pictures of them appeared on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A main core of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some barriers were erected and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were tied to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Disaster protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to police.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, he said, because of “unburdened behavior and resistance to arrest.”
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Criminal Officers Department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "didn't lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials was waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block further south.
It was possible to observe how from these locations the police expanded the circumference around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with shields, were seen driving people out.
About 28 people were in the northern vicinity.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an officer and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of caregivers will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school attendants who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid employees and lost their jobs in a chess move on 7 October should have described the trade union leader as political revenge for having robbed the city of access to a health fund last year.
These allegations have been categorically denied by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said redundancies were part of the budget that was approved in June.
A member of the city council fired back and told him that the budget did not specify that school aid workers would be fired.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a lawsuit, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference formally announcing the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the City’s Department of Education as defendants, and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Justice Department, said the city did not file the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on their individual allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit submitted to the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city’s poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit over inequality, claiming that poor schools lost more helpers because they were chronically underfunded.
She explains that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 attendants were redundant in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Determining the loss of five out of eight school attendants who were employed at Harlem Public School 36, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: “This is not a neighborhood of beleaguered parents who can organize donations to catch up on budget cuts.”
P.S.: The budget for the 36th district was cut by 3.26% this year. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, although "excess" in the U.S. usually describes changing a teacher's salary from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," the complaint draft states.
Mission ends, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already making a deal about the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on International Relations will adopt a resolution that will be submitted to President John Kerry (Massachusetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "mute."
“This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House were arguing over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the US military in NATO’s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties and there was no vote.
However, on the same day, the bill passed in the Senate, and the House passed a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission fell into a sort of legislative sweep – with a congress angry enough to criticize Obama’s actions as part of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell to the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they split the legislators, as the June Act did?
The last version encounters the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every Republican and some Democrat congressional legislature.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently being voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their amendments to a vote, although they have tried it enough often.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress, covering a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both Congress and the Senate - others only slightly diverge from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget amendment and another dozen that would "control federal spending" in the Senate alone.
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients – especially beginners with Republicans who want to polish their resumes – the opportunity to boast that they have “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a budget balance change.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits same-sex marriage is a recurring one, as is a change that prohibits burning flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eagerly as the Members propose changes, so unequally they move faster than in previous years.
In the 111st Congress, lawmakers submitted 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Hit, but not defeated," says Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man shot her at close range during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday evening singing on her own to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said to get back in greater than the wish.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she rang for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain, and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her voice for the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang – describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gifford, 41, replied, "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour “20/20” special recorded shortly before the couple’s new book was released: “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special follows Gifford’s recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see her in the hospital bed, with her head shaved bare and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod to the head.
A squeeze with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: You see the congresswoman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'."
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she could not remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he read Giffords a newspaper article about the attack on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forced to undergo medical treatment while waiting for his trial.
“Many people have died,” said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
“So, I would say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t defeated?’” Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you will pass that and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxes stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then-Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really it wasn't, it was pity.
The sharply contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the mostly distanced, sometimes admired, American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly behaving as if you were hurting people in uniform.
"We were not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq, said in a statement.
“But apparently the only way to support us is to push us into the role of unhappy souls.”
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that struck the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, there are conversations about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would regard them with a sense of reverence as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "angry, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and assumed a senior state post in Washington upon his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents were subtly asking if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian told his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely customary in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces increasing pressure to take tough action on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-interference in a rape case before the military court.
Should this not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who was carrying a 12 pack of beer.
He asked if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went off," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman washed away her worries.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
“I wish I had listened to my stomach.”
A few minutes after they went to Lyman’s room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down, and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether a lawsuit they filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not act against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially encompassed 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to take part in a lawsuit, failing to seek redress.
Burke says she's chasing the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchically structured,” she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by Attorney General Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court’s files, which are available to Newsweek, outline the defense strategy in detail, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries it has suffered in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 law of the Supreme Court, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damages occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document states.
The Department of Defense denies any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to service in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 women soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time to modernize the military, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other lawsuits besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a feminine atmosphere.
Independently of this, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received in order to fire them from service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Human Rights Network.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration (Veterans Administration) in which it accused its discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for people who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, providing a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Ministry of Defense, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur per year.
The report, published in March, also investigates law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of recorded cases in the military were brought to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the assault.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a number of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a set of rapes and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during which she was asked about the sex she had before the assault with her boyfriend.
Six people spoke as characters on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I still remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought the weeping would take place. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was dishonestly dismissed, so she received no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs is proceeding is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Still, he notes, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I have been a critic of the Feres Doctrine for a long time.
The military is a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that liability entails.
He adds, “The chances are against her...but it’s important for them that they try.”
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the plaintiff’s attorney, will start with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there are reforms,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to having committed an ambush in Norway in July that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time up to his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That’s easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found it wasn’t difficult to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the site’s advertising tool to accurately pinpoint their desired demographics with scientific accuracy — as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing fan groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the adds invited users to a survey asking about their educational status, their attitude to violence, and their assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their office once.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online promoters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more sensible, more democratic, and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends such as likes, text messages, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, Facebook’s data supernova is generating a research boom that has seen the number of scientific papers named after this page in the title rise by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this site you can study people that you usually don’t reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to interview people of the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
“They had to inform the party first and it would never have given them access,” Bartlett says.
“With Facebook, all that goes away – you go straight to them.”
Others say that the site provides an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-length on Facebook were significantly more likely to have problems with drinking than students who were silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that peer-to-peer students, such as residential counselors, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly collecting the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using data only Facebook has access to – digital freedom champions have long known that the site should make its big data pit accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to share their own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research has to take care of the social – and a lot of social life is still taking place offline.”
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two shootings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Templar of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who delivered a pre-written speech, the permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered Breivik to remain in police custody for another 12 weeks, saying he would not have access to the media for four weeks and that authorities would monitor all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in hopes of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he would stay behind bars and locks.
All of them took part with the goal that everything would go to an end.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a little further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre remark that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may seem to some that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the sadness and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," the victim's relative said.
“It would be so much easier if he did.”
7 Lessons from the Interview with the Deceased Steve Jobs Showed at a Theatre This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans may find most revealing, though, in the recently rediscovered job interview that dusted off this week ahead of special film screenings in key markets is how much this creative mind has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who eagerly crafted diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffer from "a disease of thinking" "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work a great one.
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Idiots" about the breakup of the personal computer. And he sat for more than an hour with jobs in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By that time, it had been 10 years since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley’s interview was used in faci idiots, he says the interview’s copy templates were missing at the delivery.
It was only after Job’s death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which is coming to the Landmark Theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to issues or incidents of greater importance.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the lost interview seems somewhat eeriely far-sighted when Jobs assesses what other companies think is right or wrong and presents its own vision for the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous appreciations of Jobs' career, but seeing Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the leap to greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he moved on and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask, 'Why are you doing things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's done.'
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed at how costs were recorded – most of them started with “standard costs” that were quantified on mere assumptions and then adjusted with “deviation” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest.
As the pope said:
Jobs talks about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could sneak into the telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
A lot has been written about the device, but Job’s enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things half a dozen times around the world and if you buzzed the phone, it came out again a minute later on the phone next door,” Jobs says, laughing.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both, we didn’t know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to talk about a glorious stroke that Wozniak and he nearly pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the pope while they imitated Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovations:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he was installing some circuit boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment term of only 30 days and had to consider both assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had with developing a computer mouse:
“I remember punching arguments...They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About big companies that are down:
Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs anticipated the ways in which so many industry giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or printer, well?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it’s such people] who ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if it had been the Microsoft of the 1990s.
You have captured the defeat from the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things that you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it goes out to the taste, it goes out to try to deal with the best things that humans have created and then try to bring those things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been for the computer industry, they would have done fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas Dine With Opponents of Health Laws as Court Admits Case
On the day the Supreme Court assembled behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the lawsuit.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has become a staple among conservative activists across the U.S.
In fact, a five-and-a-half-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to boost the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be tilted will likely be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, an old-fashioned group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which is challenging the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially hugely involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case, in a Washington hotel.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republicans’ party leader and an outspoken opponent of health care reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges free themselves from the code of conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend charitable events close to the law and other organizations, where the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or guest of such events according to the program."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms involved in the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, were enough to alarm moral and government activists.
“This astonishing breach of morality and the contradiction to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges by lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinned during a benefit event with lawyers with floating proceedings in court."
Their performance and support for a donation campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the Attorney General under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits were brought before the courts.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing for bias, as she was too committed to defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan does not make any arrangements to do so.
Boeing to land record $18 trillion order
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-engine aircraft with an option on 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is the customer of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest ever order for commercial aircraft over the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 twin Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show in 2011, an option on the purchase of 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, then ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a Morningstar stock exchange trader.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which is usually harmful to airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so damaging, as the country earns a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to be less likely than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
The Emirates order confirms Boeing’s leadership in the large-scale aircraft market and helps to keep Airbus competitor SAS in check, which is attacking the dominance position with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, directly competing with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Loses Election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governorship.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for the governorship in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the entire country," Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... They occupied election booths, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely beaten Claderon, who had led the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother’s conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, who is still serving as governor, came in third place, a severe defeat for the divided and unfortunate left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital Morelia, denies connections to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have resigned out of fear of the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan seem.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look boldly into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) who look “passionately” at the difficulties in Europe, saying that financial support to European leadership and European resources through Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some degree, but it is not immune.”
“If China and India can help, then by all means.”
Europe’s monetary union has been hit by a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest rates have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe fuels fears that the global economy may collapse into recession and has led to calls for the leading emerging markets to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) – would offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from falling exports and drying out foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help the wealthy Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to the 1.2 trillion people in India, more than 800 million of whom live on $2 or even less a day.
"Sometimes they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greece’s numerous and well-paid employees in the public service, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railroad.
Mr Nag said the crises in the eurozone will have “significant domino effects” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast of 7.5 percent growth in Asia for 2011/2011 now threatens “the risk of degradation” due to the imminent threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnoticedly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and civilian ribbons.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress is unable to complete spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% overall cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such an reckless manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects unworkable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to safely allow civilians to achieve the goal."
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who sustain our military and seriously damage our alertness.”
The cuts were ultimately hitting the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the war-time contingents in the anti-terrorism struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been cut, which would lead to delays in the settings and the hiring supervision that supports the war."
"Personnel salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime merchants, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for further details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon, when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is a result that we can’t live with, and it’s certainly not something that should be imposed on us.”
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to enter."
Whether Panetta’s letter and the Senators’ new warnings will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly voiced the possible cuts, though he has been able to accumulate many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a grim picture of what might be coming – a military with a shell but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
“It’s a fighting force that lacks morality and alertness and is unable to take it up with potential opponents.”
"She makes you really angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details on how reductions “create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious limitations of our global engagement and intervention capability, leading to an unacceptable risk in future warfare.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects of the deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stages.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but advocates say it’s an important next step in upgrading so that potential dangers can be banished by China and other adversaries.
How to unmask a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is obsessed with the accusations of sexual harassment by several women, and both sides accuse each other of lying.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of mistreatment for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy claimed to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies are destroying careers and shaking countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool out of himself when he put denials into circulation that were very quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violating campaign funding in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about swings at school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents where teachers have given their students the exam answers so that they are well-suited to their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and swinging are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies have shown that we lie 10 to 200 times a day.
However, many of these lies are seen as emergencies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or “discovering lies” is one that is important to learn for every person, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as charades, in which the goal is to call out "Have You!", the unmasking of deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades from respected universities, in particular, the field of physiology and the far-reaching research projects in which Physiology, Physiology, and Physiology are involved.
One result of the research is that most of the ancient myths about lying have been unmasked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don’t always snore, stumble, blush, and tingle.
However, we cannot conclude from this that these liars are difficult to detect and unmask.
A trained liar can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the assertion, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of disguise. And it is clear that disguising a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to cope in our complex world, especially when advising or questioning individuals or negotiating on their own.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions. And they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people that men are more likely to list “self-centered” lies than women whose lies are more “orientated to others” – as a rule, they want to protect the feelings of others – that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people.
We also know that when a person has been exposed as a criminal, others feel less guilty of having lied to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of that person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent assessment of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone is usually constantly tripping with their foot so that they don’t unfairly accuse them of tripping with their foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells screaming, not evidence of disguise.
People who lie may become stiff when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the hiring interview", this deep, relaxing exhalations when they are all in question, the change of harness.
Questioners often mistakenly signal that a job interview is over, just to keep an eye out for that relaxation after the job interview.
Also, pay attention to your test person’s language.
Scott Peterson’s slider is famous when he used the form of the past when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a distanced language: "I did not have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or when repeating a tricky question altogether.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use “qualifying language” when answering a tricky question: “Well...to tell you the truth...as far as I know...to the best of my knowledge and conscience.”
As a result, the response becomes more perceptive than factual, as a result of which the alarm bells often ring.
There is no magical way to disguise lies, but you can learn the skills that make it possible to disguise them.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become a victim of fraud less often, both in private and professional life.
A controversial oil pipeline plan is being revised after being threatened by delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, annoying unions and at the same time reassuring environmentalists, that is what the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that you can return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it would reroute the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska parliament building.
TransCanada’s Alex Pourbax said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week that it would postpone a decision on a federal approval for the project until the new possible course was reviewed, which would avoid the Sandhills area in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala aquifer, a major underwater supply.
“This is a real step forward,” Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the State Department and expressed his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was to connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska’s lawmakers who oppose the plan are weighing the laws to enforce a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the Department’s chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process that focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s adviser in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged for allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle had a stroke in the lobby of her Manhattan building, which would have frightened her little daughter so much that she surrendered to fear.
The tirade of "Lady Marmalade" singer made 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year that stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk went into the lobby of her Riverside Boulevard building with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman furiously.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t drop your daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started slandering - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started leaning water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed to the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her escort and pulled into a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that he had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he does not charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they receive to child cancer care.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is exposed to a kindergartener carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate change has slowed the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez’s rule, unemployment and black labor rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and aroused great hopes regarding economic growth, is on the government. However, due to the climatic adversities, the indicator of growth may not be important.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also placed close limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical degradation of agricultural development by 31.16 percent.
According to a report published by the Mexican Council for Rural Development Sustainable, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed, all of which were affected by the frost.
The decline in economic activity up to November has led to a continuous increase in unemployment in the first percent of people in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which is 4,53 percent of the working population in September.
Less liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. Economics scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), commented that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is a rise in unemployment, which is explained by several factors. Among other things, liquidity losses in the market as a result of the funds cuts by the legislation passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are forbidden to invest something, it is easy to accumulate dollars for them," he said.
Immigration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is on the one hand due to immigration problems and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Black labor
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high share of black labour, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of the country’s employees who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and black labor are the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social and the Secretaria del Trabajo y Previsión Social.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos as of September, which is much less than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decreased ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and growing unemployment, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to the Secretariat of Economics, the ADI amounted to $ 630 597 from January to June, which is a decrease of $ 87.74 percent in the period 3 years in comparison with 5 years.
The Secretaria de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Secretaria de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno) in turn has a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debts
In the face of the economic crisis, the state government applied for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos at the National Congress in July to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in order to reactivate the economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, Mario López Valdés’ first year of government made government incapacity obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Mexico’s national chamber of manufacturing), said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country’s economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the main impacts is a slow economy that is not moving enough to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services", therefore, we will conclude the year below.
Redefining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, said that the state should be encouraged to engage in more productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and lineage of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There is a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will drive the government’s efforts into better tracks.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident has been sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The state prosecutor's office said the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a crime against public health - here the commercial possession of marijuana.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican military during the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez Street opposite the guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack on the passenger seat in which the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the punished person remains in the execution facility.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided in the Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programs run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda.
The head of the Urban Social Development Authority explained that, although the construction programs have already advanced, they are now in jeopardy, as the state government has not paid the funds due to it, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far, only the Federation and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, so a delay in the completion of the construction was to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and even though they should have paid us a share in July," he said. "To not be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had failed to meet its commitments, so the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of his reign, which corresponded to the amount that the central government should have paid.
"This had happened to us in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not put in to participate in these programs," he said.
Even though the state authorities are obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, , was asked to speed up the administrative work and pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny."
The court approves for 2015 the transition to digital television in Mexico
The transition from analog to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and under which the switch from analogue to digital signals must be postponed from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the decree-law detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected because it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes to allow the court to decide on constitutionality or unconstitutionality, thus the law remains in force.
In the draft lawsuit drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Decree-Law unconstitutional, as the Commission Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the regulations relating to radio and television.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Decree-Law. After the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree-Law and stopped all activities for the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without taking part in the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the national government should not regulate the measures that the public administration should take with general regulations.
She also recalled that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it manages the affairs of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest that has not only technical aspects, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and security-technical aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required the action of the entire system, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a set of features that put the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation through the government, even though they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government interferes in the competences of Congress with the issuance of the contested legislative decree, because the laws adopted by the legislature would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting ballot papers in Michoacán individually is considered
According to Prep, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
The possibility of single counting of ballots is a reality in the Michoacán elections this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminarios (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just on November 9 the polling station had adopted a number of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution or his electoral law or his law on electoral justice to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they had not come into force in this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the day of the state referendum, with the exception of the Free State.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional lawsuit filed by the local legislature and judged the vote of the state commissioner on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful" because he does not have the right to "decide or veto it".
María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of individual counting of votes that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballots partially or completely.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted. The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not documented or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of fully completed ballots may be counted if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the second-placed candidate, which is equal to or less than one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second-placed candidate.
The total number of votes may also be counted if, after the completion of the ordinary calculation, it is found that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an express request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become a second party.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second places is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés landed this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace, on Monday, the show of the dead and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant-colonel was that his ashes should be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others who died in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a Mexican Air Force plane, which took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the Colonel’s ashes landed on the mourning hall on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family members and friends arrived.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, and this body-show was organized by his former high school classmates and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparations for high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant-colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would make him dizzy even on a truck, yet he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good man. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family already wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
One last farewell
The lieutenant-colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honors under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honor was bestowed upon him by the people and the government, both the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force and the head of the school as head of education and education in 1985.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority were seated, crashed.
At 6.05 p.m., the remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over in the forecourt of the barracks by the funeral company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, where he was already awaited by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Lewite, and his wife Cristina.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, members of the military presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots to various parts of the body and a pardon shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The incident took place at kilometre 1.5 of the Cadereyta to Santiago highway at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, standing wide open.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately reported to the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
A metre away, the body of another person was lying in a red t-shirt and blue trousers.
All three lay on their stomachs.
According to the information obtained on the spot, the three people must have been murdered in another place, as no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house are inscriptions written by one organized gang of criminals to another, in addition, several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaria de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat of State for National Defence) introduced 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang, mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who are connected with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (hunt) and secret burials.
According to public information, eight people were initially arrested in the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured and the detainees confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6 a.m., soldiers found a car without a license plate with two occupants during their patrol in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the cart, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on 13 November at 2:00 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to flee at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government, which is supposed to deal with the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government, which is supposed to deal with the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of a government.
It is assumed that he will introduce a cabinet composed by a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of talks with political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well set up," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, headed by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by Europoliticals to regain the trapped confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti to hurry was further exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were subjected to a 7% interest rate for 10 years, in line with the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government in every possible way."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Montis’s chances of success were greatly enhanced by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are designed to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a technocrat-majority government that Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure with its remarks that Montis’ failure is a disaster.
Monti started on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations as well as with youth and women’s organisations.
The session is scheduled to end on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who in response to the crisis has set in motion an extremely rapid change of government.
After a brief inhalation towards the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would step down, uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister has pushed the cost of Italian government bonds back to critical limits.
Rescuing Italy with a national debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government should last until the next elections, expected in 2013, despite predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, a hint of their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties make it difficult to involve people in political life.
Spaniards have more playing opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on their hands.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 summoned has 50 games behind him.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendly game that will take place today at 3.05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José are compared players from both countries.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly rankings, can look back on a significant number of Class A selection games, the three-color team only has defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential Premier League clubs of England have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European cups such as the Champions League every year.
In addition, the experience of the Spanish Furia in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the world championships.
Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches as part of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who on last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 matches abroad reached an equaliser with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain will set a new record of 127 games abroad.
Xavi Hernández, player of Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition last week from UEFA, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta at 126 and Schalke's midfielder, Raúl González, at 102.
The number Hundred also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are left-handed forward Júnior Díaz with 48 games and forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five came out of over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games in the Spanish team have Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the side of the national team, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23 come to less than 30 games.
The rest is not even close to the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet took Costa Rica on tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is ready to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band assured them that a dream would come true for them if they played in Costa Rica.
This was confirmed by the band’s bassist and co-founder, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twentieth anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the interview, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is the second time we have played in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only been on vacation in Costa Rica once. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we’re sorry for the time it took us to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn’t that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve made over the past 21 years have taken place over the past two weeks.
We played on a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are passionate about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent places to surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour, you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we have no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
What's that?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision which we’re going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven’t played in a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and surprise them because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they might get forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think for the audience as well.
With this tour, you will celebrate your 20-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don’t think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years, and that seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are passionate about making music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to be active at the birth of Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Occasionally, a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual for five or ten groups to come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We’re excited to still be friends with them all and it’s an honor to be part of this Seattle sound coming up.
It’s also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is a lot more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all value ourselves to be still alive and also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One person trusts the other and his music, and we couldn't do better.
Your relationship with fame hasn’t always been easy; on the other hand, thanks to your success, you were always able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we’ve grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it brought into life, without failing to be a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
For three years, we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have spent so long together. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible man Andy was walking and how he made me laugh. It was always fun to talk to others and la freude
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best. That is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This is certainly going to be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
of so many+
The first ones I think of include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassist I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep Grunge alive even though it’s no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I think we all don’t feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think about the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it's great because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
What's that?
That’s interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little lightweight, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about themselves.
When I heard Ed playing it, my tears came to both of them, and they were very dark songs.
I think that when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life – for example, losing a family member or a friend – it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs embody that clearly for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the muscle loss of his legs, his home doctor said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who served 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which has been operated on and controlled four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal physician, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasticas to determine the reason for his pain and loss of muscle in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want to do so because he considered him innocent.
He was operated on four times on tongue cancer and lost 18 kilograms of weight, in addition to other conditions such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood flow problems in the legs, the doctor noted.
Fujimori has been in the detention center Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian Army Death Squad, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin its visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday, which, according to the president of Uruguay, will be the highlight of his busy schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón’s support regarding the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear to be tax havens from the international community, a statement rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world, and since January of this year there has been an agreement on exchanging tax information to avoid double investment with the South American country.
In recent years, the government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including countries that have not implemented all international standards on cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to rescue Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to stores around the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played three-dimensionally without a special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who needs to tell how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the head of the Spanish press specializing in Nintendo, at the launch of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game developed by Nintendo for this console from the very beginning" because hit articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman stressed that although it’s three-dimensional, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “accessible” video game that allows for a fast, fluid gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but in order to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", it must always be played three-dimensionally.
This trip of Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the character to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the latest editions: The mustache-bearded installer must overcome perilous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of portillos to the United States
Guatemalan President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would host the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to hold him accountable in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
Thus, the process ends with the U.S. request for Portillo’s extradition so that he can be brought to court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and government, taking into account that a ruling court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his government, he did not interfere in court decisions and accepted all extradition requests that were notified to him.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Coloms procedure is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional instances for the conviction of the former state president (2000-2004) are exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the impeachment of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This negotiation preceded the extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinihove has helped 6,000 young people threatened with social exclusion
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: In this quarter-century, 6,000 young people, threatened with social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a balance sheet was drawn yesterday at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low level of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous heads of institutions that have worked with the association for 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during election campaigns proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The Grand Hall of Fabra i Coats was also attended by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the General Director of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinihove was created in very difficult times and that the present times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinihove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house, where gigantic parties were held, was cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Balmes Street (Barcelona).
The twelve occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had occupied illegally and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation took place on judicial order without police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The occupants, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties were held on the three lower floors, lasting up to two days, and driving the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the beginning of the occupation of the house.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the occupants of the house made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while these in the discotheque cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the recreational space had been indicated by the neighbors for rest disturbance, while according to her, the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the occupiers of the house and in particular from the guests of the parties organized there, and which, according to the statements of the angry neighbors, became more and more in the last weeks.
The head of the discotheque said the harassment had been so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
Last week, the chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona's city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, called for the immediate removal of the building and the control of the problems of civic coexistence and the downfall of the district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months the occupants had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and take action against the asocial acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., police approached 35 Montral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people attempt to break into the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
A park or a mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The urban call for proposals on the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona anew.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its smear paper on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers to Central Park in New York.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that spreads not in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
The role of the yogi bear was no longer played by the Central Park, but by Yellowstone with wild boars.
That was the point when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's it, or someone's planning to put gates on the ground.
The question arises: Collserola, park or mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city, the topic of conversation in the mouth of all Barcelona architects.
It’s almost a recurring topic that two members of this old-groomed caste, who meet in the elevator, can turn to.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the fabric for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary", after the attack on the coast, to talk about the "front on the mountains", insofar as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has not been delivered about the green apples.
"One should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex,” the architect judges, for whom the title “Gate of Collserola” contains a “lexical trap”: one should not “imagine it as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which action must be taken.”
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban planning experience, considers the proposal to be an “intellectual challenge” that entails “some dangers”.
Dangers due to the "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it nowadays" following the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is one’s own limitation on what can be built.
“Limiting something always means setting the next step,” i.e., crossing it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [regarding the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, thinks, simplified, that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the patronage of Collserola, which should not "bump into deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for having given his board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guiding letter that allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams created ("the right thing," he says) should be a "only for Architek."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as Collserola's global view is lacking in the terms of the tender: "There have been 16 competitions tendered in cross-section," he says, "on the Axis Mountain-Sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
This, at least in his case, has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next door.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped in its entire length in such a way that a smooth transition between the city and green areas is created.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red’s attorney freed the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the trial that is being conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after being pardoned by Casino Red’s agent before the Second District Criminal Court, which is conducting the trial against the Mayor of Monterrey’s brother for blackmail.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration would approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal complaint, the prosecutor’s office opened a criminal case against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Old Quarter of the capital.
He remained at this place for 49 days after a second warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had dismissed the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta detention facility for allegedly bribing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, while he remained in the middle security area for only a few hours because of threats of murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as a prisoner of the San Nicolás de los Garza municipal prison.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the district, Jorge Yánez, handed him a detention order, which found that, after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to plead guilty to the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of this betting house.
This Monday, the Casino Red representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to issue the sentence to the mayor’s brother, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs assigned to the court, García Gómez, asked if he had repaired the damage and which owner of the betting house had given his pardon, but the lawyer withheld the name.
According to case 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is free to speak, and furthermore, no objections can be made against the trial, and no damages are claimed.
After hearing the representative of the betting house at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case would be filed.
He also informed him about the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake and seven other people died.
The Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident in which the Secretary of the Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, indicated that the helicopter with its entire undamaged structure can crash a arrow land directly against the ground, without the need for a landfall.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing was in contact with trees at 25 meters high, with the helicopter losing its hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why he met all the conditions for the transportation of personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigation into the area where the machine had landed.
"During the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the surcharge affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but they can take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial flew at travel speed and the plane fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the collision."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visibility:
In accordance with flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of sight flight, which means that the crew must have had sufficient sight during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the launch, with some deep-hanging clouds rising as it proceeded towards the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Point of impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are consistent, and there may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route prior to the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered airplane remains suggest that the helicopter with its intact structure was impacted on the ground.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane at the crash site do not close to fire or explosion.
The latest test results indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is steep and has an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area beyond the locked area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the undamaged aircraft structure had hit the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
The Social Security Agency of Mexico is conducting a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence" to find the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the IMSS sports grounds in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are conducted every Saturday from 8.00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began at the Cuauhtémoc sports ground (in the west of the state of Mexico) and will continue since October 8 at the Nezahualcóyolt sports ground (in the east of the state of Mexico).
When the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study will continue on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and conclude on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to get to know the factors and the role of genetics associated with the development of obesity and to identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he stated that it is aimed at that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should complete nutritional questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He further concluded that on those Saturdays the subjects measured (weight, size, waist circumference), controlled their blood pressure and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes associated with obesity in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concerns of health professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that one Mexican is on average 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity is expressed in the inability to burn out the excess energy (calories) that we take, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants would be a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the results of the measurements and suggest to them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using transportation rather than walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents impact holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM develops polymer-modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs that emerge from the road surface were fully observed, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 impact holes when the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the Valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico.
In his lecture "Blowholes from a technical point of view", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which has a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera suggested that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of impact holes.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthens. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic tensile behavior.
The resilient behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180° C., at 120° C. it is very resilient and at 50° C. almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in a day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer concluded.
The FQ researcher noted that the roads of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road surface composed of six layers of material, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalt-built and then hardened stones.
Every single stone of this layer of wear was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows for a good force distribution in the road surface.
“If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed,” said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer," he explained, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
Which receives and distributes the most forces, the support layer also needs a suitable thickness and the material of which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are further, important factors to consider, especially the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes moist, water penetrates the layer and is difficult to get out again, which causes a softening of all layers of the road surface and consequently the appearance of impact holes.
If a punching hole is formed," he said, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that in order to avoid frequent impact holes these regulations are complied with.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the impact holes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the del Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th title.
Once again Valle del Cauca was empty in awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for standing on the winner’s stage, displaying a silver crown and the band she identifies as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena (Girona), where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar (Girona), the department is already on 14 mission titles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands (198), Lorela (198), Clarela (198), Misses (198), Miriam Ospina (1947) Alnoit (198).
The big question many people ask themselves today is: What was missing?
For the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not in vain had she been elected Queen of the Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also had the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received the following after the Kroe.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the jury’s decision to appoint her as First Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question “Which book influenced you the most and why?”, which was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
I read a lot, I believe quite a lot in literature, I think it is a way of civilizing myself, in the end, I believe that the book that most shaped my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a rather deep-rooted book.
I'm currently reading 'Guilt and Atonement'. It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Passion'.
An answer that encountered little opposition, firstly because of the term 'civilize yourself' and secondly because it had not specifically explained how each of the books mentioned by her had influenced her.
But after completing the ceremony, Melina declared that she felt calm and happy with the result: “The universe is wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for all people, please read "The Little Prince" a little bit. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burnt out.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the favorite, who had received all the accolades and had received all the awards in advance (Oster gastronomy competition, public vote on the best handmade costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates could not have been jealous of what the king had stressed."
And this was evident in her first performance in her swimsuit at the Hilton hotel’s beach and in her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she was sure to perform with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" on the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition will not eventually become queen".
In addition, Valle went out of his way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia; one must look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already participated in projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrosis, which was noted to her in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury selected her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutritional habits and more responsible work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with fibrosis on the abdomen, which was hardly noticeable to me honestly, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the fault of the Valle del Cauca woman was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“The surgeries are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this job had to pay for it.”
Because of this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in the swimsuit, a cruel prediction arose, which was to come true at night. It was rumored that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize so as not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that’s true or not, the fact is that Melina will start her reign year from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscopist from Cali entered history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4th, a lophoscopist of the Investigative Unit of the Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali entered as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI’s department, Eliasar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years, had a standby service this week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
On Friday night he flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one could be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, because it was not in the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a peasant in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
Fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of telling Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was actually the head of the FARC.
In Search of Traces
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the recognition given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in solving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murders and robberies, and confirm the identity of the persons arrested.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false IDs or have none.
We'll take their fingerprints and look them up in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house in the event of a theft, because the thief had leaned right there with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also be used to relieve or burden murder suspects.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by bottles of wine.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object using chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a plant cell or ribbon is used to carry them.
Afterwards, the prints are sent to Asif, the criminal database, or to the police station.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without IDs," the CTI expert said.
He said that not everything is as it would be depicted in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, so not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if a corresponding comparison is made.
The "importants" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Much of it followed the eviction order and changed its location to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being evicted in the early morning hours and trying to occupy another spot on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Zuccotti Square, which they wanted to access with a judicial order allowing the "insurgents" to re-enter the tents at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held on to the eviction order and occupied a park further north of the city.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the pitch, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means for the return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray stated that the response of the "insurgents" to the evacuation of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent evacuation of the square and the protesters from approving the tent.
In addition, the "Inquired" occupied a new park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey and owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour. But afterwards, police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give accurate figures. He assured Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs among them.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had arrived at the spot, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, which will analyse the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn.
Some of the square-driven protesters carried photocopies of this judicial order and distributed them, even giving them to some police officers guarding the square, which resulted in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, indicating that some policemen had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as applying “laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this judicial order, the reopening of the square for public transport and the protesters had been cancelled, pointing out to the protesters that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the early morning evacuation of the Zuccotti square, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violated the law."
Bloomberg said he had given the order to clear the place because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people" because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents "feared for their lives".
“The early morning eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not the interests of North American workers,” the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of the press.”
Officials at Occupy Wall Street said they are considering organising "big actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that have lasted since the protests on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas TV show of Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will perform on December 1 in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program, in which Anderson - who also appears for the distribution on the Internet of a self-reported porn, in which she, along with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears - as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap, who portrays Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American origin who recently worked as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's My Violent Torpedo of Truth, appears as a Jesus child.
CTV’s Christmas program focuses not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, Bublé had referred to North American Kim Kardashian as a “hure” during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is being reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the free fall spiral from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still in recovery from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster Japan has experienced since World War II.
The government’s first estimates in Tokyo estimated the property damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to be waning despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of continuous cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finally complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the rate calculated for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan, the financial year starts in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The revival can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decline of 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nonetheless, the actual upheaval of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian pushbacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the bleak forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that weighs like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid recovery of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The prospects are really not very encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member states had shown clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brakes had been pulled by the largest economic powers.
He dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is at 100, after falling by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be passed, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums of peripheral countries pushed up and uncertainty spreading, Greece continues to get lost in the maze that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the “consensus” of the new Greek transitional government is more a response to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowly being substantiated by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon in his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not back the new austerity measures to Ford.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with the confidence vote for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
However, Samara’s statement does not dispel doubts about his position: “We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing.”
The Conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unlock the $8 billion that Athens urgently needs, making it clear that he would not approve a commitment to comply with the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still annoyed by the effects of the poker game with Papandreou referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand was not to be shaken: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "would not make a clear written agreement as soon as possible."
Ministry of Economy spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the Troika inspectors would return to Athens “very soon” to discuss with the new government “what is needed for the payment of the sixth section” of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek knuckle still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position with regard to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Yesterday, Queen Sofía of Spain recalled that in the last two decades Spain has become the second donor worldwide for this means of international cooperation. Its "being" rests on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity on the basis of human trust".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Minority Loans in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely necessary" in order to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015, thus "with the goal of achieving the millennium goals set by the United Nations , with the goal of achieving the "in particular number of people living under a dollar , and the
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly", noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will be based on the summit, which lasts until Thursday in particular, "are best suited to the creation of new capacities and better capacities."
"We have had many successes" and "facing many challenges."
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to incite "two fundamental goals".
By the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and 10 million of these households will cross the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus “years ago”, which Queen Sofia considers an “act of justice and recognition”.
She described the father of this funding instrument as an “admirable idealist who has dedicated himself to fighting poverty” and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the local loan strategy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first world summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. With all of us "we have been able to observe a continuous further development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday explained her the assessment as a "family leader" in Valladolid and as "the poorest".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity is “an ethical commandment” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believed that microcredit was a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty”, and that the governments of the industrialized countries should now “more than ever” work on solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, lamented "the success", "marginalized" people who "always stand before closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendees in a city, the "solidarity" of which "their gates are the most
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president on the basis of general voting
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, November 14th in Leipzig passed for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who consider the government policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The Presidency's proposal for a European Commission presidency was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten abstained.
The several-minute standing ovation, which was initially held by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, was open to any doubt on the part of the three finance ministers inclined towards Europe.
The Chancellor's main idea, as well as the application, bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a revision of the Lisbon Treaty which reinforces the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals passed by Congress, to which Wolfgang Schäuble Pate clearly stood.
Surely it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been set.
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal of weighting each country in the ECB’s Governing Council according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously led to a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor, who is thinking of calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the troubled European countries, who would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the European motion addresses the significance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in the case of sickness reports?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now taking care of the sickness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family welfare fund and deliver a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
To accompany this attack, which is based on an effort to put the economy to the test, but on the other hand is no less a precursor to a right-wing presidential campaign axis, the majority wants to focus on employee sickness reports.
First of all, with a budgetary objective: the government is considering the introduction of a fourth quarantine day before taking into account a sickness report for employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the four-day salary without the specific company’s permission, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that threatens to incite anger, according to the daily "Les Echos", but would help to raise 280 million euros.
And that would go hand in hand with another rather symbolic measure: granting state officials an unpaid quarantine day in case of illness (unlike the three quarantine days in the private sector, there is no quarantine period for them so far).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also rekindles the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absence from work.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, these will be rewarded if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, in front of RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraud in the field of sickness reports seems somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, it has been the subject of permanent monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no more often sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s start with the country-wide figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Agency CNAM, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Healthcare, the daily allowances in 2008 amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion 5% of health expenditure.
This figure included 46% for maternity leave and work accidents and 54% for sick leave, which is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That’s 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French received an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that conceals some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, this time recorded by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of sickness reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% over.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are no more likely to be incapacitated than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absenteeism rate (caused by illness or otherwise) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% or 16% in the United Kingdom and 18% in the United Kingdom.
Fraud in sickness reports represents a disappearingly small proportion of black labor.
With regard to the fraud, only a weak margin is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on sickness reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College of Technicians and Engineers) found under 1.5 million checks that 13% of the 285,000 short-term sickness reports realized, that is, in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
For the systematically controlled sickness reports of more than 45 days duration, there were among 1.2 million 11% of "unadapted or unjustified" cases, that is 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have filed a sickness report.
A number that represents only a weak outlay compared, for example, to that of black labor.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion in tax gains per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus significantly more than the defrauding of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment program to intercept its economy.
This had been announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament on Monday, November 14, adding to the fact that the one hundred days granted by his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners as well as a new programme for budget adjustment," the head of government said in his first public speech at the start of the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone is "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the country's state deficit "to the 9%" of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after which it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, on Monday gave his approval to the measures already approved regarding an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but anticipated that his party would not be ready to apply for an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a parliamentary meeting of his party New Democracy.
He had agreed to reduce budget deficits and debts, as well as to fight waste, but was hostile to any policy that would stop the economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner entrusted with economic and monetary tasks, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of more than 8 billion euros without the written guarantee of all parties about their support of the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would suffice and he would not undergo anything of pressure.
Euthanasia and the accompanying death must be legalized, according to an expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, reports from the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors are working together on pain relief treatment to provide the best painkillers, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society is in a state of denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually allow themselves to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts who are interlinked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this choice takes place, namely in patients deemed capable of making such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts quote a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which had compared the quality of deaths in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has ranked 10th in this, the study notes that "medical obstetrics in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians wanting to die at home, 68.6% of those in the hospital eventually die.
Viewed from across the country, the rate of 86% of hospital deaths is highest in Quebec.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report draw conclusions which are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already established that it does not wish to make any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to the experts, who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would involve misconduct in its application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or non-committing suicide.
On the contrary, there are significantly more cases of such violations, especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Accompanying suicide is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
According to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, 85% of Canadians had already opted for euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not result in conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
With regard to those who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
Regarding the maintenance or discontinuation of funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Likewise, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the decommissioning of funds for which a valid rejection has been submitted should not be considered a criminal offence.
The panel of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect end-of-life cessation without having to fear prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors are working together on pain relief treatment to provide the best painkillers, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, with regard to the pain relief or life-ending measures already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Panel calls for consideration, at least, of these measures, since they were used as little as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and reduce it.
Reservations made by other experts
Some experts in the field of health care law have already raised reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts as “extreme” among other things, as it does not set any limits to the practice of euthanasia in patients in the final stages.
“This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is life-tired and older than 18 asks another person to help him with his suicide,” said RA Deschamps, who had gone through a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social work of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guides and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed “strong resistance” to the report’s findings, which she titled a “pro-euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the reports regarding the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria Is Isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad, who, however, opposes it thanks to the support of Russia and rejects a “complot” directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before Syria’s withdrawal from the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, have taken a stance in favor of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the incumbent Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "depose his power in Syria", in which some 40 civilians and members of the government power were already killed.
"If Bashar's country's interest was at heart, he would resign, but beyond that, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and are unable to satisfy them must go," he said, referring to Syria, the neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, for its part, has welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have struck an increasingly sharpening tone in the face of the repression in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the governmental force in the Dar'a region in southern Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed in "shifts and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Mulalim, however, was of the view that the country "taxes towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted with insistence to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
Syria “will not give in,” he added, adding that “the plots forged against Syria would fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a “protection mechanism for civilians” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which, according to him, encapsulates itself in its "paranoia".
A planned re-assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for a crisis exit, decided on November 2, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities, as well as the release of detained protesters.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Arab League’s decision yesterday was “incorrect” to guard against advocating any sanctions against Damascus, despite China already urging Syria to implement the exit plan.
ITALY
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has demanded from the markets a little more time to form his staff and implement a program that calls for “victims” to regain credit lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
Yesterday, the former EU Commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties ahead of today’s meeting between trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the current President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, for his part, had been eager to wait for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence in parliament by Friday to make sure the new government had sufficient support.
The negotiations will culminate in the presentation by Monti of a list of deletions, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock and bond markets called for their time.
In a democracy, "there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, noting that it is "certain that the markets will show themselves diligent and prudent".
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the turmoil had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The current prime minister is supposed to establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had emphasized that he would like to involve "politicians" as well.
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the certificate of confidence from Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself, since taking office, to working urgently towards the goal of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even taking into account the new government".
In particular, the EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of budget compensation in 2013 despite the savings plans adopted in recent months, has applied for new hardship measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, the head of Italy's chiefs, who will meet on Tuesday at Monti, also insists on the need for economic stimulus, "because a country that has no growth to show, which cannot respect deficit indicators".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "change of epoch" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will have to raise 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-capsule, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS based the result on the recently published report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concern" over a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of ISIS’s IAEA documents, the 1934-born Danilenko apparently worked for over three decades at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the early 1960s and was involved in the explosion-produced production of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to start a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds".
In 1995, his company’s economic difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentioned "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear explosive system "has been supported by the work of a foreign expert who is not only extremely skilled in this technique, but also, as a member of the IAEA's military program, has communicated his entire professional career in this field to the military."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated crimes of violence have either slightly decreased or have only slightly increased in the same period, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, as well as a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes are criminal offences.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 in a very weak mav, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes re-growing,” Human Rights First said. “The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant,” the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First had long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," said Paul Legendre, a senior official at the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these assaults,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving police attitudes towards “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" is a legacy of the era of the civil rights struggle in U.S. federal law.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion or descent and now also involves crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and becoming more and more similar to Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter introduced changes to the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to monitor the activities of those who follow their posts, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") you follow and who follow your messages.
This allows you to find out if these allow you to track your messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new menu offer had been tested on a small percentage of users prior to its general distribution on the internet on Monday, according to Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with something esoterically pleasing wording (RT for referenzierter Wiederholung des Beitrags einer anderen Person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) making the happiness of the insiders, thus opening up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the networks large public Google Facebook and Facebook.
In the network, users debated about this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" via the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive and looks too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
“The ‘Activity’ feature will help me track certain elements of my Flux Twitter better,” <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austro-Hungarian
Incorporation of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The ruling government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to incorporate a "Golden Budget Rule" into the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also a possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating agency.
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who personally announced this decision to leave the Council of Ministers, even though the public debt of Austria is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty, but far below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency hadn't fallen from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion of interest each year," said Michael Spindelegger, deputy chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria is also demanding the Brussels summit of the eurozone member states on 26 October: the heads of state and government would then have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to the public account balance in the constitution or by enacting an equivalent law.
The measure adopted by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit is expected to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, as of 2017, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while the regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eradicate the budgetary debts under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens to intervene in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the currency markets if the yen continues to rise.
"If we find excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene just as we did last time," Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen again accelerated close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar in order to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of driving a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen regularly over it, doped by purchases from investors who see the yen as “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted by the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency is damaging the archipelago’s exports, as it increases the cost of “Made in Japan” products and reduces the value of income drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as these exchange them in national currency.
“Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku (northeast) region,” stresses M. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the yen could kill the weak rise already in the bud.
With growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - the third world economic power has regained traction for the first time this year thanks to the booming export growth and consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that the yen’s price increase does not reflect “the economic foundations of Japan”.
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, meanwhile, has urged the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to devalue the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, the institute's deputy governor, said the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures" and said no additional currency easing was expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its purchases of government bonds by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) to offset the 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) hedging amounts it had spent on various purchases of financial securities in order to transfer the market to liquidity.
Eurozone:
Interest rates are rising fast, stock exchanges are pulling back
The contagious risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the new heads of government taking office in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, drift further into negative fields this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“Given the new tensions regarding the yields of sovereign bonds in the eurozone in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to release part of their recent profits.
“Capital investors are nervous and aware of the risk of infection too well,” Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, said in a statement.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a fall of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its bail on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, so it fell by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, had accepted a request that provides in particular the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at very disturbing levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds reached 6.85% at 10 years, while that of Spanish bonds matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October is "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visir of the markets as parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The "spread" between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historical high.
Expecting Eurozone growth figures
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the INSEE Federal Statistical Office had revised the decrease of the figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most worries economic experts.
Germany, on the other hand, experienced 0.5% growth over the same period.
The eurozone is expected to face a first upturn at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or because of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power as well as the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an occasion to reflect on this issue as well as on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will bear fruit only if it explores the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution drives a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to renounce a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce steadily electricity without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision subject to the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which just now intends to build only the latest generation of nuclear power plants.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, has decided to join another unit in its park after Fukushima by re-introducing the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is oriented towards renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European leader in wind energy, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; on the basis of this, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the sustainability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
As the energy price in the globalized economy plays a key role in competitiveness as well as in the stability of industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a sharp increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not willing to pay as much as they are resisting the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a myriad of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
Should France decide to withdraw from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to work for sixty years if the downfall of its manufacturer is preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is no such thing as a devil’s work as a miraculous means of generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of security is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent inspections in existing plants, such as at the construction site in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are obsessed with the idea of security.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disruptions.
Only one, namely Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was summoned by reactor construction as well as inexorable, human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that allows it to be resilient to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable by the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by letting them take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that determines our country’s economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading police, judiciary and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had titled itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students by the authorities had shaped the weekly shows, the interior minister had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need any talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right, the voice of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left, was struck by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 had stated that France "cannot take up all the poverty of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
Fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the right and the left in 2005.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande confines himself to trivialities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point to us in a recently published work, which summarizes the latest findings regarding immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a confluence of positives among the specials.
Restricting immigration would weaken growth and harm the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to replace the local workforce, especially the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience has shown that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage earners, as they focus heavily on occupations in sectors that are unburdened by workplace technology.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local wage-earners, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not equal to the job offer.
Positive salary effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
In this way, Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in the immigrant flow will result in a related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought in by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas as well as economic growth (a high proportion of nationalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in European countries on average about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a 30-year-old immigrant to Germany contributes an average net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
These said teeth, which should deter immigrants, however, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had let the whole 20th century go about the tragedies of World War I, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy overcome its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon"the little one", that it was a feature of the mental attitude.
The universal suffrage, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can become just as well an "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is equally and above all a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind in the Greek True-False referendum would have been twofold revealing in this regard: once the need for a powerful return to politics, and on the other hand also those of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which has been organised according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European single ruler or a leap with eyes closed into the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, with full right, clarified and constant, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we no longer know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bows to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and hence each of the nations that joins it.
The urgency is to return the leadership of the European project to popular sovereignty.
It is up to the Europeans as a whole to reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and build a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is conditional on decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy without leading us to certainty of destruction.
After this proposal has long been contested by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is now pushing European economic leadership to do so.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it is suggesting to the citizens - would be a new folly and a further impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not afford it.
This teaching continues to be valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become common goods
The World Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 was to end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most powerful segment is the contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or settlement of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to 320 million sold a year ago, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payments, after a long lag in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
The consumer markets, however, are steaming.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing over to their customers bank cards equipped with contactless chips in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment via mobile
However, this is only a first step on the way to the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
An ever-lowering percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to carry out these transactions.
"They've been delayed".
"But at least next year they should see a real upward development."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Yesterday, the Société Générale also announced the launch of an offer that allows its customers to make contactless mobile payments.
Terrorist Front, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspicious relationship between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to be confirming.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now "gained certainty" about it.
"The way the two organizations are acting, as well as the relationship between the intelligence agencies, indicates a clear cooperation," he said without going into further detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
Investigations into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January have helped establish interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi supporters, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the site.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the guided telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that was the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that you have to wait for clearer evidence before you can talk about an operational collaboration between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it is conceivable."
"It has been known for years that the cult receives financial and intellectual support from Auven and that it is increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more obvious in their course, as have the speeches and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the withdrawal of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by A.
The international community, to begin with Washington, has since put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of Illuminati that does not need to be given special attention.
Fast successes
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this deprived region, the merger is rapidly gaining momentum.
It politicizes itself and demands strict adherence to Sharia law, while its affiliated activists engage in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially targeted churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in their intensified attacks on the police station.
However, the reaction on the part of Abuja is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, counting 800 dead.
Mohamed Yusuf, who was taken into captivity, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its fortress in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an attack in Jos that claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide attack that took place at the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will become a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis operating from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat at the center of the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem and showed himself ready to "communicate all clues".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and ignorance about China, Iraq, and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say, simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate in this way, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow fighters have repeatedly made their thunderous statements, as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional Republican focus.
Slogans are falling on China, Iran, and Israel aid – often unsupported in any way.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney, the highest in the course, threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation" - the leading theme in an America that is irritated at the top by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Stupid running if this is meant to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a ripe outlook on foreign policy, has nearly squeezed the air with regard to his emotionally flattering gesture.
He had called for a hands-on but constructive dialogue with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney also praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions to stop the nuclear program failed.
“If I am elected, I will order Iran to stop,” he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
In addition, he promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of commitments to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, in turn, bears a shameful ignorance of the file.
Recently, he called for China’s military threat to be countered by Beijing’s “attempts to develop a nuclear power” – and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, in turn boasts that he is ready to take the U.S. Army into service in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s 2009 ban on resorting to torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an outspoken weight.
Contrary to the current presidential counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was also an amateur and had to put water in his wine, as far as anti-terrorism was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive talks with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his “boy” from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this enmity is not so unforced.
The population is rather appreciative of the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has shut down bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprised more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It will supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with splendor and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, on the Baltic Sea coast with orchestral sound and fine-tasting buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte symbolically jointly turned the control of the valve that transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas will be delivered to Western Europe each year through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already have the possibility of building a third line on the route itself.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this huge structure seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: it is now becoming more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not shy about comparing the Nord Stream pipeline with a “new German-Soviet pact” in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of a deconsolidation of European energy, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has achieved its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong gas consumption and their gas reserves are dwindling.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete cladding, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m depth.
During its construction, minefields dating back to World War II had to be evaded.
“Around a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed because of caution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, reinforced measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long string of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from doing so, as the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state company permanently settling at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be unlikely, as the weld seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes from a sea vessel, and by an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, has a diameter of one meter, is introduced into the interior of the pipe and is moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal on arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (respectively at 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunion and the French group of companies GDF Suez (respectively at 9%).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, on an extendable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the amount of gas actually transported," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs for both pipelines are expected to amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are determined to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline is located on a sandy, pine forested coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other metrics of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style again.
It has a flair of adventure, with hours spent writing at candlelight.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular inlay, its rubber band, the egg shell-colored sides, as it ages over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, at the time decided to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company’s specialist consultant, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton varnish used, for example, for covering upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was very popular among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has resurrected an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now head of brand at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of buyers, as the notebook fascinates businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially employed 12 people, now employs more than 100 people and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookshops, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the time and its new need for writing, which exists despite the rise of emails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, the company also released a leopard pattern cover.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural spirit and knew how to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the entire range of articles.
In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, which is today Syntegra Capital, thus opening a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today begins the 15th week of work for disabled people.
Despite a purposeful public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average: 19% versus 9% unemployment of the total population.
Encouraging?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, director general of the Adapt Association, which hosts the "Work Week for the Disabled."
"The progress achieved within fifteen years is significant."
At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times higher.
“There is still a lot of work to be done.”
However, it must be said that many barriers continue to exist for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common in the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very prevalent: 53% for the disabled compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to resume work and that form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, General Manager of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The unspoken remains, the mental attitudes, which are certainly developing but slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entrepreneurship for the magazine La Cité stated that the surveyed managers have "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled people", which is "overrepresented" by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually impaired.
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers set out in a 1987 law.
These last-mentioned figures, dating from 2008, refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now at about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization tasked with collecting contributions from companies that disregarded the law.
The proof: The number of "fees paying" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for contribution increases, created a strong pressure on companies," Pierre Blanc said.
"But this improvement also expresses real insight, especially in the large group of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of workplaces employ people with disabilities between 20 and 49 employees, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Even before they faced the "Blue Tuesday evening" (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed the pleasure that the friendly game brought them.
It would be too far-fetched to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been happy to make peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise regarding his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures.
As for the contrast between his representation in club and national team"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to get to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought on Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "gloss".
However, without omitting the note of "pleasure".
He has led the French national team since the age of 7 and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I have always been supported,” he said.
This inevitably contributes to further reinforce the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
"We just ran across the road."
"To be allowed to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, sounded "proud" with kindness.
"The Pride of a Galamatch."
"Pride" also to confirm - in its capacity as"neighbours" - that France"has become a team at a very high level again", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... and in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward with great optimism to the rematch against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams were lacking in materiality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and an opponent to serve, namely Bosnia.
Given the playoffs (0-0) on Friday in Zenica’s hell, it seems obvious that the dice have not fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was not able to put on the important stamp that would have taken the pressure off it.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, as we haven't scored an outside goal."
At home, however, at their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves up in front of an audience that may be equally fierce at the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very scarce", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being in the 2012 European Championship," Carlos Queiroz's successor said.
The draw in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, as we have not achieved an outside goal," said Bento.
“We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese intended to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "do not allow them time to think".
A good idea, provided it is put into practice this time.
