The number of new recruits preparing to be sent to Donbass from Ukraine has been named
The official representative of the People’s Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) Andrei Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass.
According to him, in this way, Kiev plans to "somehow complete the units".
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals led to a low staffing of the units," Marochko said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians called into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev began the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces operation (JFO).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to a stronger role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass worsened due to the assassination of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities described the incident as a terrorist attack.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained in the course of the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by Ukrainian intelligence services.
U.S. officials have forced Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors
US businessman Elon Musk will step down as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla at the request of the US authorities.
To settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.
According to CNBC, a pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Mask to remain in the leadership position at Tesla.
At the same time, he must pay $20 million and leave the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days from the date of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is clarified that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders with a statement that there were sufficient funds to buy the shares of the company and filed a lawsuit against the entrepreneur.
The businessman tweeted that he wanted to buy Tesla shares for $420 a piece, but he never did.
After the tweet, the company’s shares grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British Foreign Office compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member states of the community.
The diplomat made a statement at a congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union would only worsen the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks had stalled.
She commented on the outcome of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place by April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
The question of the Irish border remains open.

Telegram users complained about a failure in the work of the new version
iPhone users complained about problems in the work of the messenger Telegram after the update, released on September 28.
The phone number of the user can be found by his username
Complaints concern gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after the update, the app shows a white screen or closes immediately.
The messenger's representatives responded to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in the Swift language.
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the application until troubleshooting.
On April 13, the Tagansky court in Moscow granted Roskomnadzor’s request for the blocking of the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the telecom operators began to execute the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence needed to obtain data about the terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a terrorist suspected user upon receiving a court ruling.
The Telegram audience after the blockade in the Russian Federation decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk is forced to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of chairman of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Mask to retain the post of Tesla CEO.
The founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be demanded from Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is on the list of the 50 richest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the CEO of SpaceX, the neurotechnology company Neuralink, and the developer of Tesla’s electric cars, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his announcement on Twitter about a possible takeover of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The share price of $420 was set “because of the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana,” Bloomberg reported earlier, citing co-director of the commission’s security department, Stephen Pekin.
Elon Musk later declined his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said he considers the allegations of fraud unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
“Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way,” the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the posts of the businessman brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the tweets of the businessman misled, which is why Tesla stock sellers were forced to buy papers at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that the careless statements of Elon Musk led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Elon Musk also accused the head of research company Citron Research of stock market manipulation.
Meanwhile, if Musk had not been able to settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been threatened with removal from management of the company and even prison.
This was reported by former chairman of the commission, Harvey Pitt, on CNBC.
Musk is a “good guy who can’t manage a car company.”

The RPC compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the fascists
Metropolitan Volokolamsky Hilarion, Head of the Department of External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Volokolamsky Hilarion - on the causes of conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, possible church split and its political subtext
According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage”, to rename the church is the same as in fascist Germany “to pin Jews on a yellow six-pointed star”.
“This means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created,” a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church told Russia 24.
The metropolitan also emphasized that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, because "those who believe in this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country".
UOC urged the exarchs of Constantinople to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: the enslag, the Russian car and the return of Kvyat
Over the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Kozak, summarizing the results of the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the launch of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
The Deputy Prime Minister also shared the opinion on the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso and appreciated the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula 1.
The result of our meeting with car manufacturers should be in the foreseeable future the creation of a Russian Formula 1 car, which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to encourage our car manufacturers in this direction.
We were talking about plans until 2024, but I don’t think it’s possible in such a timeframe.
I think more realistic deadlines will be in the next ten years.”
From 2012 to 2014, the Marusya team competed in Formula 1 under a Russian license.
According to the deputy prime minister, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a national team in the world car racing championship in the "Formula 1" class.
I know that in Russia there are fans of motorsport, wealthy businessmen, who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian team "Formula 1", - he said.
“We are ready to support them morally.
Let’s hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team appeared, including because in Sochi there was such an infrastructure.
Tomorrow, the Sochi Autodrome is waiting for a stopover.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to implement all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even at the qualifications the stands were practically filled, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year grew by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the use of Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will add even more attractiveness to Sochi.
Dmitry Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian motorsport fans - the return of Daniel Kvyat to "Toro Rosso".
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success in the next season," the deputy prime minister told Izvestia.
He is a very hopeful driver.
Next year, for the first time in history, two major Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 crew at once.
Although the future fate of Sergei Sirotkin in the "Royal Races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not impressive: he took the 18th place in the qualification of the Russian Grand Prix.
We hope that next season our main drivers will be more than this year,” said Dmitry Kozak.

With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the ancient diseases, previously considered incurable, - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote: "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France he did more than dozens of divisions."
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic has saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, our wife and I paid attention to this wordy Russian-speaking guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming in full growth we had to observe in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, near the main arena for the Corrida de la Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, famous Spanish matadors set up a monument to the man, whose efforts they believe have saved the lives of hundreds of outstanding masters of the corrida.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at another time and not at all about it.

Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow ("Iron Man", "Shakespeare's Love") married producer Brad Falchuck.
Although rumors about their wedding were still going on in April, the couple officially concluded only now - on September 29.
According to People magazine, the private ceremony took place at the Paltrow House on Long Island.

Google will pay $9 billion to remain the default search engine in Apple’s Safari browser.
According to Business Insider, next year payments will increase to $12 billion.
Last year, Google paid $3 billion for this option.

Trump talks about “love” for Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and North Korea almost fell in love with each other, joked Donald Trump.
U.S. President Donald Trump noted a successful joke about his successes on the front of the settlement of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have corrected the relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other, said the US president.
The White House spokesman recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem as the main difficulty in foreign policy from the previous administration.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team had so launched relations with the DPRK that they couldn’t even reach the country’s leadership – they simply didn’t answer the phone.
The U.S. and DPRK were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House “beautiful letters,” Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also “cruel” to Kim Jong-un, which, by the way, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders “love each other.”
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media interpret them as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that recently Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests, and is also closing military sites.
All this is thanks to the work of his administration, I am sure the American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered about Kim Jong-un from the stand of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that the sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore

Positive results of the meeting were the cessation of the nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps on the way to denuclearization of North Korea are dragging on.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States had already sent the DPRK several disarmament scenarios, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangsters".

Nice called for the displacement of the "Moscow language by the Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the cleanliness of her native language, Larisa Nitsa, called for the expulsion of "Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language" from Ukraine.
To do this, she proposes a Ukrainian product - "a cultural wave, a cultural push".
Nice shared her thoughts on “the expediency of the eradication of the Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian edition of The Observer.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will “recover” from this “Moscow language,” she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, Russian speech was previously widely used on television and radio, but in the public space it was practically not left.
At the same time, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "an extension of the borders for Ukrainian language at the legislative level".
Previously, Nice shared her experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-language regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue the Watsons network of bookstores, the cashier of which communicated with her in Russian.
Without getting his own, Nita threw a toast at the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians she calls "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in the writing of surnames.
Recently, Nice said that the name “Russia” was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer’s anger could not escape even the Security Service of Ukraine: coming there and hearing the conversations of the employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, knocking on the door.
During the break, they had a male conversation, and it brought its fruits.
The defender of "Ural" Denis Kulakov - about the victory over "Arsenal" (2:1) in the game of the ninth round of the championship of Russia.
"Dennis, what do you think led to the victory?"
“I think we wanted to win more,” Kulakov said on the official Ural website.
"So a difficult game turned out, we had a serious male conversation during the break, and it brought its fruits: we scored two balls and did not miss.
"You missed a few games because of the injury you got earlier this month.
How did you feel today?”
"If you've lasted 90 minutes, it's okay!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe there's a little shore power at the end so that nothing happens.
And so, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they thank them very much!
“What about the atmosphere on the team?”
"It's no secret that after winning and recovering it is easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We must continue in the same spirit and please the fans.”
"Did you miss the game when you weren't on the field?"
"There is one thing that I missed a little bit, because really, an unpleasant situation has emerged.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors for putting them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and delighted the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

At the referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents related to violations of electoral law were recorded in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of the polling stations, four incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.
At the polling station in the elementary school "Lazo Angelovski" in Skopje, the 22-year-old K.J. violated public order and calm, insulted citizens and attacked police officers.
He was arrested and taken to the police station.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all the violators were immediately taken to the police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations are being verified.
“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can safely exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We urge citizens to comply with the laws and abstain from any violations of public order and tranquility and any violations of voting secrecy,” the spokesman said.
Citizens are asked in a referendum on Sunday to answer one question: “Do you support membership in the EU and NATO by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?”
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on 17 June during a ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which crosses the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
This treaty should not only resolve a long-standing dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way for Skopje to NATO and the EU.

Pashinyan added that early elections are a “demand of the people”, as well as part of the government’s program, which the parliament voted for.

The Serbian leader made a corresponding statement during the press conference, reports the local newspaper Vecernje News.
According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that, talking about the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support on the example of Syria.
Aleksandr Vucic said that he does not want to allow a scenario in which some major military clashes can occur on the territory of the state.
The President of the country has promised to make every effort to preserve the peace, reports the publication.
We add that according to the information of the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for next Tuesday, October 2, writes "Lenta.ru".
A day earlier, it became known that the Serbian president had brought the state army into full combat readiness due to the situation with Kosovo.
We are talking about the events of last Friday, when dozens of special forces of Kosovo entered the territory, which is adjacent to the lake, which supplies water to the hydroelectric power plant "Gazivode".
It is clarified that the specified power station is located on the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time belongs to the Serbian energy system.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in a negative key was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of Russia as an integral participant in the solution of global world problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years with regard to Russia, has now been much more muted,” the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with the Ebola fever, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this rank, at least, in the exposition of a group of Western countries".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, “the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent”.
"If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Foreign Minister of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not completely accurate," - the politician drew attention, noting that Russia "was no longer a blow to some wall".
The head of the profile committee of Sovfeda does not rule out that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, “will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may fully manifest itself in a year, two, three.”
“I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be pivotal,” Kosachev added, explaining that “too many examples of how with Russia’s connection it is possible to move forward in international affairs.”
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," he added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an "adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of today".
“I wouldn’t want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that somewhere we’re going through a point where movement is no longer going backwards, it’s going forwards,” he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context Kosachev called "the request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I was present at many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago, the Russian opinion, the Russian vision that occurs in the
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "in the so-called new liberal order, which is embodied with the West, there are no answers to the questions of how to solve the world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East.
“And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious,” Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers in this sense “the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia”.

Damascus declares its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the Foreign Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic Walid Muallem.
According to him, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the withdrawal of militants of the banned organization Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports RIA Novosti.
The head of the foreign ministry also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates in case the Kurds aspire to separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the talks with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.

Onyshchenko holds the post of the first vice-chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.

ADG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" is breaking another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that Germans are seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a coveted destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most evident in recent social surveys, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AdG broke another record, rising to the second place in the ranking of popular sympathies.
The right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of the popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it cannot be ignored the fact that the ADG created in 2013 from a small group of eurosceptic economists managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in general continues to hold the ruling HSS/CDS bloc, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points – back in April, Angela Merkel’s support was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48% of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7% lower than last year.
The Social Democrats were followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The Alternative for Germany party was created in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government’s course, but initially only dealt with economic issues, including the euro and EU cooperation issues.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany’s “sponsorship” of weak EU economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and the country’s complete exit from the EU.
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that occupied a niche of eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, ADG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 deputy seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" were given seats in the European Parliament.
A video with a journalist called the citizens of Ukraine "the nation of fools"

They believe in television and read very little.
As Drozdov pointed out, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been immunized with a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood,” the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Independent began to fight literature, which has the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the importation of as many as 201 editions.

Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has announced that it is accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
Armored apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the theme of the apocalypse, money is made not only by video game producers, film studios and book publishers.
Automobile companies are now building a new niche for themselves.

The Death Term of the Universe
The universe still exists for about 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study by an international team of scientists is published in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is intended for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The researchers came to this conclusion by observing the HSC (Hyper Supprime-Cam) of the Subaru telescope over about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the mass energy of the observed world, the scientists, working within the standard cosmological model LCDM (L Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
In a press release from the Subaru Observatory, it was noted that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the recording of data from the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the limitations imposed on the parameters of LCDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments in favor of the fact that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Bang.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum has failed
The opportunity to find out the opinion of the people on pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
In Moscow on Saturday, the general federal initiative group held a referendum against raising the retirement age.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered different formulations of questions (a total of five formulations were registered by the Central Election Board).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favor of the fact that the age established by the legislation on pensions as of July 1, 2018, upon the achievement of which Russian citizens are entitled to the appointment of a retirement pension, does not increase?"
This wording was registered by the Volgograd subgroup, the representatives of which did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and most legally viable.
The majority of the meeting consisted of supporters of Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and KPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told "Vedomostost" that the invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Volgograd subgroup (her wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive the invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who was a friend and who was an enemy."

That’s why there was such a decision,” the club’s press service quoted Bilyaletdinov as saying.

In the match "Loko" - "Ahmat" the mistakes of Turbine collapsed, as from the horn of abundance
Former All-Union category judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Yevgeny Turbine in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and disassembled the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate the judgeship of Evgeny Turbine in the match "Locomotive" - "Ahmat"?
"I believe that this referee has confirmed his ineptitude for the judgement of matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressures in the meeting of the fifth round of Spartak - Dynamo, neither Turbine himself, nor the heads of the DSI did not make any serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down to say in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private omissions of rough tricks fell out of the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute of the railwayman Edera collapses with his hands in his penalty square defender "Ahmata" Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbine doesn't set penalties.
- How do you rate the episode with Ido, which was in the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
- I think there was a deliberate game by the hand of the defender in his penalty area.
Turbine was close to the moment, seeing this episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by Reserve Judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep, and the penalty was not set.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports fairness has turned out to be spoiled.
This was the same case when the judgement of concepts displaced and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute Turbin did not decide to remove the defender of guests Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Kryhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Were we supposed to show the second mustard?
- At this point Turbine and the first yellow card showed not quite the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of judgement that some teams are penalized for such violations, as in the episode with Idova, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
- Seeing what you mean by double standards.
There were penalties.
They didn't give him.
So the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee watches who plays.
Here played on Saturday "Lokomotiv" and "Ahmata" has serious claims to the work of Turbine, because the team was harmed.
Matt Damon played the rape accused Judge Cavanaugh at the start of the SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the US Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate previously drew attention to his emotionality and detail of his stories during an interview with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly confessed to his love of beer, but has never been drunk before.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments were also won by Damon.
I was just pretending I drank a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone is familiar with it,” said the judge executing Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh has previously been elected Supreme Court Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand Finds Strange Behavior in Her Cloned Dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand has said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
"They're not the same.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it’s impossible to clone a soul,” the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog, a cotton de tullear named Samantha, who had to fall asleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that Chihuahua dogs nicknamed Miracle Milly, the world’s smallest dog, were cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniaturized.
The U.S. is considering a naval blockade of Russia due to oil and gas supplies
The U.S. may start a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The U.S. authorities have been so eager to fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s main suppliers of energy.
About the possibility of a naval blockade on the previous day, the head of the U.S. Interior Ministry, Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to global practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police but civilian functions, including implementing natural resources policy.
Therefore, Zinke's statement fell entirely within the competence of the department he headed, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the U.S. Navy, they control maritime routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinke said the need may be due to Washington’s desire to hinder Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives a lion’s share of its revenues from the supply of oil and gas to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main reason for Moscow’s revitalization in the region, Zinke said.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure its leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
For this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

Serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by the General Director of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute Zhukovsky Kirill Sypalo.

He said this on CNN.
He said that he can only confirm the words of the Washington Post columnist that the result of Putin’s aggression against Ukraine was the unification of Ukrainians.
“In 2013, transatlantic integration of Ukraine, NATO accession was supported by 16% of Ukrainians.
It is now more than 54%.
Who did that?
Putin.
In 2013, the European integration of Ukraine, the accession to the EU was supported by 33% of Ukrainians.
It's 74% now.
Who did that?
Putin," Poroshenko said.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more willing to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire," the President of Ukraine stressed.

Formula 1 Grand Prix of Russia
There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former captain of Chelsea and England John Terry - about why he attended the game of the ninth round of the Russian championship Spartak - Rostov (0:1).
“I have a club in Russia that I follow.
I’ve been watching it recently and it was interesting to see it from the outside.
“I can’t say I’m a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus and once again I want to apologize for the decision,” Terry said.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to third place in the tournament table, and "Spartacus" placed on the fifth line, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and white on October 7 will play with "Yenisei", and the trustees Valeria Karpina the day before will take "Orenburg".
Expensive violin handed over to a lobster for an invaluable price
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan in Somerville, Massachusetts, a worker offered only $50 for an old and unpresentable instrument.
But the experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and turned to the expert for advice.
It turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250,000 dollars.
Only the loops to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin had not long ago been stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin came to the person who handed it over to the barn, but there are no previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now everyone bringing the violin to the lombard will be asked to play on it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL we are waiting for an exciting confrontation: Spartak will host at its stadium in Tushin Rostov under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as we know, who is not a foreign "people's team".
The special spice of this meeting is given by the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15, and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, lagging behind the far-flung "Zenita" and being in one point from "Krasnodar", who plays with "Dynamo".
The red and white now have a difficult track: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, the team of Massimo Carrera suddenly flew in "Rapid", and recently gave up the home "Ahmata".
After the derby with the CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak won the Black Sea Cup with a minimum score and not without difficulty, and it is too early to talk about whether Russia's most popular club is approaching the exit from the crisis.
Rostov has not been able to win three games in a row, but has not been able to lose five games.
Let’s see if Karpin manages to extend the winning series with such a fundamental match for himself.
The previous meeting of Karpinsky Rostov with Spartak ended in favor of the capital team.
Starts at 7:00.
Indonesia is shaken by aftershocks after a powerful tsunami
In Indonesia, where an earthquake occurred a few days ago, which provoked a three-meter tsunami, meteorologists are observing more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnitude was 7.4, mainly affecting the island of Sulawesi, reports TV channel "Russia 24".
The number of deaths exceeded 420 people, and more than five hundred were injured.
The authorities notified the population of the threat of a tsunami in advance, but later cancelled it.

The fate of dozens more residents who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday on one of the waterfronts of the city of Palu, which was the most devastated after the earthquake, is still unknown.
London blasted with accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at a congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threats are growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, the enemies are acting in grey areas with the help of cyber attacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the largest of them is Russia, which is expanding its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have been repeatedly refuted by Moscow, TASS reports.
At the same time, British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said that Russia will have to pay a high price if it does not comply with international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year, former GRU Colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of espionage in favor of Britain, and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO is held, subject to the change of the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece over the country's name, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a fervent supporter of the renaming of the republic in North Macedonia.
International organizations are watching the preparations for the referendum and today’s vote.
Jan Petersen, head of the observation mission of the Bureau of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
Approximately 100 teams traveled across the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then counting votes and drafting protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparation for the vote, the work of the media, compliance with the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of a referendum.
Faye Dulgery: “Around 500 foreign observers are watching the vote closely.
The observer groups record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the electoral commissions to then set them out in the final report.
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a large role for mutual understanding.
On International Translator’s Day, September 30, the professional synchronized translator Barbel Sachse told about this.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
“The Germans like to plan events quietly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, “shut up for a long time, to go fast.”
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of the translator, this does not play a significant role," the specialist said in the commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know the history".
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany makes no sense to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny,” she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to "build relations" with Russia and support them.
According to her, for Berlin mania is especially important the project of the gas pipeline "Nord Stream - 2", which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

This result allowed an uncomplicated picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in the lead roles to head the U.S. box office for September 28-30.
In the international market, the film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, has raised $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Lee, which is remarkable, quite noticeably ahead of another newcomer of the Western rental - the cartoon "Smallfoot", a curious story of acquaintance of a charming yet with a representative of the human race, in whose existence the main character never believed.
A project by directors Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reissig for their start-up weekend raised $23 million, in general fulfilling the expectations of experts who predicted the tape 20-25 million over the weekend.
As for Smallfoot's total fees, they are currently $38.6 million (with it debuted in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active here, replenishing the film's treasury with 3.6 million.
Three of the strongest this time closed the children's fairy tale "Mystery of the House with the Clock" from the horror master Eli Roth, finally proving that the director knows how to make high-quality movies for the audience 12+.

In his first weekend of the famous installer (and with the recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who previously worked on a number of major horror projects, including "Happy Death Day", to which Hellfest places are very similar, earned in the US $5.1 million.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh were "Insanely Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), who do not seem to think to fall out of the top 10 of the American box office: a romantic comedy, living on screens for the seventh week, at the end of September is the sixth in the ranking of the most box office tapes, and the sixth in the ranking of the most tapes.
It is this amount that the painting has earned at the moment in the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.

Valery Belov: God helped "Siberia" today
Head coach "Vitaya" Valery Belov - about the defeat from "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular KHL championship.
"The colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to celebrate our fans," Belov said on the official website of Vityazya.
"I hope they will also support because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, God probably helped Siberia today, because they made a very gross mistake, especially our leaders.
In general, the micro-match lost 0:3 to our leading leaders, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, although there were moments.
But I'm still going to take the blame.
Because, apparently, we missed something in preparation.
Compared to last game, it was a different team.”
"It's an awful mess."
Spectators are outraged by Agutin's choice for the "Voice" show
Spectators of the show "Voice 60+" accuse mentor Leonid Agutin of "disgraceful cumming and obnoxious deception".
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But the sonly feelings took over, and he chose a relative in his team.
At that time, many thought it a joke, but pardoned the unobjectiveness of the mentor in the first stage.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the father of the star completely unjustly took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the viewers are no longer ready to forgive Agutina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the ugly and frank dragging of our close relatives to the final ladder.
I had already doubted that Agutina would have enough strength and conscience not to drag her father to the end at all to the first place," Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program "Man from TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "slew" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by the fact that viewers still want to see his father's show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case, the viewers want an objective evaluation and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the "Voice" from Agutin's team - they were doomed."
“Last time Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he was supposed to be a professional.”
“The contest has lost its meaning.”
"To remove from the project two talented people and leave in the project your dad who does not sing a whisper, how can you then call a mentor?"
"He likes how his dad sings, give him a concert in the Kremlin for his money and see how many people come to this concert."
It's the Voice show, not the Cool Relatives show.
"It was unprofessional on the part of Agutina."
"Then you have to offer to perform on your own show to dad, not on a show that is done for the money of Channel One."
“It was a real opportunity for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don’t understand why a silent dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre cast, and Pope Agutin brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on the stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
“Because I don’t want to go through the mess!”
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
Around the swamps and clumsiness.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theatre of absurdity continues!”
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" at blind auditions came the son of Gradsky.
Then the meter and the head did not come to take the son in his own team.
What's more, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear."
Agutin could not act as a professional.

The head of the Institute of Space Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Anatoly Petroukovich, a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences, told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian astronauts on the Moon.

He noted that one of the options is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, which would avoid interference from which the Earth is the source.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study cosmic sources of radio radiation," Petroukovich added.

This could help determine how life appears on planets.
Earlier, the head of the Roscosmos Corporation said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation can carry out a manned flight to the Moon by 2030.
An offended customer threw out a basket of feces in the store 7-Eleven
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), who allegedly "had a tooth" on the manager of the 24/7 store of the 7-Eleven network: in May, he was exposed from the store for inappropriate behavior.
And decided to avenge his enemy in an original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went to the store and threw the contents of the basket on the floor and on some of the goods on the shelves.
In the basket were feces and urine, which Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile biotoilet.
The policemen who arrived at the scene arrested the “vengeance”.
He was imprisoned and released on bail of $300.
He was charged with illegal intrusion into someone else's property and criminal offences, and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms's crime looks ridiculous rather than serious, the court sentence may be harsh enough, as he has repeatedly violated the law before: he is followed by theft on a large scale, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving a car in a sober state and cruel.

Russian pilot "Williams" Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the race Grand Prix of Russia.
“To be honest, I don’t really want to talk about what’s in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn I found myself between two cars that immediately pressed me.
I lost all the positions that I lost at the start, moment, instantly.
He turned out to be in a very bad position.
I'm stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the rest of us got to the pit stop, we'd get into the "clean air" and the pace would come back, but the rubber was gone.
Plus I fought with my partner, he had contact with him too.
I understand he was a little wrong.

Tarpisev called absurd the removal of Glushakov and Yeshenko from the basis of "Spartak"
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the removal of the players of the Moscow Spartak Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eschenko from trainings with the main team after liking the criticism of the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera.
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
Paying attention to such things is non-worldly nonsense.
I don’t agree with what Carrero is doing.
It only deepens the discord in the team.
First of all, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to get laid.
If Glushakov and Yeshchenko put likes, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And that doesn’t serve a normal climate in the team.
Spartacus doesn’t have a game today, so it didn’t have to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
"Spartacus" a lot is not in order in different lines, there is unplayability after the introduction of the youth.
The relationship within the team, it seems, does not add optimism before this match", - I am sure Tarpishchev.
The game between the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
Former Spartacus coach John Terry headed the Chelsea youth team.
Students of "Sirius" discussed with scientists nature-like technologies
Students of the Sirius educational center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The speaker took place within the framework of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Environmental Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the website of the educational center reported on September 29.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film "Kody Kurchatov", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, Mikhail Kovalchuk, a correspondent of the National Academy of Sciences, spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist published on the website "Sirius".
Students have learned that modern technology requires a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help nature-like technologies, on which today young scientists are working.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, and also talked about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
“The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a tremendous benefit.
This is the explosive growth of medical technology, it is the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's another side.
The development of nature-like technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of living nature systems.
There is a reverse side - a purposeful intervention in the life of a person.
There are always risks.
A car appeared - people began to die under the wheels.
Cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I am creating medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction," - quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-nature-like technologies of the NIC "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Diakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-technology Vyacheslav Demin.

Macedonia: Referendum not held due to low attendance

Kemerovchan upset rams herd in cemetery
On September 30, on the famous Kemerovo page in the social network appeared a message from an eyewitness that at one of the local cemeteries freely roaming cattle.
The animals walked between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the locals noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in the cleaning of the territory from weeds and grasses, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not come to the behavior of animals:
"It's a grave, not a pasture.
I have nothing to do there.
Of course, you will not say about the rams that they mumble, but still it is not the case." (style preserved) - noted in her message an outraged Kemerovo woman.
Either way, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
Push and hit - how right?
There are no words to pressure.
That's right, enough.
The word “squeeze” in the meaning of “tighten, influence, influence” exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word “feel”.
We use this word, assuming it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "to meet" are not only etymologically not close, but even in some sense opposite.
Check it out for yourself.
To prolong (e.g., book, obsolete) means “enough, full, enough, to be enough for someone or something to satisfy”.
Pleasure, pleasure are related words.
He used to mean "not to depend on anything, to have a self-satisfying meaning" - "to satisfy yourself".
Old Slavic "dovl<0xC5><0xA3>ti" is related to the words "rule" and "will".
To suffocate, to suppress, is completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (squealing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaid<0xC4><0xAB> - "to oppress".
The similar phonetic form of the words "pressure" and "to meet", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
Thus, we have this very "d[a]influence", which is also used in the letter through "a", which is, well, incorrect and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
Well, that's right, enough.
But this word is obsolete, in its proper meaning is no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people are having a negative impact on you from above, use the word “press”.
You can also use the "pressure-exerting" design, but remember that this is a stationery.

Miracles are happening in our lives!
One of them was reported on Twitter by German journalist Christy Dietz.
She wrote on her page that her four-year-old son parked his bike (a child's bicycle without pedals) around the same lamppost throughout the year.
And one morning there was a cute sticker on the pillar with a photo of a green bike and the inscription: "Only for him."
There was no limit to the delight of the mother and child.
Christy thanked the anonymous benevolent and praised him for an interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet quickly spread across the social network and made a lot of people smile.
The comments to him were also remarkable:
"How wonderful it is!"
"Thank you for the wonderful communication in this world."
"I think there are a lot of people in the world who can do that."
"Unfortunately, they don't attract the same attention as the villains."
“This is the world we need!”
Readers asked the journalist, if suddenly she was able to find out who was the author of the idea, to tell about it.
After all, this man, apparently, somewhere nearby: he repeatedly watched as the child parked, once it came to his mind.
It really deserves a place in Formula 1.

It will be interesting to watch his performances next year,” Aleshina quotes SMP Racing.

Russian officers demanded a debt from a dead old woman
In Kurgan, court officers required a long-dead woman to pay a state fee of 200 rubles.
This is reported by the Ural Meridian.
In mid-September, the relatives of the late Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan Division of Judicial Officers, stating that an executive proceeding had been initiated against the 105-year-old woman.

Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations have sent an open letter to the Minister demanding his resignation.
With the help of an operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists.
In three years of the Russian military operation in Syria about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 terrorists destroyed the Air and Space Force of the Russian Federation.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former head of the VKS, the head of the Committee of the Federation Council on Defense and Security, Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of airborne weapons: the Air and Space Forces applied and continue to apply all strikes precisely on the objects of the terrorists.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria in three years - we are talking, for example, about ammunition warehouses, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of the jihadists was hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the promotion of the government forces of Syria, reports Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jebhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of ISIS fought about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries.
And we are talking only about registered persons, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter the territory of our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at long-range - otherwise this evil "would have flown to us".

Syria Accuses US of Supporting Terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem has accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, it has committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
“These murders under international law are war crimes,” he said.
Muallem said the U.S. and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists” because the targets of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “sowing chaos, death and destruction on their way.”
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clean Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for the Reconciliation of the Enemy Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with prohibited phosphorus ammunition.
The U.S. has denied all charges.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
This was stated by the head of state during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance by Hungary of its passports in Transcarpathia.
In defending Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, as president, he will protect Ukrainian citizens, wherever they are - in the east or west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the foreign ministry's position in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is the intention to expel the country's consul from the coast.
“I fully share every letter that is said to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” the President said.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in the consulate of Hungary in the coast.
At the same time, they swore an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavel Klimkin noted that the consul of Hungary, who appears on the video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It has also become known that the Prosecutor’s Office of the Transcarpathian Region has initiated a criminal case on the issue of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified under the article "State Treason".
Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he participated in the work of the Council of CIS States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
The data on flights of the Russian "board No. 1" on the website Flightradar indicate that about 6 p.m., Tajik time on September 28, IL-96-300 departed from Dushanbe airport and took a course to the north-east.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the aircraft's transponder was turned off.
The direction of his flight indicates that the aircraft could have flown to Khakassia.
According to the agency "Baikal24", the president in Abakan on the night of September 29, met in person the head of the region Victor Zimin.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the sources of the site believe that the real reason is "the problem of the second round".
The second round of elections of the head of the region will be held in Khakassia next Sunday.
It was attended by Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the acting head of the republic Viktor Zimin ("United Russia").
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour together with Konovalov will take part Andrei Filyagin ("Fair Russia").
The Khakasian media suggest that Putin can accept the resignation of the head of Khakasia and appoint a new vice president of the republic, as well as make a decision about the fate of Zimin.
Putin had already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite places to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, military action is nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syria’s Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said: “The situation on the ground is now more stable and safe thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life and means of subsistence more difficult for people.
The Syrian authorities also urged the international community to promote and allocate funds for the return of refugees.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.
Volkswagen fully admitted its guilt in the Dieselgeet in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The losses of the group are estimated at least 25 billion euros.
This amount does not include only penalties and compensation.
By June of next year, the automaker is obliged to buy or repair 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company’s management said that commitments have already been fulfilled for 83% of cars, so the program will be completed early.
Volkswagen is trying to compensate for the losses and regain the trust of the customers.
Thus, the management of the group has recently been changed again, and large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have also been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: such a right the authorities received in February of this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
Metropolitan Hilarion, head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
"It is the same as in fascist Germany to pin a yellow star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," - said the metropolitan in the broadcast of the TV channel "Russia-24" (quote)
According to him, this move will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in the acute stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to gain full control of the UOC and "put it out of law", believes the priest.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter assumes the rename of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Vice-Chairman of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Metropolitan Vladimir, the deputy of the Holy Assumption Pochaevskaya Lavra, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the site of the abbey.
At different times in history, our predecessors and those of faith and spirit, Christians had to profess their faith and defend their sanctuaries.
Given the situation that has arisen, and based on the information we have and on the threats of massacres that are spreading, it is clear that we too will have to endure something,” the metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The vice-president of the laurel also stressed that it is likely that "your physical presence will be needed".
The clergyman added: "Lenin's grandchildren - by spirit, they threaten execution, and therefore we will protect our sanctuary."
Whoever is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra – the Orthodox Ukrainian and world sanctuary – should be ready to protect it.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged that the believers not be deceived.
The UOC has the canonical status defined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 by the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to bring into dependence on the new-style patriarch and friend of the Roman Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has," the deputy laureate said.
He recalled that since October 1990 the UOC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has a tomos.
What else do we need a Tomos?” – noted Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaevsky, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether other denominations have a Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
Believers have to some extent understood and decided which temple they should go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and dissension again.
Some are jealous that the domes are shining on the temples that they want to destroy,” the priest emphasized.
Pochaevskaya Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurel is located on the top of the Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates to the beginning of the thirteenth century.
The club was evacuated after the bomb was reported.

Life still teaches me... and when I begin to understand people,” Buzova wrote.

“You haven’t suffered yet.
You cling to every word, live in a normal, normal family,” she wrote.

What do you need to do to avoid losing a victim?" - wrote <0x40>liashukgalina.

"Most of all, don't be upset.
Your man will not speak loud words to the whole country and then just not do them," Buzova said.
“You are a queen and you need a king, and the one who turned you into a paperwork is just not worthy of you.
Raise your nose and go on,” <0x40>kreszentia_f wrote.
Earlier, Nazarov explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and give up Buzova because the singer lacks sympathy for him.
He decided to donate all the money to charity.

"A good game was, interesting, although it went to the goal" - quotes Vorobyev official website "Automobilista".

Good luck will come if we continue to play in this direction.”

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia on Sunday, September 30, a referendum is held on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (VMRO-DPMNE) Christian Mickosky said that he will not vote in the referendum.
According to party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky, Mickosky decided to abstain from voting in order to express his disagreement with the treaty, which he considers "destructive".
According to the spokesperson, the current referendum resolves the question of renaming the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov refused to participate in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that the name for the country he chose 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. the Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.

U.S. Settles Growth in Opioid Production in Afghanistan
There was a lot of talk about the dramatic escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the authorities of the state and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks that killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” Patrushev said.
Afghanistan's troubles did not begin long ago.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the terrorist group "Al-Qaida" (prohibited in the Russian Federation) was declared the main enemy of the United States, which was planted in Afghanistan.
It wasn’t even a month ago that America and NATO allies launched the military operation “Indestructible Freedom” there.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of U.S. troops are still on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
U.S. troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
How can they buy back from the militants for money - only not to touch them.
The government of Afghanistan controls a small part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - in the "Taliban" movement (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia – exactly what they failed to achieve in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be okay with that.
In 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Colossal growth in areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to the change of the country’s name.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right to be called Macedonia as its northern neighbor, and considering the prostitution of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as such.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope for social change.
Greece has a right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises can not make absolutely everyone happy.”
For the renaming of the country, the ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and the president of the country George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, led by Zaev, is forced from abroad in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First and foremost, I will lose my sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole.
