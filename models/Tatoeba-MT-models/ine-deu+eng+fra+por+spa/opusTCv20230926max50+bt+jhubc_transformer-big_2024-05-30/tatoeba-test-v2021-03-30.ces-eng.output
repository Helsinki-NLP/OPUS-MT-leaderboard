He knows them.
They must be very proud of their daughter.
Tom turned to the right and Mary went to the other side.
There's one left.
He began to explain what had happened.
Tom's got a cast iron stomach, he can eat almost anything.
The mother did not know what to do with her son.
He knows wine.
Tom felt someone clapping on his shoulder.
Do you know who the parents are?
No words can express how amazing you are.
I'd like fruit juice.
Will it rain tomorrow?
The cuneiform font invented by the Sumerians was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I love summer, but I can't stand the heat.
Of course you do!
Mary loves you.
What would you like?
What does the tattoo mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found yourself a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before meals.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a high tip on the table.
He's not over a glass of beer after a whole day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
So far, I have been satisfied with my work.
You really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's the map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting, even though I was invited.
Hey, are you still here?
I thought you might be dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for your car.
Tom is obviously lying.
Right and then right and then right?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Tom says he wants to win.
Tom will be thirteen tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch him ruin his life.
Do everything with balance.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you must.
We climbed the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
That belt's too tight for me.
Playing the bassoon is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer here.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are rapidly disappearing today.
Tom's still busy.
You'd better leave now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I hate to bother you, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom shouting at the crowd?
He's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.

It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.
Cracks are falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like to wear a tie.
We weren't doing as well as we'd like.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you and Joana have a fight?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll be stuck here forever.
Tom's got a cliche.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you going to school by train?
Tom won't be at school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who will Tom visit?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary.
Why don't you invite me for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I won't be surprised if that happens.
He's free.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother about it.
Tom washed his feet carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was as happy as a flea when she got a recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you'd helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He visits his uncle.
Everybody's out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in a place like this?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.

If you have a problem, I want to know which one.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm completely happy alone.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we are still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There was a half-broken wall.
I spoke to him in English and found that I could make a deal.

Did you bring the book?
I dare not open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting a divorce from her.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
Who are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal and I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a bout of laughter.
Tom's wrong, right?
It's better to be dead than red to live.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he wants to say.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse is crouching.
I lent Tom a comb.
I'm bored.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not such a dick anymore.
