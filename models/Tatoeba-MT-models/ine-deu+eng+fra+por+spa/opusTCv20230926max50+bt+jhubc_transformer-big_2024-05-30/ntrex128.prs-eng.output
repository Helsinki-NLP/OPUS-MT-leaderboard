Members of Parliament in Wales are concerned that "they look like muppets."
There is dismay among members of the House about the proposal to change their name to MWPs.
This is due to plans to change the name of the House to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of Parliament across the political sphere are concerned that this may cause a mockery.
A member of the Labour Party's House of Representatives said his group was concerned that the term "could be used with Twpo Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Wales, twp means fool and pwp means stool.
A member of the House of Representatives from the bad party said he was "not happy" at all and suggested alternative terms.
The Conservative Party of Wales said its party had a "free opinion" about the change of name, but stressed that it was a short leap from the MWP to the mob.
In this sense, the Welsh letter w is similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter u.
The House Commission, which is currently preparing a draft law on name changes, said: “The final decision on any descriptor of what members of the House apply to is naturally an important matter for members themselves.”
The Welsh government's 2017 ruling gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that had widespread support for the adoption of a parliament called the Parliament of Wales.
As for the House nominee, the commission wanted the Welsh parliamentary nominee WMPs, but the MWP option had widespread support for public consultation.
Apparently, members of the House are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach a consensus is a headache for House Speaker Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit the bill of amendments within a few weeks.
The Act on Amendments includes other changes to the way the House works, including provisions on the disqualification of members of the House and the scheme of the committee system.
Members of the House will cast their final votes when discussing the law, on which titles to apply.
Macedonians are all in a query to change the country's name to the ballot boxes.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "North Macedonian Republic."
The general vote was planned after decades of attempts to resolve the conflict with the neighboring country of Greece, which has a unique province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor’s name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Giorgi Ivanov opposed the change of name, saying he did not want to vote.
However, supporters of all parties, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayu, argue that the change of name is only the cost of membership in the European Union and NATO.
With the efforts of the churches in Harlem, the bells of S.T. Martin are silenced.
"Historically, the old men I've spoken to say there were in every corner and next to a bar and church," Mr. Adams said.
“Today, there is none.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
He said that these days, “people become social in different ways.”
"Apartments are no longer the same living rooms that people go to on a regular basis."
Concerning churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
He added that the churches will be replaced by detached buildings with shared apartments so that people will live there who do not help with the remains of the churches.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, and therefore the arrival of a day when all these churches will be completely blocked will be accelerated, because it seems unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will move to these places," he said.
Both churches were built by white settlers of the church, before Harlem was transformed into a black metropolis – a metropolitan community in 1870, S.T. Martin a decade later.
White settlers left the original Methodist church in the 1930s.
A black settler who worshiped near the building was named after him.
S.T. Martin was stripped of power by a black settler to the presidency of John Howard Johnson, who led the retail strike on 125th Street, Harlem’s main retailer road; a person who opposed the hiring or promotion of blacks.
In 1939, a fire severely destroyed the building, but members of the local Johnson Father Church decided to rebuild the building, using Carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of his father and successor at S.T. Martin, proudly coined the term "the voice of the poor people."
The expert who called Carillon in July applied another term to it: "cultural treasure" and "instrument without historical counterparts".
Tiffany Angeli, an expert at the University of Michigan, said it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Linde, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mirwiter said that S.T. Martin would not be replaced.
What was played at S.T. Martin over the past few months was a complex tale of architects and contractors, some of whom were introduced by non-priestly church leaders and others by the Episcopal realm.
The church’s meeting room – the church’s governing body, which is made up of non-priestly leaders – in July overtook the territory with the concern that the church “would be after it to expand along the shores” not write to the church’s meeting room, even the meeting room of the church’s congressmen in the rental of architects and architects.
Some members of the church complained of lack of transparency in the area of the church.
A shark in California injured a 13-year-old boy during a dive for a labster.
Officials said on Saturday a shark injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving in a lagoon in California early in the season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Insinia.
Chad told KSWB television in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about nine o'clock in the morning on Saturday, when they suddenly heard a child screaming for help, they rushed with a group to him by diving to get him out.
The guardian stated that at first he thought it was just an excitement to catch a labster, but later he "realized that the child was yelling, "I was baited!
I've been baited!"
All the crowbars had been opened," Hamil said, suddenly noticing that he had taken the child.
"I yelled at everyone to pull themselves out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'
The boy was taken to Radio Children's Hospital in San Diego and placed on the list of ill-treatment.
The nature of the attacking shark was not known.
Captain Larry Gillis told a news conference that a shark had been at the site a few weeks ago, but it did not appear to be a dangerous shark fish.
Gillis added that the victim had survived from the injuries inflicted on the upper half of the torso.
The authorities blocked the entrance to the beach from the coast of Ponto in Casablad to Swami in Sicinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Gillis stated that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Cincinnati wants to pressure the UK cosmetics market.
Cincinnati is competing with Boots, Superdrug and DiBenhames by creating interior corridors for cosmetics stores run by leading specialist colleagues.
As part of a <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion strong push into the UK cosmetics market, which is growing in the face of a decline in home cosmetics sales, more cosmetics corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and in the face of this will be successfully tested.
Investing in cosmetics is done in a situation where supermarkets are in the process of using the store front footers that were once used for television, microwaves, and household items.
Cinsburys said it doubled the amount of its cosmetics for the first time by offering 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and PawPaw.
The existing rows of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also occupy a lot of space in parallel with branded sections similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket continues to reactivate the small shop line design, so most products for vegetarians – comfort – are items that are increasingly in demand by newcomer retailers.
In addition, fragrance retailers are testing the ratings at two Cincinnati stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, while the second in Clyde Oak, Brimington, will open later this year.
Buying online and switching to buying small amounts of food from local stores on a daily basis means that supermarkets need to spend more effort to convince people to buy from them.
Cincinnati CEO Mike Cope has said that stores will increasingly look like government stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete against discounters such as Aldi and Lidl by providing more, food-free services.
Cincinnati has been placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores and since buying both chains two years ago, it has introduced a number of habitats that, according to it, have increased carpet sales and made the business more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renovate the cosmetics and spices sectors failed.
Cinsburys attempted a joint estimate deal with Bots in the early 2000s, but after a controversy over how to split capital from chemical stores in their supermarkets, their partnership ended.
The new strategy came three years after Cincinnati sold 281 spices to Silicio, the owner of Lloyd’s spice stores, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
He said Lloyds was playing a role in the plan by adding an extended range of facial care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Cisco, said: “We’ve changed our view and feel about cosmetic corridors to make the environment better for our customers.
We have also invested above our special trainee counterparts, who are available to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all the needs and attractive environments, and comfortable locations mean that we are now the convincing destination for cosmetics that challenge old selling methods."
"Disturbance" by Peter Jones after Holly Willowbay's exit from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peterjans star Dragos Dan has been "disturbed" after the departure of Holly Willowbee, the TV presenter, from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million trade in home appliances brand to focus on contracts with Marx, Spencer and TV I.
Violofbai has no time for the brand of clothing and trolley home accessories.
The business of the two partners was similar to the Gup Gwinnett Paltero brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old announced on Instagram that he was leaving.
With his exit from the lucrative last-minute lifestyle brand – focusing on his big contracts with Marx and Spencer and TV I, Peter Johns has made the star of Dragos Dan extremely angry.
Sources say that when the TV’s golden girl held a tension meeting on Tuesday at the head office of her trading firm in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire admitted that her new deal – worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – was worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meaning she didn’t have enough time to get to the brand.
The business is similar to Gup Gwinnett Paltero, which has doubled the estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willowbee 37 announced his departure from Trolley on Instagram, Jones hurriedly left the UK to spend the holidays at one of his homes.
A source said: "Trowley has been one of Halley's top priorities so far.
This is probably a long-term future for him, which he will expect in the next few decades.
His decision to leave has made all the people who have worked with him completely depressing.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was about to begin.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlo’s headquarters that are ready for sale.
Experts believe that this morning’s departure of the scammer, the person who is among the most capital-gathering stars in the UK, is due to its huge investment in products ranging from candles and candles to clothing and homeware worth millions of dollars to the company, and has been delayed further in its launch.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Violofbay, the mother of her three children, and her husband, Don Baldwin, had a close relationship with Johns and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
In 2016, Villovbay founded the company with the Cup, and the 52-year-old joined in March.
The couple went on holiday together, and Johns holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin TV.
Willowbee is about to become M&S brand representative and take the place of Mr. McPharlin as host on my show I'm a celebrity on TV I.
A source close to Johns said last night, “We will not comment on his commercial affairs.”
We talked about "and then we fell in love."
He joked about the media's criticism of what some might think was "inappropriate to the presidency" and his positive views on North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump make such a fuss?
Trump, in his mockery, voiced the "newsman."
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He said Kim showed interest in the second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, which was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear denuclearisation negotiations have come to a halt.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's high-ranking diplomat Ray Yang-hoe told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was "reciprocally reacting" to the U.S.'s unprecedented ruthless actions against North Korea.
Instead, he said, the United States continues to impose sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump had a lot of optimism in his speech.
He said: “We are doing very well with North Korea.
“If we were fighting with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, ended rocket tests, helped rescue hostages, and allowed U.S. crew members to return home.
And he defended his unusual approach in conversations related to relations with Kim.
"Being president is very simple, but instead of 10,000 people trying to enter the closed field outside, we're going to deploy about 200 people there," Trump said, referring directly to the crowd in front of him.
Earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island and killed hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they didn’t need them.
However, more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, a state of national crisis that has not been declared as a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in most cases, they have been too clear about not needing international aid, this is a bit of a challenge," Sambang said.
While the Child Protection Institute is organizing a team to travel to Palo, there is no certainty as to whether foreign workers will be able to work in the area.
Sotopo, a spokesman for the National Crisis Administration, said Indonesian officials were investigating the situation in Palau to allow international agencies to cooperate in aid efforts.
Considering the earthquakes that are occurring in Indonesia on a regular basis, unfortunately, the country is not prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters are built in Ache, the area has no common sight on the other side of the coastline.
Although there was a warning, apparently the absence of a fire alarm in Palo was likely the cause of the loss.
At the most appropriate times, travel between Indonesia and some of its islands is challenging.
Natural crises make the provision of logistical services more complex.
A mobile hospital on board a ship based in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the move to Sob Palau, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo placed the reconstruction of the lost infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and spent the budget on roads and railroads.
But the budget deficit has disrupted Mr. Joko’s administration, even though he is set to run for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko continues to face pressures from ongoing sectarian differences in Indonesia, with the majority of Muslim followers following traditional readings of the doctrine.
In the aftermath of attacks by Christian and Muslim groups on the roads, more than 1,000 people were killed using satires, bows and other light weapons, and tens of thousands more were displaced from their homes.
See also: Daniel Sturgeon scored an equaliser against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturgeon saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League with a score in the 89th minute.
Sturgeon, when he was 30 yards behind Chelsea with his team, received a 0-1 pass from Shakira.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting the goal.
With this attack, the ball was thrown higher than the penalty area, and then shifted its course to the right and to the top of the field.
Eventually, the ball fell on top of Cape Arisabala, which was looking up, and then entered the net.
"It was just an attempt to get the ball in that position, and players like Ruck always went as far forward as possible, so I just tried to spend as much as I could on the initiative," Sturgeon told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant coming, and he only made a phone call before he thought too much about it."
Chelsea scored the first 0-1 in the half-time after scoring a point in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eidin Thousand.
In the process, the blue-coated striker passed the ball back to Matthew Cossack before he quickly entered Liverpool near the middle of the field and halfway through the playground.
Kusak grabbed it and ran towards the middle of the square.
Then he threw the ball directly, causing the thousand to enter the penalty area.
He overtook the defense and threw the ball into the vertical shot of a trick with a left leg while Alison Baker passed Liverpool behind.
On Wednesday, at 3 p.m. at the Stade San Paolo in Naples, Italy, Liverpool will take part in the group stage of the Champions League against Naples.
On Thursday at 3 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League, Chelsea will play with Videoton.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
According to the Crisis Office on Sunday morning, casualties from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have increased to 832 tons.
A large number of people were reportedly trapped under the wreckage of derelict buildings due to the 7.5-magnitude quake that occurred Friday and the waves had spread to 20 feet, the office's spokesman Sutopo Poro Noguru said at a news conference.
The city of Palo, which has a population of 380,000, is scattered with the remains of destroyed buildings.
After a woman was killed by a knife, the police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
This morning, after the body of a woman was discovered in Brindisi, an investigation into the murder began.
A 44-year-old woman's body was found wounded by a knife at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Road, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked the people of the area to testify to what they have seen or heard.
"The investigation is in its early stages, and I ask all the people who were near John's Road in Brindisi and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I will continue to contact us, especially taxi drivers who may have captured images by the Dash camera, as they probably have information that is very important in our research.
A police spokesperson admitted that the woman whose body was found was from the people of Bricine and was found inside a building.
After the fourteenth day, some who call themselves friends of the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about the location she had found this morning.
According to police statements that they are informing the nearby villages of the victim, the investigation is ongoing.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was returning to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter and leave the building.
When he was confronted with what had happened, he remained silent.
Residents of the building were told it would take hours for them to be allowed to enter.
A police officer who was talking to a man was heard saying that the whole area was considered to be the scene of the accident.
There was another woman with tears in her eyes.
He said, “It’s terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police motorcycles stopped one inside the seat belt and the other outside.
A number of officers stood inside the security belt and monitored the blocks of apartments.
All those with information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or call Crimestoppers on 111 555 0800 without disclosing their identity by calling 247 September 30th.
Tennessee Cromwell is the last memorial in Parliament to be targeted for the turmoil of "rewriting history."
His exile would be a fair punishment in exchange for the Taliban’s destruction of the cultural and religious goods of the UK, carried out by his fanatic and fundamentalist followers.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “perplexing” and “trying to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the ongoing debate over the disappearance of the Tendances, it was inconceivable that perhaps one day the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside West Minster Palace.
Cromwell has not commanded or done it to break the idol of the British Civil Wars.
In fact, Cromwell’s mistake is that he was a victim of his predecessors’ actions because Thomas was in the last century.
The glorious portrayal of Sir William Hammo Tornikov from Cramol testifies to the views of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a personality that most believe is worthy of acclaim.
Mr. Goldsmith told Sandy Telegraph: "Cramulus may have been known in the late 19th century compared to today, in the eyes of many as a defender of parliament against foreign pressure; and in his era, of course, the king.
Whether this representation is fully valid or not is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
The important thing is that the mid-17th century war marked the subsequent developments of our nation, and Cromwell is a uniquely recognizable figure, one of whose side represents the difference.
His achievements as a protector of God are also worthy of praise and esteem.
The Pig Killed a Chinese Farmer.
According to a local media report, a farmer in southwest China was attacked and killed by pigs.
South China Morning News reported on Sunday that the body of the man, who was identified by his exoneration, was found near a tavern in Marquet Liopanchio in the state of Goizhou while he was bleeding severely and was drowning in blood.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer in Sining County, China, prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs in a swine herd.
It is reported that he and his son Coca-Cola, from the neighboring Greek state, came to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his uncle's son encountered his dead body and noticed an open door in the hallway.
He said there was a big pig in the closet while his mouth was blood-stained.
According to the report, a medical trial confirmed that a pig weighing <0xC2><0xA3>550 had torn the farmer’s man apart and killed him.
Sham Guoyang's news agency quoted the man's uncle's son, who expelled Wu, as saying that "the feet of the son of Coca-Cola were blood-stained and shattered."
The security camera footage shows Yan’s arrival at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning as she entered the market to feed her pigs.
His body was discovered an hour later.
The animal that killed this man does not belong to him or his uncle’s son.
Markit’s manager told the dinner news agency that while the police were gathering evidence on the scene, pigs were surrounded further away to prevent the animal from attacking other people.
It is reported that Yan's family and Markit's officials are negotiating a cash compensation in exchange for his death.
Although such incidents are rare, before this, the events of swine attacks on humans have also been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a <0xC2><0xA3>650 pig pushed a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife frightened the animal to flee.
After an Oregon farmer was baited by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not generally attacking but that the taste of blood acts like a “mast.”
“They’re just for fun.
They’re kids, they’re very curious... they’re not looking to hurt you.
You have to respect them proportionately,” he added.
The effects of the sea storms will cause widespread and severe rainfall in the southwestern regions of the United States.
Based on weather forecasts, the Rosa marine winds have weakened due to the cold waters flowing towards the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, it will be raining heavily throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. on Saturday East Time, Rosa had winds of 85 miles per hour, and in Categorie 1 there was a seastorm, and it was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
At the same time, a mid-wave in the Pacific began to form and will flow eastward towards the west coast of the United States. Monday, as the days approach the Baja California Peninsula, the hurricane will exacerbate the pressure of your tropical moisture.
On Monday, it will rain 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Then, over the next few days, tropical moisture, which is interconnected with the approaching wave, will form a large and intense rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause hazardous floods, flooding, and landslides in the deserts.
Extreme tropical humidity causes rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in some locations, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that about 2 to 4 inches of rain will fall in parts of the southwest, especially most areas of Arizona.
It is possible that, due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall, rapidly worsening conditions occur at the same time as flooding.
Walking out into the desert without caution in a situation where there is a risk of tropical rain would be highly inappropriate.
Heavy rains will turn valley waters into turbulent seas and thunderstorms will create local thunderstorms and fogs.
Among the approaching waves, heavy local rain will bring in some areas of the southern California coast.
Overall, there is a possibility of rainfall of more than half an inch, which can cause dirt and dirt to flow and roads to become dirty.
This will be the first rainy season in the area.
At the end of Sunday and the first Monday before the rain spreads at the end of Monday and Tuesday, some scattered tropical storms begin to approach Arizona.
There will be heavy rain on the four corners on Tuesday and it will continue until Wednesday.
October will see severe temperature fluctuations in the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder but tropical regions will remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to sudden changes in temperature over a short period of time.
On Sunday, a prominent example of sudden differences in temperatures across the central U.S. will occur.
There is a nearly 20-degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska and S.T. Lewis and Des Moines, VA.
In the next few days, the current summer heat will begin to rise again.
Most of the central and eastern regions of the United States are expected to witness the onset of heat with a range of 80 from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City will hit 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is roughly 10 degrees above average.
Throughout the first half of October in the east of the United States, our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of high temperatures than its average.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Bert Kavanaugh's trial.
On Thursday, more than 20 million testimonies of the influential Bert Kavanaugh and a woman were seen in a high court accusing him of sexual harassment that apparently occurred in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political shutdown continued with Friday's regular program shutdown with a sudden change in the situation at the last minute: a draft of an agreement by Arizona Sean. Jeff Flake was presented to the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was in love with him drunkenly, trying to strip off his clothes at a party at a great barn.
In her emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said she was 100 percent sure that the incident did not happen.
Nilsen reported that more than 20.4 million people were likely to have seen it on Friday.
The company calculates the average observation statistics through CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC channels.
Statistics from other networks, including PBS, CPAN, and the Fox Business Network that displayed it, were not available.
And Nilsen usually has trouble statizing the people he sees in offices.
Assuming, this is similar to the number of attendees in a final game of football or in an academic award-winning arena.
Nilsson said the Fox News channel, which analysts strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, had been a frontrunner with an average of 5.69 million viewers over the course of the day.
The BBC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was a lot of interest after the meeting.
In the event of Friday, Felix was the central character.
After the Republican Central Office issued a statement saying it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was hunted down by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he walked into the left to attend a judicial committee meeting and protesters shouted at him.
He had stood for a few minutes and lowered his eyes from being severely influenced by CNN's guilt and live broadcast.
One woman shouted, “I’m standing right here in front of you.”
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the people?
She was told, “You have power, but most women have no power.”
Flick said his office had issued a statement and added that he would have more to say at the committee meeting before the left was closed.
Hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted for Kavanaugh's nomination to raise the vote criteria to the level of a majority in the Senate, cable and television networks covered it live.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI will address the accusations against the candidate next week, which is also insisted by a minority of Democrats.
Flick was relatively convinced by the speeches of his friend Sine. Chris Cones of the Democratic Party.
After speaking with Cones and later with a number of other senators, Flick made the decision.
Flick's choice was powerful because it was clear that Republicans had no right to vote to confirm Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Cavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of Brexit of 'playing with politics'
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the EU of "playing politics" and the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will be attending the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018 for a briefing.
In another interview with the newspaper, former US Secretary of State Boris Johnson cited his so-called Brexit plan, saying that a proposal on the basis of which Britain and the European Union should collect tariffs on each other is "very unfair."
Wild Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Ditvin Simpson on Suspicion of Murder of LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shooting of Weid Sims on suspicion of killing a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said the 20-year-old was arrested on second-degree murder charges.
Officials have released a video of a dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims has lost his elbow during the war.
The FBI affiliate reported to the CBS that the police found the glasses from the scene of the incident and admitted that they had discovered the DNA of the Simpsons in it.
Police said after Simpson’s interrogation that he confessed to the deadly shooting.
Advocate says his son-in-law is set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge East Church District Corps Corps Office released a preliminary report on Friday, citing a gunshot wound to the neck after the murder.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police Missionary Force for tracking down the fugitive criminal, the State Police Crime Investigation Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local residents in their collaboration in the investigation that led to the arrest of the criminal.
L.S.U. Sports Director Joey Olivia thanked lawmakers for “trying to bring justice to justice.”
Sam was 20 years old.
The Ford 6-ft-6 player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wien also played for the LSU basketball team.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, Will Wade coach of the LSU basketball team said he was beaten to death by Gitch and Tecan.
Wade said, “That’s not what you’re always worried about.”
The volcano erupted over Mexico City.
The rising ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached Mexico’s southern neighbor.
After the volcano lifted off the hole, the National Center for Preventing Crisis on Saturday warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano and stabilized 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
This center monitors a number of noises and vibrations underneath.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash that have covered windshields of motorbikes in Mexico City, such as the areas of Zochimilco.
Geophysicists found an increase in volcanic activity after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that shook the center of Mexico in September 2017, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.
The volcano, known as Don Guo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of voting for independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested after clashes between pro-independence protesters and anti-insurgency police, while thousands of people were detained on the frontlines of the opposition's first anniversary of the controversial separation vote.
The anti-insurgency police fired at a group of self-proclaimed masks, eggs, and colored powder that caused a black tornado on the roads that are usually attracted to tourists.
Late in the day, protesters were also handcuffed by the police, which caused the police to use handcuffs to prevent clashes.
For several hours, independentist groups chanted that "it is not forgotten, it is not forgiven" and that the protesters were shouting "Long live Spain."
According to local media reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests.
A year after my October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but was welcomed by Catalan separatists, tensions are still rising in the region that believes in independence.
Voters voted for independence by a definitive majority, although the share was low and those opposed to the separation had sanctioned the voting process.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to block voting at polling stations across the region with violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups marched into the tent on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The protests continued, but under pressure they were forced to take different paths.
Narcisse Thyrmis, 68, an electrician who shared these protests with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's chance of independence.
He added: “Last year we were in the best moments of our lives.
“I saw my parents crying because they were happy to vote, but now we’re confused.”
In December of last year, despite managing a fateful success, even though few in the logical elections, the Catalan independence parties will fight this year, with most of their well-known leaders, either for self-imposed exile, or for an organized detention awaiting trial.
John Puig, a 42-year-old teacher who recorded police support protests on his phone, said the clashes were sparked by politicians on both sides.
He said, “It’s getting more and more upset.”
On Saturday, Oriol Jancuiras, one of Catalonia's top nine leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections will be the best way to refute the democratic and oppressive values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
London Door: Arrest of several men after motorcycle crash into a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a motorcycle repeatedly collided with a house in London.
News of the incident was released on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. BST in Bolinago Crisanto.
Bob Blamings said that the gates and the building itself were destroyed.
On some parts of the motor, the bow hawk has also been shot.
The 0-1 Minga beat the Rangers to win for Livingstone
Dolly Minga's first win in favor of Livingston kept the win.
Livingston, who climbed to a higher stage, shook it by defeating the Rangers and this is the team's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Iberox Club.
The Dolly-Minga hit proved the distinction so that the Gary Halt faction took second place with the Hibernians.
Garzad will remain uninterrupted for the championship this season and face the eight-pointed Leaders of the Hertz next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers had hosted Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston has continued to advance without defeat in this section to six games led by coach Holt since last month’s replacement of Keene Miller, who is still set to experience failure.
Livingston lost the chance to Blant Vizier.
With Holt's team also having a supervisor who created all sorts of catches for the Rangers, they had to make progress long before they scored points.
Scott Robinson crossed barriers, but shifted his effort along the cheat, and then Alan Litgoo was only able to manage his effort as a domain after slipping to prevent Craig Halkitt from hitting his head along the cheat.
The host team was pleased with the Rangers' game against them, even though they knew they had the ability to capture the team in private scenes.
That's where the destiny trick came in.
Rangers gave up a free-kick and Livingston was busy with the initial moves, with Deacon Gallagher and Robinson both working together to give up Minga, who hit slow and scored from his position.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated his position but received the main defense insurmountable and Liam Keeley was certainly not worried about the goalkeeper.
This situation continued until the second half, although Alfredo Murillo defended to prevent the kick-off.
Pittman's lead was defended by goalkeepers Alan McGregor and Litgo with a wide blow to the game direction.
The advance to Livingston Square continued to be constantly defended, though two claims of Panathi – after Halkitt’s claim to Glenn Middleton replaced the player, and one for handball – were dismissed by hints.
"Excellent" by Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Square
A great performance and result for Livingstone.
For a man, these were great, which went beyond the expectations of the climbing path of the throw.
Since returning to the high jump, how they played and their players have changed very little, but the most points to Halt have come back since he entered the field due to his way of motivating the team.
He had several heroes.
"Captain Halkitt was excellent, managing a very regular defense while Mingau had worried about Connor Goldson and Joe Verlaine during the race.
Gretchen Rangers lacked inner motivation.
They were very good when they were in custody, but now they don't have those standards.
They lacked the final ball – they only left the main side open once – and it was something like calling out for Rangers to find themselves in place of the immunity.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), the meeting of the Turkish and German leaders at breakfast in Berlin was filled with laughter and fantasies.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s immediate visit to Germany – which aims to rebuild relations between NATO allies.
They had tensions about issues such as human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
Then Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish nationals living outside Turkey.
The police prevented 25,000 people from entering the mosque for security reasons, but the vast majority of supporters gathered to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – most of them did – also raised their voices, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The different protests reflect the division in which the German Turks welcomed the visitor as a hero and insulted him, on the other hand, arrogantly.
Traffic Accident on the Diptford Road: Riding a bicycle as a result of a collision with a motorcycle lost his life
In London, a bicycle rider was killed in an accident with a motorcycle.
The incident took place at 10:15 a.m. BST near Twentywood Road and Iwlin Road, which is a paved road in Diptford, southeast of the city.
The motorist stopped and first aid arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The incident occurred a few months after another rider was killed as a result of a motorcycle crash and escape on Childers Road, about a mile away from the scene on Saturday.
The city police said their officers were seeking to identify the man and inform his family members.
The road blocked and the route of the bus motors was changed and the riders were guided to the motorcycle to be far from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured as a result of Rebellion
The prison office said six prison officers were wounded as a result of the riot in the men's prison, which is under strict security measures.
The riot began around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still ongoing.
Tornado Special Agents entered the scene to stem the riot, which included eight prisoners and one faction of the building.
Mild injuries inflicted on the faces of the officers at the scene of the accident were treated.
A prison service spokesman said: “Special trainee personnel have been deployed to contain the current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
The injuries of six members of the staff were treated.
We are not taking the violence in our prison, and we are definitively declaring that those responsible for the incident will be referred to the police and will spend a longer period behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was undergoing medical treatment after an attack on a prisoner.
And in October last year, the anti-insurgency police were asked to stop a massive insurgency in which employees were attacked by billiard balls.
Windstorms threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Lake City with flood threats (dry areas will benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical storm to attack Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen at the earliest opportunity next week if the sea-storm energy flows along the desert to the southwest that risks flooding.
The National Weather Service will now issue flood alerts on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, heading south and east Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected to take its direct route to the Phoenix on Tuesday, which will be approaching with rain at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that "Since 1950, only ten tropical storms have kept the status of tropical or tropical storms at a distance of 200 miles from the Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a 40-mile-long windstorm on the Arizona border.
The latest forecasts by the National Wind Administration, rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, and in remote areas such as Mogulon River, Arizona, forecast rainfall of up to 6 inches.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, there is probably 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and in remote areas there is a total of up to 4 inches of rainfall.
For those who are not in danger of flooding, since these areas are suffering from drought, the rain of the day will be a blessing to them.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, and because the southeast is already experiencing a drought situation, some of this rain is likely to turn out to be useful.
According to the U.S. Drought Supervisory Authority, only more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least severe drought, which is the second highest category," weather.com reported.
The Rosa wind route runs along Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, to a land landing.
In the morning of Sunday morning, with strong winds and maximum wind speeds of 85 miles per hour, it flows 385 miles further south to Punta Yugoslava, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
In the Pacific Ocean, the storm is facing cold waters, weakening its strength.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with a severe storm in the afternoon or dinner on Monday.
Rainfall will be heavy in parts of Mexico and face a serious flood risk.
“Weather.com is expected to see a total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and there is a possibility of up to 10 inches of rainfall.”
Then, the days before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, it will flow north along Mexico like a tropical storm that will later take its way from Arizona to Southern Utah later on Tuesday night.
"The major hazards predicted by Daya or its effects are heavy rainfall in Baja California, Sonora Northwest and the southwestern U.S. desert," the National Wind Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will cause life-threatening floods and the flow of flowers and dust in the deserts and mountain slides in the mountain valleys.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people who tried to kill were arrested
After a 16-year-old man was found wounded by a knife in Sumnersitt, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenage boy, who was injured, was found on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. BST in the Oxfordshire Territory of Meadow Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where he is in “good” health.
Police said a 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials have asked all those who have taken pictures of what happened on the phone to testify.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Has Been Out of Democratic Party's "Postwarfare and Anger"
Trump said at a meeting in Willing, South Virginia, that “the vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the oppressive and violent tactics of the Democratic Party.”
Trump said Kavanaugh had become the Democratic Party's "post cheer and anger" during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress and strongly and emotionally denied the accusation made by Christian Blasi Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades earlier when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said the "people of America saw Kavanaugh's talent, decency and courage that day."
Speaking to his supporters in West Virginia, he said, “Voting for approval of Judge Cavanaugh is one of the deadliest legal brains of our time, a lawyer with a valuable public service record.”
The President, while talking about the importance of the Republican rally in the mid-term elections, marginally pointed to Kavanaugh’s candidacy.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not competing in the election, I’m really competing.”
“That’s why I’m fighting for the best candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
A senior vice-chairman of the GOP said the CNN is expected to hold the first key trial vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination by Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed as a result of the earthquake in Indonesia, the loss is increasing
Officials said on Saturday that large waves hit the coast and a severe earthquake and tsunami shook Indonesia's Sulawesi island, killing at least 384 people and destroying many.
On Friday, as hundreds of people gathered at a festival in the city of Palo, waves hit the beach at a height of six meters (18 feet) and darkened the air, dragging many to the brink of death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Sutopo Poro Noguru, spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB Natural Disaster Reduction Agency, told a news conference in Jakarta that “Yesterday when the tsunami threat rose, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, thus becoming victims.”
Nogruho stated that "the tsunami was not alone, it had motorbikes, tree-cutting, houses, and it smashed everything on the ground," adding that the tsunami had occurred before hitting the coast, along the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour).
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 tons were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Space images released by the Natural Incidents Agency showed a large number of buildings and stores destroyed, bridges smashed and destroyed, and a mosque enclosed in water.
On Saturday, the earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million tons.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the force distributed by the intense earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
He said the geographic location of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, has increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nagorno-Karabakh described the destruction as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of several victims were found trapped under the rubble of the buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nugroho said there would be more loss and damage along the 300-kilometer (190-mile) coastline in northern Palu, an area known as Dongala that is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Nogruho said communications were "completely paralyzed and informationally unavailable" from Dongala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that "more than 300,000 people lived there, adding that staff and volunteers have been sent to areas in crisis.
“It’s a tragedy now, but it’s going to get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami that struck Palo, although officials said the waves had arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a non-violent tape posted on social media, a man was heard from the house above a building warning the tsunami's approach to the people down the road.
Within minutes, a water dam hit the beach and crashed buildings and motorcycles.
Reuters could not confirm the accuracy of the tape immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused severe power and communications cuts, which caused those responsible to struggle to coordinate rescue efforts.
Army officials said they had begun sending relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but the survivors were in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airfield will be reopened for relief efforts and will be blocked until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit the evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to more than 800
This is very bad.
Mr. Dosiba said that while the World Vision employees have come from Dongala to Palu, where the employees are busy installing tents in their offices, they are on their way through devastating scenes.
“They told me they saw the houses that were all destroyed.”
This is very bad.
Although relief groups were doing the hard work to help, some complained that foreign aid specialists had been prevented from traveling to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, only if equipment and employment are prolonged from abroad can the location of the crisis be declared as a national crisis area.
This has not happened so far.
Olivia Arani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: “This is still a crisis at the state level.”
"As soon as the government says, 'Yes, this is a national crisis,' we can take action with international aid, but this legal situation has not yet arisen."
While the second night after the quake occurred on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be a miracle to change the unpleasant lines of the story of natural events.
On Saturday, a teenage boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman with her mother’s body lying beside her, trapped under rubble for two days.
Guindon Subandonoo coached the Indonesian national paratroopers, training two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people who had been trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandy, were his disciples.
"As a paratrooper in the paratrooper section, I carry my own emotional burden."
Mr. Guindon described how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Hotel Rova Rova in the paratrooper community, he sent countless messages to the Palu competitors who were attending the beach festival on WhatsApp.
However, the result of his messages instead of a pair of blue marks was just a gray mark.
He said, “I think that meant not sending messages.”
Thieves stole $26,750 from a landlocked dam in Newport during a T.M. re-deposit
Based on a Newport Police Department newsletter, thieves stole $26,750 from Brinke’s employee who was depositing a TM in a land dam in Newport on Friday morning.
The motorcycle driver was at the entertainment complex emptying an ATM and ready to add more money to it, Dit Denis McCarthy wrote in the newsletter.
While he was entertaining his job, someone else "runned behind Brinke's employee" and stole a cash box that was with him to deliver.
According to the paper, objective witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Those who have information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 3680-292-859.
Connie West: Rap Juan turns his name into Yi
Connie West transforms rapper John’s name into a yes.
On Saturday, he announced a change of name on Twitter: "It's officially becoming known as Connie Wise."
He was 41 years old, who was expelled from Yi for a while and released his eighth album, Maniker, in June.
The change in her appearance took place at a live concert on Saturday night, in which her new album Yandi is set to release.
The creator of the show stated that he was crying in the show instead of the singer Ariana, who canceled it because of "emotional delirium."
In addition to being the abbreviation for his current artistic name, Wisst said some time ago that the word was also of religious importance to him.
Speaking about the album's title with radio host Big Bai earlier this year, Wist said, "I think Y is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'."
"Well, I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
I’ve changed from a mineral that means only one thing to just one thing – to reflect the good, the bad, the confusion, and everything else we have.
This album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who changed his name.
In the past, Sin Cambus was known as Puff, Puff, or Puff, but this year he announced the names of Lu and his brother Lu as his will.
A former co-worker wanted to measure a choice for himself with a spaced line and capital letters.
Amoye Mexico vows not to use the military against landlords
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use the military against property owners as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody violence against students.
On Saturday, López Obrador vowed in Telatilolco Square that "he will never use the army to suppress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing up to 300 people when leftist student movements were forming across Latin America.
López Obrador pledged to support the opening of more free public universities by granting government grants to young Mexican students.
He said unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities pushed young people towards criminal groups.
The U.S. needs to double the rate of artificial intelligence.
Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that while China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on top of research in this area.
This view was expressed after various sections of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, although there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence across the U.S.
Last year, China unveiled its plan to rank 1st in AI inventions by 2030.
"Double-funding artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, we expect a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
In an interview with CNN this week, Lee said that doubling the length of the deal would double the chances of gaining the next big achievement in the U.S. artificial intelligence industry.
Lee, whose book "All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order" was published by Hatton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Wincher's revision and has invested in one of China's most famous AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Millon University on the AI system, which defeated Atilo, America's highest-ranking player, and later Carnegie, Microsoft's chief research officer and chairman of Google's representative office in China.
Lee appreciated the former U.S. government for its technological competition such as the Chilean Robotics Agency's Advanced Defense Research Projects, and sought to hold a new round to help identify future ideas.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
Lee said, “It’s not China that drives away scientific leaders, it’s the companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other companies have hired top tech professionals from universities to work on top of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy would also help the U.S. boost efforts on artificial intelligence.
“I think the Green Card should be automatically given to people with a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese government released a plan to unveil the next generation of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that China’s Natural Science Foundation, like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that distribute money to U.S. researchers, enlarges the membership of academic institutions, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center aimed at bringing together partners from scientific factories and institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee on artificial intelligence.
And DARPA has announced a $2 million investment in an innovative program called AI Next.
According to the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the U.S. law enforcement agency, which has been seeking the formation of a national security commission on artificial intelligence, has not acted for several months.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name.
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in an all-out poll about changing the country's name to the "North Macedonian Republic," a move that will resolve decades of tension with Greece, which has been hampering efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that its northern neighbor’s name means claiming its territory and has made it a member of NATO and the Arpaean Union.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President George Ivanovo said he would not vote in all polls, and the fight against the sanctions has led to speculation as to whether the number of subscribers for the credibility of all polls will meet the criteria of at least 50 percent.
The question on everyone’s questionnaire was: “Do you want to join NATO and Europe by accepting a deal with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayo, argue that Macedonia’s efforts to join the European Union and NATO are also worth paying for, a country that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Oliviera Georgijuska, 79, said: "I came today to vote for the future of the country and the young Macedonians so that they can live independently under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us."
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they would accept the result of the vote to be definitive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The government’s Election Commission said there had been no disorderly reports until 1 p.m.
However, in all of these polls, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34 percent in the last 2016 parliamentary elections, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
A 62-year-old voter in Skopje said: "I'm here to vote for my son, our place is in Europe."
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayu, his wife Zorica and son Doshko used their vote in all Macedonian polls on changing the name of the country that will open the way to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardako was preparing a small controversy and setting up chairs in front of the tent, which had been installed by all-persecutive sanctioners.
"We are in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we want to achieve membership with a high head, not through the gates of service," he said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us in the name of Macedonia, we can go elsewhere like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian solidarity.”
Prime Minister Zhao says membership in NATO will attract much-needed investment, while the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe the majority will be very supportive because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supporters of the European Union and NATO," he said.
He said a "yes" outcome would be "adopting our future."
A survey published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in all polls below the level required to subscribe.
The findings of another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed 57 percent of respondents deciding to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To win all the polls, it is necessary that the number of subscribers must be 50 plus one percent of the vote.
The failure of all the polls marks the first major blow to Western-supported government policy since the power grab last May.
See: Sergio Aguirre, Manchester City, opened his way to deception from the middle of the defense
On Saturday, at the Manchester City Union Stadium, Sirgiu Aguirre and Rahim Stirling rushed to defend Brighton's 0-2 victory for Manchester City.
In the 65th minute, Aguirre made the trick easy.
The Argentine woman cheated a pass from the middle of the field at the beginning of the season.
He competed between the three defenders of Brighton before breaking open.
Then he found himself enclosed among the four green garments.
He ran ahead of a defender several times in the corner of the penalty area before crossing hard.
Then he turned to his left to pass Sterling.
The English forward made his first entrance to the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguirro and he struck with his right foot towards the right-hand side towards goalkeeper Brightoni Matthew Ryan.
City manager Pip Guardiola told reporters, “Aguillo is struggling with some of the problems he has on his feet.”
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes in the morning.
That's what happened.
It was our lucky chance that he got the score of a cheat at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blue Sky the first score in the Premier League fight.
This was done in the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguirre won the ball in the field of Brighton.
He took a beautiful pass along the left side that passed through the opposing team to Leroy San.
Sun did a few ball exercises before rushing towards the vertical shot of the gate.
The player in the front line of the blue sky slid the ball before sliding off the field.
At 12:55 on Saturday in the Rhine-Niger Square in Sinsheim, Germany, City will go to the Champions League group stage in the match against Hahneim.
Max Schiller wants to go to the Rockies to hit the target.
While the national cover was eliminated from the competition in the final game, there was not much reason to have to start again.
But Sweetser is always hopeful of throwing the ball against the Colorado Rockies by Sunday, but only if there is still a final result for the Rockies, who are ahead of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
On Friday night, the Rockies won 2-5 over the national team, earning at least one warning card, but are still trying to retain the first-tier title.
"While we're playing for no one, we'll at least be able to create a problem for the final season, knowing that Joe here at Dinoir is overwhelmed and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any score I've seen in my mental year.
“Why don’t I compete in that?”
National Coat of Arms is still set to announce its launch for Sunday, but reports show that they preferred to allow the dairy farmer to throw in as well.
Sweeter, who is due to make his 34th start, hit his hardest on Thursday and will launch Sunday with normal ease.
In the current season, the Washington right-handed player in 220 2/3 rounds of the race, has 7-18 with 2.53 average showers earned and 300 eliminations from the race.
Trump has a meeting in West Virginia.
While talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, the President pointed out the situation related to the election of Bert Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court in a televised way.
“Everything we’ve done is in the month of November.
We are six weeks away from one of the most important elections of our era.
This is very important and very important – I’m not fighting in the elections, but I’m really fighting, which is why I’m fighting everywhere for outstanding candidates,” he said.
"You see this horrific, horrific, radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using any tools you need, you see the mail and the ugly.
They are not afraid of who is hurting, those who participate in the election are just for the sake of power and control, what they want is power and control, we don’t decide to give it to them.”
He said the Democrats were on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and disgraceful and ugly and liar."
Referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee, while referring to Sen. Dianne Finstein as a Democrat, he was welcomed by the public in a loud voice.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, ah no, I’m waiting for one – it was really non-verbal language – the worst non-verbal language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer.
This is unbearable for those who express their views.
When my faith activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was really amazing.
After all, I was the last member of the Workers’ Party in Parliament who was not welcomed by us – all because we expressed our opinion.
John Ryan was treated in the same way as my parliamentary colleague, as he also stood firmly against anti-Jewishism.
In my case, the censoring moves criticized me for opposing Jeremy Carbine.
He slandered former leaders about the importance of responsive economic policy, national security, Europe and other similar issues.
A statement Friday to the East Nottingham Workers' Party said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and fruitful."
During the eight years of working as a member of the local Labour Party in Parliament, Friday night meetings of the GC were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, most of the meetings do not have this space and the commitment to a policy of "more kindness and dignity" has been forgotten by many before and will never actually return.
It is increasingly obvious that opposing theories are not taken into account in the Labour Party, and views that are accepted by the Party leadership are considered.
This situation began shortly after Crimea took the lead, as colleagues with those who previously thought we had similar political views, expecting me to change direction and take a position that I never agreed to – whether on national security or on the single market of the EU.
Whenever I speak in public – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – their comrades make fiery speeches on social media, demanding de-escalation and denial of the centre’s politics, and telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And this experience is not just me.
In fact, I’m happier than my other comrades, as the theories about me tended to be more political.
I am amazed at the hard work and determination of those comrades who are flooded with sexual and racial abuse statements every day, but they are never ashamed.
One of the most disappointing areas of contemporary politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Carbine called on the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer who we are, and with every move of “no confidence” or change in the rules of his choice, this party will become more profitable.
I’ve had a lot of advice in the last two years, I’ve been asked to lower my head and not raise my voice so much and be “good”.
But that’s not what I came into politics for.
Thirty-two years before I joined the Workers’ Party as a school student, I was stirred by the lack of attention from the Thatcher government, which literally made my school’s comprehensive curriculum collapse, and I was trying to provide a better service to those who need it most.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham was at all confused about political stances and areas of opposition to the current leadership.
To those who launched the movement on Friday, I tell everyone that while the country is struggling to get to Brexit, which will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I don’t see any interest in spending my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually, the message I have is not that my trust in Nottingham is real, but that of my clients, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not. I am proud to serve you and I pledge that there will be no threat to my choice or political compromise in any of the areas in which I am involved.

IR 17 - 38 Milros: IR was unsuccessful at the top
The last two attempts may have changed the final result in some way, but there’s no doubt that Irene deserves a win in this amazing and fun day’s championship.
They are now the head of the table, the only unsuccessful side of the ten-man team.
In the end, it was the defense of the superiors that further increased the odds that the main side did, and coach Peter Morchi was right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in this game, and we haven't been defeated yet, so I should be happy."
Robin Christy Miller said, “The score goes back to IR, they had a better chance than us.”
Grant Andersen's 14th-minute attempt was rejected by outsider Clemente, but a yellow card was given to Scottish team captain Rory Hoggs, who resigned to play by the fighters, allowing Mirlos to express the numbers, and Jason Baggott made an irreversible attempt.
Clemmou scored with his hand, which resulted in a penalty shoot-out, before he scored before the halftime, then started a slow effort to score at 5-17.
But Milros started the second half well and Patrick Andrewson's effort was rejected by Baggot, which reduced Levy to five points.
Then a long pause was announced due to the severe injury of Robert Nott, who had been lying down, and from the beginning Irving passed through the efforts of Stafford McDowell, who was defended by Clemmou.
Captain Ire Blair McPherson was given a yellow card, and once again Milros with an extra player was put up against Bruce Colvin's invincible effort at the end of a sudden, pressing attack.
Although the main faction came back, and when Starvan Hutchinson took the yellow card from the penalty-line mark because of clamping down on Klimo without hitting the ball, McFerson crashed into the front of Ir.
Clemmou began, while doing almost everything again from the beginning, after Keeley Royce fell within David Armstrong's penalty range, tossing Arty on the main side with the fifth attempt of Gregory.
The Star of the Game prepares for his new career in the restaurant industry.
It seems that Steele's star, Ford Kearan, took up a hospitality job after he was unveiled as president of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man, who starred and writes on the BBC's full-length show Jack Jarvis, played along with his longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth series will be the final part of the show, in which Kiran will be screened after Craigling is planning to live.
According to the official lists of history, he is the director of Adriftmam Lemitide.
The actor declined to comment on the news, though a source at Szczecin noted that Kiran was looking to participate in the "prosperous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia enclosed on land hopes to pave the way to the Pacific
Sailors who were sailing on a ship equipped with chains and ropes were caught in the centre of La Paz.
Above the public buildings are blue-sea flags.
The sea bases from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon are engraved with the slogan: “The sea is legally ours.”
It’s a strange thing to get it back.”
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memorial to the loss of a beach to Chile as a result of a bloody 19th century war is still standing – a once again regrettable seafaring in the Pacific Ocean.
Probably over the decades, these aspirations have been at their highest levels, as Bolivia, after five years of deliberation, awaits the International Court of Justice judgment on October 1.
A Bolivian diplomat, Roberto Calzadilla, said: "Bolivia has a determination, a spirit of unity and determination, and naturally expects results with a positive outlook.
Most Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice’s verdict on big screens across the country, and they hope that the court in The Hague – after decades of irregular negotiations – will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim, Chile’s bailiff is obliged to grant the bail.
Bolivia’s Indigenous and Charismatic President Ivo Morales – who is facing a controversial struggle to re-electe next year – is also scheduled to face trial on Monday.
He promised in late August that “we are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean.”
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia – and if it does, it will not bring about much change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no power to pardon the territory of Chile, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
Paz Zarati, an international law expert in Chile, said the ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) just six months after the recent arguments were dealt with showed that the case was not "complex".
And beyond the advance of the Bolivian issue, the past four years may have brought it back.
Zarati said “the issue of access to the sea has been plundered by the current Bolivian government.”
Morales’ wartime saying has weakened any remaining good intentions in Chile, he said.
On some issues, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate, but after that decision, it is very difficult to maintain the discussions.
Since 1962, the two countries have not separated from each other.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Wiltz, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, denied the allegations that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
He said Monday would bring with him "a wonderful opportunity to open a new period of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139-year-old opposition and common interests" to Bolivia.
Calzadilla also denied Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most influential presidents, claiming that he uses the issue of the sea as a political backdrop.
“Bolivia will never waive its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“This is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be achieved until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ray Yong-ho said his country would never defuse its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ray was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow up on commitments made at the Singapore summit of leaders among rival leaders.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the brink of a resumption of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korea’s Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ray says that continuing U.S. sanctions and protests against a declaration ending the Korean War will always bring the North to its knees, a "unrealistic dream."
Washington is vigilant about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking the necessary disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking for a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about putting aside an arsenal that the country probably knows is the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show will showcase the latest clothing from the big halls on its way to the big road near you.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, don’t wait any longer.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown showcased a series of unusual costumes for their SS19 collection in a hallway that was stunning among the fashion collections during Paris Fashion Week.
The very out-of-the-box hats have covered Instagram this summer and these designers have picked up their eye-catching creations in the hallways.
A ball standing by Valentino had an overly beige hat, decorated with a wide, full-rim that swept the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories include decorated ink turbans, wizard caps, and even pineapples – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a set of amazing masks and only for use on Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than the design of high fashion clothes.
One of these creations was similar to a water-breathing game gear that also had a breathing device and water-goggles, while the other was similar to an ice-cream cone.
And if you continue the big fashion statement - you're lucky.
Lightweight observers predict that flat, large-sized cliffs can reach large roads near you.
Large-sized hats heat up on the heels of "La Bomba", a basket hat with an edge to the width of two feet at each head ranging from Rihanna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The cult tag on the back of the hat, which was so useless and scattered on social media - it introduced another great creativity to the hallway - was a beach basket box almost the size of the swimwear model that covered it.
The burnt orange raffia box, smashed with raffia fabrics and covered with a white leather handle, was the ball standing in the La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a prominent designer, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive on the big road in the coming summers - as the designer has made such a big impact it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edwards: Linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
The Independent Schools of Scotland hold a record of academic excellence, and in 2018 this continues with another set of superb test results, which is reinforced only by individual and collective success in sport, art, music, and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Independent School Council (SCIS), the school strives to provide the best level of service to its pupils and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and adapt a custom schooling program, we are witnessing that modern languages continue to be a popular and favorite subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, a message comes to his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, the message will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to establish relationships and trust with the people of other countries.
From the results of the last year’s psychic exams, we see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest scores among independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have mastered foreign languages earned a higher A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students in Mandarin were graded higher than A, while 72% of German-speaking students, 69% of French-speaking students, and 63% of Spanish-speaking students were graded A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now offered as a subject of choice in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subject line in independent schools and elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey by the UK Labour and Skills Commission, it was found that 17 percent of the reasons employers are trying to fill vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more, language skills are becoming necessary in order to prepare young people for their future jobs.
With more expected career opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are very important in the globalized world.
Regardless of the job a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, having a lifelong skill like this is a real advantage in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically pass a person with multilingual skills through the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language sufficiently for conversation, and only with a two-digit 15 percent, they were able to speak French.
That’s why investing in language education is so important for today’s children.
Learning several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, gives children a better chance of getting targeted jobs.
Within Scotland, the teaching languages of each school will be different.
A number of schools will focus on very modern classical languages, while others will be teaching languages that are more important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese, by the threshold of 2020.
Whatever your child’s interest is, they will always have a number of languages on offer in independent schools with educational backgrounds that specialize in this field.
The Independent Schools of Scotland are dedicated to providing another educational environment in which to prepare and equip children with the skills necessary for success and what is needed in the future.
In today’s age, the fact cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages are of vital importance for the future of the country, so the language must be reflected in the field of education.
In fact, modern languages really should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent Schools continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent School Council.
On Sunday, Lee Brown will play the first-ever National Lakers game in San Diego.
The wait is almost over and fans are looking to see Lee Bourne Jamesder play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play in Sunday's first pre-season game against Denver Nagts in San Diego.
It is not yet clear whether he will play for a few minutes.
Walton said on the Lickers' official website, "It's going to be more than one and less than 48."
Leakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Following the practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans to split the pre-season six-game timers.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career," he said.
Time of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off a perennial company rally tonight in Willinging, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump meetings scheduled next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With Trump’s endorsement of the man he’s chosen to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court, he intends to win back in the midterm elections in the coming election because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in West Virginia is scheduled for Saturday at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the live streaming of Trump's West Virginia rally online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to make a speech at this week’s hearing at the Supreme Court nominee, Bert Kavanaugh, which has been undermined by a week-long FBI probe over allegations of sexual misconduct with the Senate’s predicted affirmative vote.
But the main goal of this passionate rally is to help Republicans who are under the influence of the November election accelerate it.
According to Reuters, President Trump’s campaign office said the five meetings next week were aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to win a majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
Trump’s campaign spokesman, who did not want his name to be revealed, told Reuters: “Congress control is on his agenda so much that if necessary, he will travel to all states as soon as possible on the threshold of entering the campaign season.”
According to the West Virginia Metro News, an evening rally scheduled at Wisbanko Square in Willing could take fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania with them and be covered by Pittsburgh media."
It will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he scored more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate in the Senate in West Virginia who has a low vote, win.
Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters: "It's not a good sign for him that the president should come and take Maurice's stance in the polls."
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team is determined to fight to keep the hopes of a singles game alive Sunday
After three one-way seasons, the four-man game on Saturday afternoon might be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing with a quick move is a pretty good sport concept, but players who are really interested in it have never been interested in other competitions like this game.
So where do they say the fast move is now?
Giordano Spite said while he wanted for the race day: "They had a six-point score and now it's four, so I guess I'm stimulating it a bit."
Europe has this score, though four points with twelve more games ahead.
As Spitty says, Americans feel like they have wind in their own windy boat and have exactly what they need to be encouraged, at least Spitty and Justin Thomas are encouraged to play together all day, each with three points out of four points.
Speed’s progression from goal to field is excellent and is a leading example.
As he got his turn, the shouts of the wingers grew louder, and while he and Thomas had two points, two points less, they earned four points by throwing the ball into the golf hole.
Another throw, which scored 15 points, was welcomed by other similar shouts, indicating that he believed the American team was not out of it either.
Speight said, "You really have to hit the goal straight and worry about your race."
All the other players are left now.
18 holes to create a brand.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spite and Thomas are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is the true story of the Ryder Cup.
The unique but praiseworthy couple are four out of four Europeans and can’t make any mistakes.
The Mollywoods were the only pair that didn't throw a single more than a pass on Saturday afternoon, but they also refused to strike on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and not back on Friday morning.
The performance and manner in which the crowd consumed their energy apparently motivated the players who could win on Sunday, and as the sun sets on the National Lee Golf, there was no more influx of players against Fleetwood and Molinary.
Preferably, both were placed simultaneously on different holes.
However, talking about the glory and majesty of Europe is still premature.
Boba Watson and the Simpsons teamed up with Alex Norris to try Sergio Garcia, the champion of the morning's four balls.
One single blow and two double blows in front of the nine-man group entered the Cave of Spaniards and Swedes and they would never climb it.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of the pit.
Due to the interaction between the two game partners, the advice they gave and not given, and the way a strategy can make immediate changes, it’s very enjoyable to watch four-player and four-player players closely.
Europe has played better as a team so far and won a major lead to reach the final game, but this four-man season continued to show that the U.S. team has a decisive decision to fight against that number, especially as the Americans themselves had doubts about it.
Europe won the final of the Rider's Cup with a difference of 10-6 seats
After a 6-10 lead against the United States in the four-player and four-player championships, Europe successfully climbed to the final of the Ryder Cup.
Motivated by Duo Tommy Flyt and Francesco Molinari, with a win over Tiger Woods, they were thrilled to keep their score in the National Golf League to four points so far.
Thomas Beavern, on the European side, in an effort to keep his prize, which he had lost two years ago at Hazlelin, won the American side in the morning quarter-finals, defeating the 1-3 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in a four-man span that won two races but failed to break the score.
Jim Forrick’s team needs eight points out of 12 singles races on Sunday to keep their prize.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who both call it a "mulioud" combination, are the only second pair to win since the start of their four races in Ride history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four-Piece Game, they super-gelled to defeat the invincible and newcomer Woods of Bryson Ditchambio with a further emphasis on 4&5.
Woods, who tied his two-match draw on Saturday, shone brightly on special occasions but lost 19 of his 29 games in quad and quad games and seven games in a row.
Justin Day, while resting for a morning quadruple game, returned to partner Henry Stanson in the quadruple game, defeating 1&2 friends Johnson and Brooks Coppa - ranked in the world's first and third ranks.
Europe did not have it all on a pleasant and windy day, in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas, who won three major victories, scored two points on Saturday.
They won a two-and-a-half victory over the Spaniards Rumherty and Polter, and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory McLaughlin by losing two opening holes and a three-and-four in a four-player game.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cup, a team returned to singles, although as a keeper, the Foreman team only needed an equaliser to keep the prize.
However, after two days of being in the top two, the attack-against Sunday seems to be beyond them.
North Korea says there is "no way" to disarm one-sided without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the U.N. on Saturday that continued sanctions would cause the country to distrust the United States and in no way can its country renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such a situation.
Ri Yong-hoe told the World General Assembly's annual body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear data technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, there is no way that we can first of all unilaterally disarm," he said.
While Ray reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stage-by-phase" approach to nuclear disarmament and taking gradual steps in the area, which would be rewarded against North Korea, he reiterated his remarks to this effect.
Ray issued a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to try to "secure the Korean Peninsula's nuclear weapons."
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the lifting of severe international sanctions against North Korea, he said.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal in a compulsory way, and even protests the 'end of the war'.
"The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an unrealistic dream for people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions increases our distrust.”
Ray did not mention any plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mon Jie over the past five months, adding: "If the opposite side were the nuclear denuclearization issue, South Korea, not the United States, the destruction of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped."
However, the tone of Ray's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was inconceivable then "Mr. Chairman Sher" President Trump to "dead Mr. Kim."
Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy North Korea," praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament action, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should continue until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue with seriousness and without failure until we see a fully, definitive and confirmed nuclear denuclearization."
The Security Council, by consensus, has increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent delays in the funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs since 2006.
Pompeo met with Ray on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting and then said he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second session.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in June, saying that within a few hours the advance had been made only for North Korea, condemning him for having "similar desires of the gang of thugs."
North Korea pledged to meet with Moon this month, if the United States takes "relevant action," it will destroy the missile site as well as a nuclear set.
Kim said the "relevant measures" he was pursuing were security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore and a move to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University Students Take Sufficient Courses to Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year calls on all students who sleep harder to struggle with the growing culture of studying “at night” using coffee.
The findings of an academic show that the world's number one university students are often fearless about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Seissler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist at the Naseem Brigham Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After speaking about the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process, he was motivated to start this course.
In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are these things being told to me now that I'm a student last year?"
He told the Telegraph newspaper that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep – which surprised me.
This course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains the essentials of good sleep habits in academic and sports performance, as well as the general well-being of students.
Paul Barira, a professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said: “The university decided to introduce this course after being diagnosed that students are seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section, there is an image of a Lily Room where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, tutorials and books to talk about the effects of caffeine and lightness, and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of daily sleep time for them.
Another section tells participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive symbols, then encourages participants to think about their daily affairs.
“We know that this behavior of students will not change immediately.
Professor Chistler added: "We believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to be informed of the health effects of smoking."
He said a culture of pride in “drawing the living at night” still exists, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students that cause sleep deprivation have been an increasing problem.
He said that to ensure adequate and good quality sleep, the student's "secret weapon" should be to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even causing weight loss, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old Californian who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Seissler plan the course because he had one of his genders with him last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and motivated him to pursue a course at university level.
He said he hoped that the next step would be for all undergraduate students to complete a similar training program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Zissler advised that students should set the alarm to go to bed and wake up, and be informed of the damaging effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic panels and LED lighting, which can disrupt the rhythm of your nighttime sleep situation and disrupt your daytime sleep situation.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Minga defeated Gerard players
While Dolly Manga hit the split side to defeat Steven Gerard 0-1 at Livingston, the Rangers faced another terrifying race.
After winning 1–4 February at S.T. Johnston, the Abruzzes team was looking to record their first win, but Team Gray Holt only recorded a second defeat to Gerard in 18 games as a coach to give his team eight full points of goalless victory to Leaders Hert champion Ladbrokes from Hand.
Minga hit his punch seven minutes ahead of half-time and the lineup of Rangers who were lacking motivation was unbalanced.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston is ranked third with a scoring difference and only behind Hibernian.
After apparently an object was thrown from a distance and hit the head of Calum Spence's line-up referee, he had to be treated, and there might be problems in Ranger's trap.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that eliminated the former Ire in the semi-finals of the Bitfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Levy 11, who scored a Hertz score last week, and he would be delighted to see how well he would prevent his opponents in each turn as a group.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston made more effort with the ball at their disposal.
They should have cheated just two minutes after the first minga hit was sent by Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder made a lot of effort with a high chance.
Keegan Jacobs’ intense free kick went to Captain Craig Halcott, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, only returned from a good angle behind the penalty area.
The Rangers gained their dominance but seemed to have more hopes of playing their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morlos certainly felt that a penalty should be announced in the penalty area within a quarter of an hour, because he and Stephen Lauld collided, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected Colombian requests.
The Rangers only blocked two first-half shots at the goal, but Liam Kelly, a former Iberox goalkeeper, had a problem hitting Lasana Kuli Bali in an Oia Ajaria attack.
While the 34th Levy may be against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it just because of their link.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t resist Jacobs’ deep blow.
While Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson and held himself to simply throw the ball at the Minga, Scott Arfield showed no reaction.
Gerard interrupted Ryan Kent's play instead of Colibaly, and the change had an almost immediate effect on the striker hitting Murillos, but the astonishing Kiley ran from his own line to the ball to prevent it.
But Livingstone continued to draw the attention of the spectators exactly to the type of play they enjoyed, so that Litgoo and Hulk would throw the ball one after the other over long distances.
The Holt team could increase in the final stages of their forwarding, but McGregor stood up to prevent Jacobs before Litgao came out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton replaced Rangers with another inopportune claim to a penalty because he had collided with Jacobs but again overlooked Thomson.
Germany: The inventor of Geiger's counter
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" Germany: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a well-known method known as the Geiger counter.
Since becoming a major part of science, Geiger's counter has become an influential and still mainstream culture, as in the 1950 film "The Coronado Bells," starring those who seem unlikely to be cowboy scientists such as Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms turned off by the radioactive in minerals.”
Evans: "Say, it's definitely ticking now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived.
A new cancer vaccine can train the body's immune system to "watch" rebellious cells
New cancer vaccine can train the body's immune system to "watch" and kill rebellious cells
The vaccine teaches the body's immune system to identify infertile cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can "observe" common proteins in many cancers and be re-injected.
A trial vaccine in patients with a wide range of cancers shows promising results.
A woman undergoing treatment with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify rebellious cells, saw that her ovarian cancer had been gone for more than 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab so that they can see the common protein of many cancers called HER2, and then reconstructing the cells.
Professor J. Brezowski, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
Professor Brezowski explained: HER2 involves the development of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” how to target cancer cells is found in the treatment of a type of worker’s blood cancer.
Connie Whist, after appearing at a live concert on Saturday night with a MAGA hat on his head, began to support Trump’s harsh and insulting criticism.
Well, it didn't go well.
Connie Wiest was in the studio after a live performance during Saturday night's live concert in which she admired the United States, under the voices of Howe. President Donald Trump said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in which we brought the greatness back to America, he reaffirmed his support for Trump in a rhetoric against the Democrats.
“How many times do I talk to a white person and they say, ‘How can you love Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America long ago."
The live concert on Saturday night began with a performance by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Bert Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual harassment alleged by Christian Blessy Ford.
Although not broadcast, but the video footage was read-only, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule the West by posting this post.
He also complained to the audience that he had spent some difficult moments behind the scenes about his hat.
“They were on the backstage against me.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
They were abusing me!
On the basis of the Washington report, Izzyminer said, "And then they said I'm in a drowned place."
He continued, "Do you want to see the drowned place?" while saying that he would "raise the Superman, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
“Try the love.”
Varity reported that despite his remarks at least twice led to spectators killing the booboo sounds and cast members appearing embarrassed at Saturday night's live concert, another person who was there told the magazine, "The whole studio was silent."
He was introduced as a late replacement to singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper John McMuller passed away a few days ago.
He surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, and dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
The president of the conservative group TPUSA, Kandy Turner, tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for standing up for the MOB."
But Karen Hunter, the editor of the TV interview, tweeted that he wanted to simply "be absolutely amazing how he is a person."
"But I didn't choose to reward anyone (by buying music or clothes or supporting 'his' art), but rather someone I believe has a mind and encourages them to think that it's harmful to my community.
He is free.
He added that we are too.”
Prior to his performance, Rap Juan announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "officially becoming known as Connie Wise".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of vision, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and Puff Daddy.
His collaborator rapper, Senope Doug, whose previous name was Senope Line and, of course, Prince Vaughn's last prominent music character, changed his name to a symbol, and the artist was finally known as Prince.
He is charged with attempted murder for stabbing and stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Balihacamor.
The defendant is expected to appear at the local court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Kate Harrington, the star of The Crown and Toxic Masculinity, has been critically acclaimed.
Kate Harrington is famous for her role as John Seno's swordswoman in HBO's Medieval Violence Bar series, The Crown and the Throne.
But the 31-year-old actor is faced with the stereotype of a male hero and says such roles on television screens mean that young boys often feel they have to be harsh to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sandy Times, Kate said she believes “something is wrong” and asked how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the era of #MeToo.
Kate, who recently married her co-star in the game of thrones, Lizzy Day, who is also 31, admitted she feels "completely serious" about solving the issue.
He said, "I personally feel very serious about what we've had with masculinity."
“In view of the problem we see now, what have we taught men?
Kate believes television is responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its male characters to some extent.
He continued, "What is intrinsic and what is acquired?
What is taught on TV and on the streets makes young boys feel like they have to be that particular side of being a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time - how to change it?
There is clearly something wrong with the young men.
In an interview, he also admitted that after the end of the Crown and Throne series next summer, he will not play in any of its previous and subsequent sections, adding that "with the battlefields and the horses, his work is over."
From November, Kate will play the role of Sam Shepard in True West, the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is carrying a bag.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife was the best thing he ever got from the game of thrones.
She said: “I met my wife on this show, so that gave me my future family and my life.”
Day starred Kate's favorite lover, John Sano, who won the Emmy Award in the fictional series.
The couple got married in June 2018 on Lisley's family lands in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In just the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sexual intercourse, and this is a sign of change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China due to the spread of infected blood.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in the Greek state that the number of people living with HIV had dropped to nearly zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute issue in the rebellious Chinese society.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against sex offenders is too high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most illnesses are caused by inadequate sexual care in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has made a commitment to global access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address this issue.
Maxine Waters has revealed information to GOP senators who have been denied by one of her employees, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories" by critics.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that personal information about three U.S. Republican senators was being published on Wikipedia lawmakers’ pages by one of its employees.
The Los Angeles Democrats stressed that the allegations were spread by experts and "extreme right" websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter: “Lies are more hateful, lies and lies.”
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of senators such as Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Erwin Hutch, both from U.S. Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an anonymous person in Capitol Hill during a Senate court hearing over allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Bert Kavanaugh.
The revelation came a few moments after three senators from Kavanaugh asked.
Hill said conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was related to the Waters office and had published information from one of Waters’ employees.
Waters continued: “This is a completely unfounded claim and an absolute lie.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information, and security are at risk as a result of these false and false allegations - was in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie.”
Waters quickly sparked criticism, including a former White House press spokeswoman, Yes Flickr.
Flickr wrote: "This denial is due to anger."
He said: “It shows that he doesn’t believe he’s a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of what he has done, he should not be angry.
They shouldn’t hate.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They should be quiet and quiet.”
Flinders was apparently trying to compare the water reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee who is running in the midterm elections to sideline Waters, also commented on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that his office had warned "law enforcement authorities and agencies about these fraudulent allegations."
"We will ensure that criminals are exposed, and that they are legally accountable for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to the members of my staff," he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Underpowered Rowan Atkinson Spoof Spyof
Understanding the importance of BRIGSIT in any new film with a British outlook has now become a tradition that seems to be a revival of activity – the comedy comedy film company – Johnny Paraglesh, who started in 2003 with Johnny Paraglesh and slowly went back in 2011 with Johnny Paraglesh.
Will ridiculing yourself with a ridiculous imitation of how obviously stupid we are be a new opportunity for the country’s exports?
By the way, Johnny English has a wide-eyed, rubber-faced, inadequate, license to rebuild broken things for the second time - this name is a sign more than anything else that he is a great innovator of humor that is for the English-speaking cinema lands.
He is, of course, the secret agent of the fool who despite his odd ideologies helped to grasp the glamourous little tongue of Clausius, the enthusiasm and taste of the master between a doll and that man with a single note as the song Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He also originally, based on the enigmatic Atkinson traveller and international man once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial that followed chaos.
In Johnny English’s last amusement trip, there are one or two beautiful moments.
I fell in love with that moment when Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the blades of the helicopter wheel slowly moving in front of his hat with a loud head.
Atkinson's gift for a physical comedy is on display, but the humor is generally supplied with inadequate force and strangely unnecessary, especially as "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself can now confidently form a comedy as a matter of fact.
The joke feels like it’s more popular than adults, kids, and I don’t think Johnny English’s distractions are as tempting as Atkinson’s silent-looking film is to be between, creative, and focused on the character.
The persistent issue is that Great Britain is now facing a serious problem.
A cyber thief has infiltrated the UK’s super-secret spy network and revealed the identity of all the UK’s agents in the field, scaring off the task – with little regret for Kevin Aldon.
That’s the last invaluable thing for a prime minister who’s a haunted and turbulent face and is now experiencing a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this super-Terza character, but there’s not much in the script to work on.
His intelligence advisers inform him that if any active spy is revealed, he will have to remove a person from retirement.
And this means that Johnny English Disordered, himself, now works as a school administrator at some charity institutions, but does an out-of-history lesson on how to perform a secret operation: some good loads here, as if English were a preschool with a rock-jack character.
The Englishman returned to White Hall to give the necessary and urgent information and played again with his ex-boyfriend, with his long-suffering Boo, with Miller.
Boo is now a married man and has entered the service as a submarine commander, playing the role of a cheerful wood and a shang-hockey in which the wiki is a bit spoiled.
So, Batman and Robin go back to acting by mistake in Your Highness' secret service again, and Ophia Boltova faces the beautiful face of Ogla Korlenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling under the spell of charismatic tech billionaires who claim to solve the problems of Britain’s computers: the villainous Jason Voltai played by Jack Lacey.
The English and the Boo begin their Odyssey with the clown-like quests: they make themselves as waiters and burn the French restaurant; they beat themselves up and smuggle their own luxury Volt, smuggle them into the house; and the English try to smuggle them into the house when they want to.
Sure, all the stops are meant for the final scene, but as lovely and exciting as it is, there’s about everything on kids’ TV.
It's very medium-sized.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: Can't the British film industry play Roan Atkinson and really do justice to this talent?
The Labour Party has denied plans for the British to work four days a week and receive a five-day salary.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week - but get paid five days.
According to reports, the party wants the company’s employers to transfer the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
This makes employees enjoy a three-day weekend break — but they still come home with the same pay.
Sources said the idea is consistent with the party’s economic agenda and aims to benefit the country for the benefit of workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way to use the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times that a review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits the party's approach to the economic return to the benefit of the workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first party to endorse such an idea, although the Green Party pledged to form a four-day working week during its general election in 2017.
However, this ideal has not yet been endorsed by the Labour Party in general.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day working week is not party politics and is not getting the party’s attention.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to draw his view on a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from “faceless” and “successful” executives in economic firms.
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all of their shares, as the workers' government can make a "discount" for perceived violation reasons.
He also stated that he intends to place workers on the board of directors of companies and create comprehensive ownership funds to hand over 10 percent of the shares of private sector companies to employees, who must earn a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>500 per year.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy to "60 Minutes" on whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Bert Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the office’s findings could lead to any of the Republican senators backing him.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Scott Paulie, a "60 Minutes" reporter, asked the Republicans. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham could the FBI reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open from South Carolina than his colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh when I went to the hearing.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out, he said, "Did you do this?"
He was clear, he was clear, he was clear."
However, it seems that Graham’s vote is unchangeable.
"My mind is full of Bert Kavanaugh's problem, and this will be a high-profile charge," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Graham denied, referring to Kristin Blasi Ford.
“And not everyone who calls on Him can confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I'm not seeing anything new."
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music festival that features a very impressive lineup of stars performing and has just as much an impressive mission; ending global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens’ Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to the large lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardy Bey and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the museum.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was announced in 2012, runs along the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket for this event (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), attendees to the concert must perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call to the venue or any other way of assisting the audience.
But how successful has the global citizen been in 12 years of achieving his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a perfect way to encourage people to take action, or is it just another case of so-called “cliktivism” – people who feel like they’re making a real difference by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Since 2011, the global citizen says he has registered more than 19 million “actions” from his fans and wants to pursue different goals.
The report said the move has helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from its actions that at least $10 billion of it had already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funding provided so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the power of nutrition, the involvement of UK-based investors and practitioners who are committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," and after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, have pledged to be in Rwanda to help end the 35-year-old outbreak of malnutrition.
In April 2018, nutrition power ambassador Tracy Ulman, speaking to the public during a live concert in London, said: "With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens just like you, we can address the social injustice of malnutrition as a potion in history."
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions that demanded the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project called "Power Nutrition" that would reach 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, he asked, “What makes you think we can end up in extreme poverty?”
"This will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Wickham, Shawn Mendes, Cardy B, Janelle Monsey are among some of the actors performing at this year's New York ceremony, hosted by Deborah-Lee France and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for a “marine siege” to prevent Russian energy exports, the interior ministry said.
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinck, quoted by Washington Examiner, as saying that Washington could rely on its Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russia from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zinc claimed that Russia's conflict in Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to discover new energy markets.
"I believe that their presence in the Middle East is an energy broker, as they do in Eastern Europe, and they broker in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the authorities, there are ways and means to fight it.
"The United States has the capacity, together with our naval forces, to ensure that the maritime lines are open and, if necessary, encircling them so that their energy is not transferred to the market," he said.
Zenki spoke to a group of shareholders hosted by the Energy Consumers' Union, a nonprofit group that considers itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s efforts to the way they dealt with Russia and Iran, adding that these efforts were effectively similar to each other.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia, more or less, has influence and fuel substitutes," he said, referring to Russia as "a tempting horse" and adding that its economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements are said to be when the Trump administration, by replacing Russia, is working on its mission to raise the level of its natural gas exports to Europe and provide cheaper options for European consumers.
In this way, Trump administration officials, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump is trying to encourage Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Strategic Pipeline 2 project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin “sir”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $2.11 billion Sterylium Rolling Pipeline, which is expected to build the current pipe capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a completely economical project.
Crimlin stresses that Washington’s peaceful position against the project was only for economic reasons, and this is an example of unhealthy competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after his meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Veeri in September in Moscow, said: "I believe that we have a common view that energy cannot be a means of making choices, that consumers should be able to make choices."
The U.S. involvement has prompted Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project, to take a serious step forward.
The German Industry Advance Foundation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has addressed the United States and said it should avoid European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), Dieter Kempf, said after a recent meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin: “I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply.”
Senator Massachusetts says Elizabeth Warren will think "seriously" about running for president in the 2020 presidential election.
Senator Elizabeth Verin of Massachusetts said on Saturday she would think "seriously" about running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Sharjah Hall in Hollyuk, Senator Virin confirmed that he would think about running.
According to Hill, he said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and build a broken government; it’s only possible if it’s led by a woman.”
"I'm going to think about running for president after November 6."
Pressuring President Donald Trump, he said during a meeting at the Sharjah Salon that “the country is leading this in the wrong direction.
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
In his criticism of Donald Trump and Britt Kavanaugh, Verne has been a clear candidate for the presidency.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before voting."
A poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Vereeniging voters did not think he should run for office in the 2020 election.
According to a global poll by the University of Boston's Political Research Center, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters "probably" said the senator should not share.
Thirty-two percent supported this partnership.
The poll showed more support for the share of Dawl Petrick, the ex-Williams, with the remaining 38 percent supporting the potential share and 48 percent opposing it.
Other top Democratic names discussed in connection with the 2020 election included Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sundries, senator of Vermont.
The press reported that Biden said he would formally decide in January.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSD leaving Palin in Donald Trump's March
Turk Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq before signing up in September.
He was arrested and convicted of a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
Speaking to listeners on the way to Donald Trump in Toledo, Oklahoma said: "While what's happening to my son is happening to him when he comes back, I understand the families who feel the PTSD rifts and the wounds that our soldiers are going back with."
Palin called his arrest "a fiddle in the room" and said his son and the other soldiers "returned a little different but stronger, they returned with the feeling that there was respect for what the soldiers and the air force and every member of the regime had given to the country."
According to Dan Binitt, a spokesman for the Wallace Police Department, she was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and convicted of interfering in a report of domestic violence and gun ownership in a drunken state in connection with the aggression and family harassment of a woman.
18 States, D.C., Support the Challenge of New Asylum Policy
The U.S. State and District of Columbia are facing a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to those who are victims of crime or domestic violence.
NBC News released a summary of a petition filed by representatives of 18 states and counties in Washington on Friday in Washington, D.C., in support of a policy that challenges refugees.
The sessions claim that the American Civil Liberties Union, which collapsed against the federal policy of the House of Commons in August, has yet to be revealed.
He said his partner "and the sons who are members of their brutal group" had harassed him, but U.S. officials rejected his application for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who support Grace said El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have the highest number of asylum seekers in the U.S. as these countries are facing gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy reversed the 2014 U.S. Immigration Board decision that allowed undocumented migrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
General Carl Rossin, of the Sarnval District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
According to the petition, the court "requires that all applications for asylum based on the specific facts and circumstances of the application be arbitrated, and such impediments violate this principle."
In the summary, the lawyers stressed that the policy of preventing immigrants from entering the U.S. economy hurts, adding that they may be in business and "provide the necessary wages."
In June, General Jeff's Sarnwal session ordered immigration judges not to give more refuge to those fleeing family harassment and gang violence.
On 11 June, the UN Security Council declared that "asylum is for those who may have left their country out of fear of death on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social or political group."
Asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face in their daily lives.
Rescue efforts in Palu have doubled as the death toll has doubled in search of survivors.
The situation for the survivors was steadily worse.
Risa Kasma, a 35-year-old mother who was soothing her feverish son at one of the evacuation centers in the city below Palo, said it was "a sad feeling."
"Every minute an ambulance brought the bodies here.
Drinking water is scarce.”
The inhabitants were seen returning to their desolate homes, dragging their possessions out of the water, trying to save what they could.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals were filled with wounds by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
Some of the wounded, including two Harris, whose back and shoulder had been broken, lay outside Palu's military hospital, where the patients were being treated for severe and persistent earthquakes.
When she saw the sensation of the intense earthquake that shook the fifth room of the hotel he lived in with his wife and daughter, she was filled with tears.
“It wasn’t the time to save our lives.
Harris told Ashesh Peres that "I was squeezed between the ruins of the walls, I think," and added that his family had gone to the city to join a wedding convention.
"I heard the voice of my lady crying for help, but later I heard the silence.
I don’t know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Mocking’ with ‘Advertising Announcements’
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper to advertise for U.S.-China trade benefits, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to publish propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, after accusing China of being interested in interfering in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, allegations that China rejects, cited a Chinese newspaper as citing the additional costs of dispatch to the best-selling newspaper.
Trump's allegations that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. election showed what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new stage in Washington's campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish their announcements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that has seen tariffs rise above each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts said China’s punitive tariffs at the beginning of the war were designed to target exporters in states like Lua, which is backed by the Republican Party of John Trump.
U.S. Ambassador to China and long-term Governor of the former Loa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, Terry Burnstead, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, peasants and businesses.
Branstead wrote in a commentary in the Disney Moines Register on Sunday, "China is now doubling the ridicule by launching propaganda announcements, in our own free media."
Branstead wrote, "By exacerbating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the tradition of free speech of the United States and our free media, by publishing announcements in the Des Moines Register."
"On the contrary, in the downside newsroom here in Beijing, you will see the limited voices of opposition and you will not see the real reflection of the different theories that the Chinese people may have about the path of economic involvement, with the fact that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers in the publication of his article went unnoticed," although he did not mention the newspaper's name.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating women voters before the midterm elections with the horror of Kunova.
While a large number of Republicans are defending the position of Britt Kuvana, the strongest candidate against a large number of allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have warned that they will face serious reactions, especially from women, during the upcoming election.
The level of emotion in this case has been too high, and a large number of Republicans on the list show that they wanted to go ahead with voting.
Grant Richer, a professor of law at Syracuse University's Maxiville School of Law in Hill, said in an article that appeared on Saturday, "Drain's sort of withdrawal issues can't take place."
Richard said he doubted the Senate’s last-minute attempt by Jeff Felix to say that the FBI’s investigation was sufficient to calm voter anger.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Crane Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November.”
On Friday morning, protesters, as they passed through the Delhi Senate, shouted "November is not coming!" as the Republicans controlled the judiciary committee they elected to run for Quanu's nomination, according to Dr. Beyddi.
Seto Rodinberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site, "Democratic interest will be out of the box,"
"People say it's already reached the heights, that's the truth.
But it can get higher, especially among women voters in cities and young voters, 18-29 years old, who don’t like the president, usually don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony on the details of the sexual harassment allegations against the prosecution’s candidate, analysts recommended that if Republicans tried to confirm it, reactions might take place.
According to NBC News, Michelle Steele, the former chairman of the National Republican Committee, said earlier last week, “This has created a big mess for the GOP.”
Guy Cincinnati, the head of U.S. priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel, "It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote whether Kavanaugh will be put on the seat, it's about the way Republicans have handled it."
However, Americans seem to believe to some extent in a gang that believes in Ford and his testimony against Kavanaugh, with little inclination towards Kavanaugh.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 feeds said they thought Kuana might have lied during the testimony, while only the other 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After an effort by Flick, the FBI has now begun its investigation into charges filed by Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford swore before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had harassed him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez is accused of being a stiff genitals candidate while showing him that they were in a convent at the time of their education in Yale in 1980.
The discovery of the World Wide Web has plans to launch a new Internet to reach with Google and Facebook.
Tim Burner-Lee, a global Internet explorer, is taking his first steps towards competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest Genius of Technology project, Inrupt, is the company that creates the Solid Burner open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their information is stored and when they are allowed to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Barners-Lee joked that his goal was behind Inrupt's "domination of the world."
He said about his first steps, "We've got to do this now."
“This is a historic moment.”
Using Solid technology, this tool allows people to create their own “personal online information store” or POD.
This store includes lists, lists of things to do, gender, music, library, and other personal and professional items.
This is in the form of a drive cheat, Microsoft Otlock, Silk and Satisfaction, all available in one brush and at the same time.
What’s special about an online personal information store is that it’s entirely about the user who can have access to that information.
The company called it the "personal empowerment through information."
The Inrupt Theory, based on the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to put together the right resources, trends, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now has Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform provided by IBM, a number of contract employees who have been deployed to work on the project, and a committee of volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized tools, using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Barners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking about "Facebook and Google about making a total change, where other business models were created in the blink of an eye."
“We don’t want permission.”
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "The Inrupt mission is to provide commercial and ecosystem energy to help with the coherence and quality of the new web that has been created in Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee formed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a pervasive voice in impartial conversations.
Even at the opening of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and chairman of the Global Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Information Institute.
Berners-Lee added, "I'm incredibly optimistic about the new era of the web."
Bernard Van: Victory was celebrated by the clergy of the WW1 Cross
Winning the Victorian Cross in World War I has been celebrated as a fighter in his hometown for 100 years by the only pastor of the Church of England.
Second Colonel, the Honourable Bernard van der Waal, took the prize on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bilinglis and Lehicourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew that he had made the greatest military honor of his life.
From a memorial stone by his two nephews to Saturday, the curtain was removed in the realm of Roushaddin.
One of his grandchildren, Michelle Van, said it was "shiny in its symbolic form" and should have been displayed exactly 100 years ago, the day his fathers won the award.
According to the London Journal, on September 29, 1918, Colonel van der Waal crossed his army through the St. Quentin Canal "through thick dust and under heavy gunfire."
He then went to the line of fire and, before taking the gun with one hand and turning three sides, took the line forward with "a lot of courage."
Colonel Vonn was killed by a German gunman on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michelle Vonn, 72, said her father's actions were "something I could never do, but it's a humble thing."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also presented a bouquet of flowers after the show, which was led by the Brintood Imperial Youth Band.
Michelle Van said she was "very proud that it was just this show" and added that "the delight of a true hero is being shown with the support of a lot of people."
The MMA signals stayed all night to see the Bilator 206, but instead they saw the Pipa Peg.
Imagine that you waited all night to see the Bilator 206, just to prevent you from seeing the original program.
The St. Joseph Bill consisted of 13 fights, including 6 fights in the main squad, which was to be broadcast all night from Channel 5 in England.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gagard Moussassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, British viewers were shocked when the live broadcast became Pipa Pag.
Some viewers were not pleased after waking up all night for the first hours of the day to watch the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter called the change from live broadcast to cartoon children a "unpleasant joke."
When asked about the transfer, Def Squartz, deputy chief marketing and communications officer at Bilator, said, "It's government regulation that that content wasn't appropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to broadcast the children's program."
"""Ten feet,""" yes."""
Scott Cooke, president of Bilator, said they were going to work on splitting the time to keep the viewers of the UK with them in the future.
Cocker said, "I think when I think about the answer, I think we might be able to solve it."
"But it's Sunday at 6:00 a.m. and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday at our own time, Monday at their own time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this change occurred, I witnessed a lot of messages going up and down, and all of those messages weren't very friendly.
We tried to solve this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was the government’s problem.
I can promise you that this will not happen in the future.
We will bring the number of fights down from six to five – as usual – and we have tried to show the number of fights to those who are interested, and hence the number of fights has increased.
This is a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dolly feels 'fromaniac' in relation to sex
Olympic diving champion Tom Dolly says he grew up feeling depressed in front of everyone because of his gender — but this encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize "everyone's not like me" when he went to high school.
Speaking to Radio 4 Desks of the Desert Island, which was presented by Laurence Leverney, she talked about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He said becoming a father made him think less about winning the Olympics.
Christy Young, who is on a long-term schedule due to illness, has taken a few months off.
While appearing alone in Laurie's first show, Deli said she felt "less than others" growing up, because "it was unacceptable in society that she loved both a boy and a girl."
"To this day, it has been the feeling of being inferior to others and the feeling of being different from the real things that has given me the strength and the power to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something" until everyone knew about his sexual desires, not to be disappointed by him.
The Olympic medalist has been one of the big promoters of LGBT and has used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask other countries not to consider homosexuality a crime.
He said he talked about it because he felt happy to live without divisions and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time World Champion said he fell in love with a man - the American filmmaker, Diana Lance Black, whom they met in 2013 - "took me by surprise."
Deli was married to an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than her, but he said the difference in life has never been a problem.
He talked about his first Olympics, which was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - "when you're going through a lot of trouble in a short life," he said it was difficult for him to find someone whose experiences were similar in posts and heights of life.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Voy Black-Delhi, who said that "his whole view" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, the only thing I'd say would be to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things in life than gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby.”
His son’s name is similar to his father’s name, who died at the age of 40, in 2011 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said her father did not accept that she would die, and one of the last things she asked him was to buy my picks for London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit on the first train.
He said, "I couldn't tell him you wouldn't survive until you sat on the first train, Dad."
"I held his hand firmly when he breathed and I kept on doing it, and when he stopped breathing, I finally knew he wasn't invincible," she said.
The following year, Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the Bronze Medal.
"I just knew that's what I've dreamed of all my life, dreaming up in front of people at the Olympics, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
This fact was also the motivation for his first song - proud of the little scrub stick - which was tuned in with him to prepare for the Olympics and even now stands his body hair.
The Desert Island Disc will air on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 a.m. on Sunday.
Mickleson was out of style on Saturday, sitting on the Reader's Cup chair.
American Phil Mickleson will close the record by Sunday when he plays the 47th Raiders Cup, but he has to reverse his style to avoid an unfavorable outcome.
Mickleson, who plays the tournament once every two years for the 12th time, was appointed to the chair by Captain Jim Forrick for his four multiple balls on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as he has usually played for the United States, the winner spent five big races of his half-day as an encouragement and another half as a hope for what helped him in his game.
A man who has never been a regular runner, even at the peak of his career, has never been a good fit for the tough Lee Golf Nationals, where long-term hardships are punished unpleasantly every day.
And, of course, the course itself is not as horrifying as it is, during its ninth race on Sunday, Mickleson faces the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win four races this week.
If the Americans, in the beginning of the 12 singles race, scored four points less and started a warm-up, the Mickleson race could prove to be a real emergency.
Firke expressed confidence in his man, not as much as he said anything.
Firki said, "He knew his role well today and put his hand on my shoulder and took his arm away from my neck and said he would be ready tomorrow."
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He’s famous and has been very close to these teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn’t play him in the game.
I expected more of him, but that’s what happened and that’s what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there just like everyone else.”
Michaelson will defeat Richard Nick Faldo for the most games played by Sunday.
This could be the end of his career at Cape Reader, which has never been the same as his highest singles record.
Michaelson won 18, lost 20, and lost seven semi-slave and semi-lost races, although Firck said his existence had brought untangible gains to the team.
"He's a character joker, he's a mocker and a joker, he likes to joke with people and he's a great man to have on the team," he said.
"I think the young players have had a happy time going over him, which is something interesting to see.
He's given a lot more than just playing."
Thomas Bejuran, a European captain, knows that a great leader could soon disappear.
Thomas Bejuren, a European captain, knows from his experience that a leader-scored approach to the final day of the singles race at the Ryder Cape can easily be taken on an annoying path.
Dean started his first game in 1997 at Voldirama, where the one-sided captain was scored by Seo Bastiros, who scored five points against the Americans but won the final line with the least difference, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
When he was photographed after winning 3-5 classes in 2018 on Friday and yesterday, resulting in Lee's 6-10, he said, "You remember we were at the top level at Parreirama; we were at the top level at Brooklyn, we were at the top level where we lost, and we were at Walmart."
So history has shown me and everyone in this team that it’s not over yet.
You will be born again tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It won't end until you've scored your score.
“We have a goal, and it’s to try to get this award out of it, and that’s what we need to focus on.
"I've always repeated, I'm focusing on the 12 players who play for us, but we still know who's standing in front of us - the best players in the world."
While he was delighted that his players had played hard on the golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never be ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is another animal.
Tomorrow is a solo show that's okay and something different.
It's great to be there with a partner who's doing well, but when you're alone, you'll be tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is a message you have to share with your players, show the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind, he too must go and show off his best."
Unlike Bejorn, Jim Ferk, the number-one opposite of his players, will want them to shine better solo than playing with their partner, with Jordan Sputnik and Justin Thomas being more expected to score three points, including four.
Firki himself worked hard at the end of the last two big days with the change of prostitutes, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before losing because Europe pulled out of the "miracle in the city".
In response to a question about how the captain relied on his players in 1999 and went to the final day, he said, "I remember every damn word of it."
"We have 12 important races tomorrow, but people want to go to the same fast start, as you saw in Brooklyn, or as you saw in the city.
When the stage goes one way, there is a lot of pressure on the middle races.
“We’re setting our line in the same way that we’re putting the players in the way we want them to, you know, we’re trying to get a little bit of magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and will compete in the higher race, with Rory McLaury, and in the upper half races with other Europeans, Paul Cassie, Justin Day, Jonah Way, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pollard.
"I chose this group of men in this way because I think it's covering the whole track," he said.
The German warship was once again postponed.
The local media reported that the newest German naval force had to start operations in 2014 to replace a Cold War-era warship, but the ship would not start operations by next year due to problems with the system and the use of snowballs.
According to a military spokesman, the start of the Rhineland-Palatinate activity has been postponed, according to the Daily Zeet newspaper, by the big brand new Badin-Whiteberg-class Elly second-half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-transition problems have led to a shift in the future of the big project.
Four Whiteberg-class vessels were ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the ship with the Brimin-class aging vessel.
It is known that they will showcase strong balls, total anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and a number of covert technologies such as radar, infrared and reduced sound signals.
Other important facilities include long periods of maintenance – it should be possible to send the newest ships away from inland ports, for two-year missions.
Dai Zait points out that although it is said that lasting delays would mean that the rushing warships that would allow Germany to plan its foreign missions would be expiring from the start of service.
The unsuccessful warship F125 was among the titles of last year, when the German navy officially prevented the ship from being deployed and handed over to the sales ship Blum & Wes in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the ship-maker after its transfer.
There is not enough information on the reasons for the ship's return, but German media have pointed to a number of "software and hardware problems" that have made it useless if it were sent for a combat mission.
The inadequacy of the software was especially important because the Badin-Wittertmiger-class ships would be led by a group of 120 soldiers - the only half of the human forces active on the previous Bermuda warship.
Furthermore, the fact emerged that the ship was significantly more than weighted, which makes it less active and limits the ability of naval forces to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate ship arrives as it moves, weighing twice as much as the ship that Germany used during World War II.
Regardless of the inadequate hardware, the cost of all the project - including employee training - was also problematic.
It is said to cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion more than expected.
Problems on the newest warship are important, especially in light of the recent threats of a shrinking German navy.
Earlier in the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the naval forces were facing "small ships capable of going on missions."
The official said the problem had grown with time because the old ships had been decommissioned, but no other ship had been set up to replace it.
He explained that none of the warships of the Vertimberg-class were able to join the navy.
The National Fund has listened to the mysterious life of bats.
New research has begun at one of the Scottish Highlands Centers to find out how bats use scenery to hunt their food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the rare procedures of flying mammals and help to pave the way for conversational activities of these creatures.
The research, launched by scientists at the National Fund for Scotland, will continue to track normal and soprano-pipistroliz mice, as well as brown-eared and dubinton mice, in the real-day Inverness gardens.
Special recorders will be moved to key positions in the garden to record activities during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also try to launch mobile services using handheld cranes.
Audio expert analysis will determine all the recorded frequencies of bat conversations and what kind of things they do.
Subsequently, a habitat map and report will be created to give a picture of their procedure in detail on the scale of the scene.
Rob Devor, Nature Talks Advisor for NTS, hopes the result will show which parts of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each of their species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management, such as creating grasslands and how forests can be kept for bats and other species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined dramatically over the past century.
As a result of the construction of buildings and expansion activities, they are at risk of losing their habitat.
Northern and illuminating turbines can also pose a risk, as can toxic papers and a number of other chemical spices used in home buildings, and attacks by household towels.
Mosquitoes are not actually blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, in the sense of food, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use complex biolocation techniques to remove insects and other obstacles along their flight paths.
NTS, which takes care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the existence of bats seriously.
The foundation has 10 trained cacologists who carry out services, night inspections, and some rescue missions on a regular basis.
The foundation has even created the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in the Trief Building in Daphne and Galloway, which includes ten species, including eight species of Scottish bats.
The manager of the David Thomson Building says this is the place for them to come up with an idea.
He said, "Here at Trip, we've created the best area for bats."
"We have considered old buildings, a lot of old trees, and a whole good habitat.
"But there are a lot of things that haven't come to light about bats, and what we're doing here and at other foundations will help us learn about what they're doing to succeed."
He stressed the importance of looking for mice, before building buildings, because the potential for unwanted damage to a single nest could kill as many as 400 female and young mice and perhaps the entire local population.
Mosquitoes are protected and killing, harassing or harassing them or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferriel, a Scottish officer for the Mouse Conservation Fund, has encouraged people to help.
"We still have a long way to go to learn about bats, and for a large number of bat species, we don't even know their populations are arguing with life.
Ronaldo denies allegations of sexual assault when lawyers prepare to file a case against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of sexual assault against him “fake news” and said people “want to advertise for themselves using his name.”
His lawyers are ready to file a complaint against the German magazine, Late Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Forrest Portugal and Juntos have been charged with sexually assaulting an American woman named Katherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Spoiler reported late on Friday that he was accused of later paying the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
While he spoke to 142 million people on Instagram after the allegation was reported, the 33-year-old reacted to the report, calling it "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time winner said in front of his waist.
“They want to advertise for themselves using my name.
This is normal.
They want to get famous by mentioning my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is going well,” the player added with a kiss on his lips.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s defense attorneys are preparing to complain about Spiegel’s delay in addressing the allegations that he has made reports of unacceptable suspicions in the area of confidentiality.
Attorney Christine Seartz said the player "demands moral damages in response to a serious violation that may be one of the more serious personal rights violations in recent years."
It is said that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in the Las Vegas-based Hotel Pams and Cosnoi.
According to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he raped him from behind.
Myerga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident, saying that he was "99 percent" a "good man" and said to leave "another one percent" aside.
The documents claim that Ronaldo acknowledged that he had slept with the woman, but this was done by agreement from both sides.
Myrga continues to claim that she went to the police and had pictures of her wounds taken in the hospital, but later expressed satisfaction with the out-of-court agreement because she felt "fear of retribution" and worried about "being impoverished against the people."
The 34-year-old woman says she has now rejected the agreement because she was traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the sexual assault charge, Ronaldo was due to leave Manchester United and join the Madrid Railroad, and in the summer, he joined Italy's Giannis Jof for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Britain's Brexit could be 'always regretted' by the loss of motorists
Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark said that if Britain lost its position as the world leader in motorcycle production after Brexit, it would remain "forever regrettable."
He added that "it was a matter of concern" that the UK's Toyota told the BBC that if the UK quit the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily halt its production at the Bernaston plant near Late.
Mr. Clark said, "We need a deal."
Japan's motor manufacturer said the impact of the incentives on the border during Brexit without a deal could result in compulsory costs.
The Bernaston factory - which is a manufacturer of Toyota Aris and Evins engines - produced nearly 150,000 engines over the past year, with 90% of it exported to other Arab countries.
Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bernaston, said: "I think the UK will leave the European Union at the end of March and we will see production stop at our factory."
Other UK manufacturers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about leaving the EU without a deal on how overseas trade will operate.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its small self-propelled factory in Oxford for the month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what motorists say will be the risks of supply chains during the no-contract Brexit.
Toyota's production line has been "very timely," with engines delivered in 37 days from other suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal by March 29, there could be disruptions at the borders, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to wait for more days than the cost of inventory at its long-standing factory and stop production.
Mr Clarke said that Tracy's plan for future contacts with the EU was "precisely calibrated to prevent these checks from taking place at the borders."
"We need a contract. He told BBC Radio 4 today, "We want to have the best contract so that, as we say, we can not only serve as ambassadors but also take advantage of this opportunity."
“Evidence from not just Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we need to be able to fully sustain our chain of supply.”
Toyota could not say when it would stop producing, but warned in the long run that the added costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and, as a result, reduce the number of job opportunities.
Peter Quovarris, who has worked at the Bernaston factory for 24 years and is the organiser of the Union Union in the factory, said that members of the union are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these job opportunities are lost, they will not come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a detailed and credible plan for our future communications with the EU."
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
The White House said on Sunday that Trump's high-profile meetings with Rosenstein's deputy Sarnwal may once again be postponed for "another week" as controversies continue over star candidate Britt Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein is responsible for overseeing the work of the Robert Mueller Special Council, which assesses Russia’s interference in the election, Trump’s assistance to Russia, and the potential prevention of the president’s justice.
Whether or not Trump removes deputy Louis Sarnwal, putting Mueller’s independence at risk, has been causing a number of shortcomings in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that the wearing of Mike by Rosenstein was discussed in order to record his conversation with Trump and the possibility of redressing the president through Rosenstein’s 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But he went to the White House last Monday, during the release of reports about his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was postponed for Thursday due to the president’s signature at the United Nations summit in New York.
Dr. Christine Blasi Ford said Trump would "not prefer" to remove Rosenstein, but the meeting to avoid collusion with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him behaved inappropriately, and both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump issued a one-week investigation warrant by the FBI against the charges against Kavanaugh, which also postponed the Senate Supplemental Vote.
Trump's media secretary, Sarah Sundries, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
In response to a question about Rosenstein, he said: "History has not yet been determined, it may be during this week, I can see that given all the things that are going on in the fort, this meeting may be postponed for another week.
But we see and we always like to make the media aware of the news."
Some reporters may object to the allegation: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the information was not according to the taste of the TV reporters and said of course it was "attractive". "I do not object to the fact that the information was attracting attention."
He then said direct media ties with Trump would increase.
Without providing any evidence, he said, "The president holds more question-and-answer meetings than any previous president," "We've looked at the statistics."
He said: "If the media get a chance to raise their questions about the United Nations directly with the president, it would be better than talking to me.
We will try to do this, and you have seen us do this over the past few weeks, and the meeting where you can talk to the President about the United Nations will be the replacement of the press conference."
Trump responds to questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with other officials.
There are very few individual press conferences.
Over the course of the week in New York City, the president showed why by taking the style of the media and sometimes looking inappropriate to reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns.
The Minister has written to EU employees working in the NHS Scotland to express the legitimacy of the country and wish it would be Brexit afterwards.
Jane Freeman sent the MSP a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government is already committed to paying the cost of relocation status applications for EU citizens working in the public sector.
Mrs. Freeman wrote in the letter: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal of this union have been ongoing and are heading towards an expected decision in the treasury.
But the UK government is still prepared for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this may be a rough time for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to tell you how much each employee’s contribution, regardless of their identity, is worth to me.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond have brought us valuable experience and skills that have helped to foster and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and the community we serve.
Scotland is a very old house and we really want you to stay here."
Kristin Abierkrumbi goes to surgery after a head injury.
Mike Oregon, speaking on behalf of the Tennessee State Tigers, said Titans line defender Christine Abierkrumbi underwent emergency surgery after she lost 27-31 to Winderbitt Commodore on Sunday.
Tennessee State's senior coach, Rhode Reed, told reporters that he was injured shortly after the half-match.
Reed said, "He came to the sideline and fell there,"
Teachers and medical staff on the sidelines gave her oxygen before she was noticed and transferred for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, said Abiercrombie had been expelled from the Winderbury Medical Center's surgical room.
Harris added that "there's no more information on the type/size of the wound," and Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Ambercrombie, the red t-shirt after the transfer from Illionius, is in line with its first season in Tennessee State.
On Saturday, he had a total of five fights before his departure, bringing his season-long mental struggles to 18.
When buying a building in the UK, foreign buyers will have to pay more taxes.
Under the new plan, when buying a building in the UK, foreign buyers will have to pay more taxes and extra money to help the homeless.
This will neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
Increasing the use of the tax cap will result in tariffs for those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The fund is expected to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year – to help the homeless.
Tracy Mai will announce today that foreign buyers, when they buy property in the UK, will get more of the use of the top tax - with extra money to help our homeless people.
This will be used as an effort to counteract the Korbyn crime movement to attract young voters with promises of affordable homes while targeting high-income individuals.
A tax cap in the form of tariffs on people and factories that do not pay taxes in the UK will be imposed with an additional bridge that will increase the ability of the government to deal with homeless people.
The additional costs - which in addition to the current tax cap, including the high levels of costs incurred two years ago in the case of second homes and permits for purchase - could be as much as three percent.
The Treasury is expected to grow to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year.
Estimates of 13 new London buildings in the 20th century have been implemented by uninhabited residents in London, which has led to price hikes and a challenge to first-class home buyers.
A large number of the country's wealthy areas - especially in the city center - have been transformed into a "ghost town" because of foreign buyers, who spend a lot of time abroad.
A new policy was introduced a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help more young people buy their first home.
He has accused large construction companies of keeping the price of the property up, raising the price of the land, saying they would not use it, and asked the woman to abolish the shares of affordable homes to solve the "none-houses."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed a series of considered housing reforms, including controlling rents and ending the "non-trivial" evacuations.
He also wants to give more authority to the council to build new houses of relief.
"I said last year that I would dedicate my prime ministership to fulfilling the English dream, and that life should be better for each of the new generations.
And that means building a broken market for detached homes.
Brittany will always be open to those who want to live, work and revive their lives here.
However, it can't be true that it's easier for those who don't live in the UK and still have companies based abroad to work hard in the UK.
The dream of buying a home has been too far away for a lot of people, and being homeless is also a reality.”
Jack Russo: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland President Jack Russ says my “last ambition” is to run Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish, third-placed in League One with only three points less than the highest, enjoys the challenge of reviving the Nord-East Club.
He joined the lighthouse this summer after he led St. Mary's again to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won the B-Cup and that's it," he told the BBC's Scottish squad.
"But I grew up as a child with my father, by observing Scotland in hamptons, and that's something that has always dragged me back.
This opportunity will only come once, though, if I win in the club office.”
The parents of the day are Schmelz Nick Eddock, David Moses, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Goose Poitiers, and Paolo DiCanio.
Former president Alva Atlantic says he feels he is not afraid of chasing such names in such a big club, while Barnesley and Ipswich have already rejected the proposals.
"Achievement for me at the moment is driven by the scale of 'Can I relinquish this club to the top league?'
Due to the structure and facilities in this club, it is undoubtedly related to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I might only see myself successful here if I take the club back with them."
After working as a deputy chairman at Dumbarton and only 15 months at Coach Gary Hertz, Russia has been in office for three years.
He then helped with Alva to prevent the fall to the third row, and in the following season, turned St. Mary's from the threshold of the fall to the title of champion.
And Russia says it feels more comfortable now than it has done in the course of its game at Celtic, Hartlepool, Fall Creek, St. Mary's and Hamilton.
He remembered a time when he took charge of Alva's "Maybe it was a real foursome,"
“I really believed that the office was more than just playing, it was just right for me.
This is strange because I did well, so I built a good life for myself and enjoyed a number of high-ranking positions as well.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to endure week after week.
I’m still suffering from stress and stress, but I feel like I’m in the right place.
I’ve always wanted to be in the office and now I’m doing it, I feel like I’ve been more comfortable than ever during my adult life.”

The summer heatwave has increased the level of visits to bars in the Battle of Brighton, but it has put more pressure on the chains of the Rustians.
According to the figures, bar groups and bars saw a 2.7 per cent increase in July - but visits to restaurants fell to 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business advisor who complained about the statistic, said: "The unprecedented long-running sunshine of England at the World Cup has caused the July model to be the same as last month, with bars witnessing a 2.8-century increase in turnover.
The 1.8-century decline in the restaurant business continued to worsen during the month of June.
Bars and large alcohol bars have had their strongest performance so far, more than restaurants whose business had declined.
Food restaurants were also harmed by the existence of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink alcohol.
Sales of alcohol in all bars and pubs reached 6.6% this month and fell to 3% in restaurants.
Paul Newman, RSM’s entertainment and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social and sporting events, including major sales factors in the out-of-home market, are significant.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, though a 4.8 percent drop in annual sales is painful, especially in the face of persistent cost pressures.
A long, warm summer for food service providers could not have been worse than this, and time itself will prove whether we can get the experience of lower temperatures in August to get the required rest."
Total sales growth across bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the list of brands.

One in five children has hidden social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are 11 years old, have opened secret social media accounts that they have hidden from their parents and teachers.
The service of 20,000 high school students appeared on the pages of "Fake-Insta."
This news has created fears about the sexual content that the skin seeks out.
Twenty percent of the disciples said they had a “principal” account to show to their parents.
One in five children - some of whom reach the age of 11 - have created social media accounts that they have hidden from adults.
The 20,000-year-old high school student service revealed that rapid growth has occurred in "false-insta" accounts - the Instagram site, a reference for sharing photos.
This news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
One-hundred percent of the students said they were using their own "main" account to show their parents while they also had other secret accounts.
A mother who learned about the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found out that the teenager was asking others to "rape me."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Teachers' Conference (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two accounts, and half of those keep their accounts secret.
HMC Chairman Mike Bohnen said: "It's disappointing that a large number of teenagers are tempted to create an online space where their parents and teachers can't be found.
Ellie Doyle will be the "Athlete's Voice" on the Atlantic Board of Scotland
Ellie Doyle was elected non-executive chairman of the Scottish Atlantic Board at the annual general meeting of the Government Office.
Doyle, one of the most eclectic athletes in the field and the chairman of the bite, called the move a great opportunity to guide others into the sport that can benefit from his extensive experience at the international level.
“Ellyde is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK, and the world’s athlete community, and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will benefit a lot from bringing him to the stage,” he said.
Doyle said: “I am interested in acting as a voice for athletes and I hope that I can really contribute to Scotland’s sport and help in the leadership sector.”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, is currently a BBC patron who was unable to walk after suffering a schematic attack.
He tweeted, “I had a stroke a month before today.
I was not able to walk.
The doctors said that only a passing of time could tell if I would be cured and how much.
It was awkward, but I recovered and learned how to walk, and today I can do agile drills!
"Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The announcement of the breast pump, which gave birth to cows, has divided the theory into two parts.
A breast pump company has divided online theories into two parts in connection with announcements that milk mothers are being milked by cows that are being slaughtered.
In order to reopen what’s called the “first breast pump off,” consumer technology company Elvy has released an interesting music video inspired by the announcement that represents the freedom the new pump gives expressive mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow-filled pantry for a song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I'm learning myself, but you don't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed that these are mammals, these are my breasts."
The song continues: “Pump it, pump it, dear ones, I’m feeding them, pump it, pump it, I’m feeding my wives.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of theories, this video has received different reactions from viewers, many have said that the announcement sheds light on the "terror" of the dairy industry.
"To announce this production, the use of cows has been a bad decision.
"They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth to babies so that they can produce milk, except for their babies, which are stolen from them a few days after birth."

Another commented: "Equally understandable is harmful to the mother and baby.
But yes, why shouldn’t he use it to announce a breast pump to mothers who have to take care of their own children?”
Another added: “What a far cry from feeling.”
Others have defended the announcement, a woman has even accepted that the song was "smiling".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I were still 10 milks, I’d probably buy one for myself.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
This announcement is a little crazy, but I pointed it out for what it is.
Someone wrote, “This is a great product.”
Another commented: “This is an interesting announcement aimed at women who pump (usually at work or swimming) and feel like they are ‘cows’.
This is not a statement that judges or praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they dance with a pump installed on their chest straps.
The main concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that a large number of women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
Although the Elvis pump is completely off, it has no cable or tube and moves inside the nursing belt, giving the woman the freedom to take her children wherever she wants to go, and even when they pump, they go outside.
Anna Blairin, partner and ECD at Mother, wrote: "The Elvish Pump is a revolutionary product that deserves such a bold and stimulating opening.
By creating an equality between expressive women and dairy cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and all the related challenges, while we wanted to portray it in an interesting way, by providing the feeling of freedom that is created by using this pump.
This isn't the first time that Eliot's pumps have been used by the media.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two was seen showing off the product while wearing Martha Jacobuski.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved Silently to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has increased despite the unchanged crossing of borders, as the Trump administration’s harsh tone and policies have made it harder to hand over children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and by sponsoring a child, they were able to put themselves in danger in the country.
The threats were heightened when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and adult family members would need to register their fingerprints, and the information would be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Albinis, the senior official for immigration and customs administration, was summoned before Congress because the agency had arrested a large number of people who had applied to sponsor refugee children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the people arrested had no criminal history.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of the sponsors live illegally, and many of them are criminal aliens.
We will continue to pursue these people,” Mr. Elbins said.
According to Steiner, officials who want to bring the children into the process earlier have introduced new rules, some of which require them to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days after the benchmark was passed.
Many, instead of being physically present, came to the court via video call to apply for legal status in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify will be returned to their homeland.
According to Shelter employees and reports that have been circulated from the system over the past few months, as much as children are in custody, they are just as anxious or depressed as they are causing violent intuition or trying to escape.
Lawyers have said that these concerns are more widespread in larger foundations such as Tornillo, where the children who try are often thought to be ignored because of their size.
They added that moving children to a tent town, without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally and say goodbye to their friends, could be a blow to them that many of these children are already facing.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" to leave immediately
In a statement to the United Nations General Council, Secretary of State Walid al-Mahram appealed to Syrian immigrants to return to the country, although the country’s war is taking place in its eighth year.
The teacher, who continues to serve as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegally in existence on the pretext of fighting terrorism and “will be treated the same way.”
He told the council, “They must be released immediately and unconditionally.”
The teacher stressed that "the war on terror in Syria is almost over," where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions more left homeless since 2011.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight against this holy war until we have cleared our lands of terrorist groups and foreign illegal entities.
The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to advise and train its forces, and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad are in the shower.
Thousands of French troops are stationed in the country.
Regarding the issue of migrants, the teacher said the situation was better for them to return, and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading fear" to encourage migrants to leave.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian aid foundations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They make things that need to be completely humanitarian politically.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that if a political deal between Assad and the opposition is not made at the end of the war, there will be no building aid for Syria.
The U.N. diplomat says the recent agreements between Russia and Turkey to establish an intermediary zone in the area of Idlib’s last major rebel group have provided an opportunity for negotiation.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented widespread harassment by Russian-backed Syrian forces in a province where millions of people live.
Although the teacher stressed that the agreement had "clear aggression" and said he hoped to target jihadist military operations, including al-Nusra-linked fighters, to "root" al-Qaida.
U.N. Representative Stephen De Mistura hopes that the first new committee meetings, which will be a combination of government and opposition members, will begin to prepare the post-war law for the series and pave the way for elections.
The teacher provided the conditions for the government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to "referring to the current provisions of the law" and warned against interference.
Why will Trump win the second round?
With this logic in mind, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election if, as a large number of liberals hope, the impeachment and disgrace of his presidency does not end before the end of this round.
What is undoubted is that “this will be one of the brightest presidential endings!”
However, there are no signs of fatigue so far.
Since 2014, therefore, prime-time ratings of 1.05 million on CNN have more than doubled and 1.6, tripled on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million Prime Time viewers, more than 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC's "Rachel Maudo" program with cable ratings to 3.5 million viewers on the big news nights ranked it number one.
Neil Bayer, director of ABC’s “Remaining Determined” drama, which is about a cabinet minister appointed as president after an attack on the center, said, “It’s a fire where people are burned because that’s not what we understand.”
Neil Squill, an ex-comedy writer and author of "Only Funny Parts: And A Few Facts About Heading to the Hollywood Kids' Club," has another theory.
He remembers his trip to Texas in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked, why?
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Ms. Squill said.
There’s a value to entertainment in this mess.
Of course, unlike other programs on television, the headlines of articles coming out of Washington could see the future on his video, whether immigrant families can join forces and pinpoint the health of the global economy.
It is a blessing that can only be granted to the most discerning of people.

I, alone, will never see the same Supermare.

When I visited Mr. Felice this week, on a sunny day 80 degrees outside of his home in North Waikiki, he was sitting inside his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not turn himself away, nor that Barit Kavanaugh was to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and that the future of Stare was firmly involved on this scale.
Mr. Felice said to me, "I remember when we were running crazy programs back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"

Outside the flood of money in the tightest home elections in the medium term
It’s not surprising that the 17th of Pennsylvania witnessed a flood of money, thanks to a congressional reshuffle of districts that made the two factors for an inclusive race chair.
The rewrite of the Pittsburgh suburb of the Pizza District was done by Karner Lemp on behalf of the Democrats - who had made a seat in another district in the special election last spring.
Long, unlike the other candidate, is Republican Kate Rotfoss, who is currently representing the 12th district of the former Pennsylvania, which is heavily intertwined with the new 17th district.
The plans will then be rewritten by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January, according to which former districts have been illegally merged in favour of Republicans.
The current situation has led to a financial campaign between the Big Financial Weapons Party, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Long after a small victory in March’s special election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District, which is widely seen, he appeared as a well-known name.
The seat had been occupied by Republicans for a decade, and President Trump took the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given a small portion to the Democrats.
The U.S. has been pushing to punish El Salvador for backing China, which it later withdrew.
The diplomat said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with a bit of pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had an intimate meeting with President of Panama, John Carlos Virela, and had a hotel in Panama that later fired the Trump Foundation’s teammates.
The ministry's spokesman, Heather Newert, said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials had decided to recognize the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions based in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama as part of a "recent debate" over the issue.
But the penalty was imposed only against El Salvador, who had won $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including support for drug control, development, and the economy.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts to grants and targeted visa restrictions, have been painful for a country in Central America, with high levels of unemployment and possible homicide rates.
As the domestic meetings unfolded, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-ranking conference, focusing on economic security and well-being, in order to pursue the previous year's meeting on these issues, and as a step forward in efforts to stop the move.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted to hold a conference to end considerations of El Salvador’s sentence.
The diplomat said that Vice President Mike Pence is due to make a statement at the following conference on the little mention of the department’s imports, which will take place in mid-October.
And three U.S. political representatives slowly returned to El Salvador, Panama, the Dominican Republic, with the absence of harsh messages from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Balton declined to comment on the debate created by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss domestic talks, subject to confidentiality of names.
Their accounts were confirmed by a foreign analyst, who has close ties to the office and has continued to agree to speak in his name in the event of confidentiality.
Study of History
The next boot to be thrown could be Robert Mueller’s special report on preventing Mr Trump from doing justice, which is now well documented in public records.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller is also beginning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was in collusion with Russia that attacked our election.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will find himself answering that he is ready to go against the voters and perhaps the jury.
That brings up a lot of reasons, and I don’t mean to suggest that Trump’s fall – not even his peers in Europe – is inevitable.
Here are the choices that must be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will have an impact on the principle of how long the effort will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike against Hitler, only if the West resisted him and favored the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to prevent years of mass murder.
This history-centered trend is such a hint of inflation, and the indescribable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are faced with a lot of such inflation points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump's deputy general secretary, Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation, was removed?
Rosenstein has been burning in hot water since the newspaper reported last year that he had secretly recorded President Trump’s voice and smeared rumors that he was inappropriate for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times’ statements are wrong.
"What will we do to Britt Kavanaugh's proposed new FBI investigation if it's not fair - or if he's prosecuted as the head of the Star Wars in spite of flagrant allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, after all, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress to put Mr. Trump on the ballot?
If we fail in these experiments, democracy will have a long-lasting winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was expelled from Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which had once occupied my embassy.
He survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later sent me to light the candles on a table on which the broken cross of the Nazis had been placed.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Rangers is optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
The host of Thursday's Rapid Vienna, knowing about the Atlantic's defeat after equal scores against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the European G-League.
Damage to the knee area caused Graham to not be able to score 2-2 against Villariel earlier this season, but he believes Rangers can use these results as a dive board for better things.
The 31-year-old said, "That was a good point for us because Villaril is a good side."
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came back with a score.
Maybe we could win the game back at the end, but overall, the result was equally fair.
I think they were better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
With the start of Thursday, another big European night awaits.
We hope we can score three points on our own, but this game will be difficult because they have had good results in their past games, but with the people behind us, I’m sure we can try and get a good result.
Last year was really hard, among all the things that happened with my knee injury and the changes that appeared in the club, but now there is a good feeling factor.
Our group is good and the kids enjoy it, the education is also good.
We hope that we can move forward, put the past season behind us, and win.

While the sharers of the service had a clear view of how they wanted to be taken care of, a number of people talked to their families about it.
Nearly half of those surveyed across the country said they were talking about the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked about their children.
Holly Sander, the country's deputy insurance trader, said: "People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to start this discussion."
You can start from here.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t get your family ready when you’re ready to take care of yourself if you don’t put your desires before them.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how care should be obtained, and those choices can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you to suggest a way to pay for the above-mentioned uses.
Your long-term extension choices can include a regular long-term insurance policy, a combined cash value policy to pay for these uses, or insure yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Throw out your legal documents: move on to legal struggles.
Get health care proxies so that you can appoint a trusted person to control your medical care and make sure that professionals conform to your requests, if you can't speak.
Also, consider a credit card for your financial affairs.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that bills are paid if you can't.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents are facing a medical emergency and are heading to a mental hospital.

Category: Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said while the death toll is rising, at least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
While the talks facilities have been destroyed, aid officials have been unable to find out about the Dongala area, an area north of Palu that was closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake center.
After the Palu disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
A number of key facts about Palu and Dongla on the island of Sulawesi are as follows:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the east coast of the island of Sulawesi with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
The area of Dongla is located along the northeastern coastline of the island of Sulawesi as much as 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The area is an administrative area under the province and its population reached 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are important economic resources in the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal area of the Dongla.
The nickel mine is also important in the province of Haier, but much of it is located in Moroli, off the coast of Sulawesi.
On the basis of the reduction in Indonesian, Palu and Dongla disasters over the past 100 years, the tsunami has been attacked several times.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongla.
Another tsunami occurred in 1996 in Dongguan, which killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific ring of earthquakes and is usually attacked by earthquakes.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in Georgia in recent years are as follows:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Issaquah Province, in northern Samarta, was struck by a tsunami on December 26 that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea and killing much of the Issaquah.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the western coast of Samrat in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island, off the coast of Samara.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake in southern Java shook Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that swept the southern coast and destroyed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake near Padang shakes the capital of South Samtria province.
More than 1,100 were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake shook the islands of Mintawai closer than Samatra, triggering a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed a large number of towns and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake shook the Jaia area in Isah, causing homes to be demolished and people to panic as it made them reminiscent of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: The large earthquakes on the tourist island of Indonesia shook Limbuk, killing 500 people in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily shut down thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Turk Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of harassment.
According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin was arrested by the Alaska Department of Homeland Security on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report of domestic violence, and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman he knew asked him to call the police and report the alleged crime, he took the phone from him.
KTUU reported that Palin was held in the Met-Su building prior to the hearing and based on $500 unsecured bonds.
The network reported that he appeared in court on Sunday, where he was asked if he accepted the charges, calling himself "certainly innocent."
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, meaning he could be sentenced to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been convicted of a Class B offense, punishable by a day’s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with raping his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending at Whitrens Alaska Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of harassment of the family, interfering with reports of domestic violence, and having a drunken gun in connection with an incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
After linking his son to the PSTD that he suffered during his service in Iraq, Sarah Palin was criticized by the ex-military group in 2016.
Indonesian Tsunami: Sounds Killed
Nearly 384 people were killed in an earthquake that shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami that did not destroy thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been lost, and it is expected that the level of those killed will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake shook the center of Sulawesi, located in the northeastern capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The videos that have been broadcast on social media show the moments of this earthquake.
When the tsunami struck, hundreds of people gathered at a beach party in Palo Alto.
U.S. Attorneys Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of NYC Terror Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York for Sifulo Sipov, suspected of launching a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, are demanding the death penalty -- a rare punishment that has not been implemented since 1953 for federal crimes in the state.
The 30-year-old is accused of hiring a Larry Barry to carry out an attack on a motorcycle pavement along the West Side Highway in Manhattan, which caused him to stop walking and cycling on the sidewalks in October.
According to the announcement, in order to seek the death penalty, which has been registered in the Southern District of New York, to justify the conviction, prosecutors must prove that Sipov killed eight victims in the "international" form and injured in the "international" form.
Based on court documents, both courts may issue a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, the Federal Supreme Court declared 22 crimes against Sipov, including eight counts of homicide by mitigation, usually used by federal prosecutors in planned crimes and one count of violence and destruction of vehicles.
While prosecutors called the attack "planned and massive," they described the order in which Sipov carried it out as "figistic, violent, and corrupt."
The statement of intent states that "Sifulo Habibalovich Sipov has caused injuries, injuries to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Evangelini, Nikolas Clives, En-Laura DiCadet, Derin Drake, Ariel Irlig, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alexandro Pegnoco,"
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York sentenced someone to death.
Defendant against Khalid Bernice was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Itel Rosenberg, a married couple after they were convicted of plotting espionage for the Soviet Union two years ago, during the Cold War.
Both of them were sentenced to death by e-mail on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Sipov, whose main nationality is Uzbekistan, showed less regret in the days and months after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the statement of the crime, Sipov told officials that he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing videos of ISIS on his phone.
Police said he continued to ask for ISIS flags to be placed in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Peton, one of the Federal Public Prosecutors’ lawyers representing Sipov, said they were “disappointed by the prosecutor’s decision.”
“We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting his crime and imprisoning him for life with no chance of releasing him will only cause long-term damage to such incidents for all involved,” he said.
Sipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to punish him with death penalty.
ToriMP says Nigel Farage should be appointed as the head of the Berkistan negotiations.
Nigel Farage swore an oath to "mobilize the people's energies" during the protests at the Tory conference today.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the "warmth of Europe's pessimists" - as one member of parliament suggested Tirisa should be appointed as the head of negotiations with the Areva Union.
Speaking at a rally in Birmingham, Peter Bonn, a member of the Conservative Legislature, said that if Mr Farage were Brexit minister, the UK would be "separated from the European Union."
But Chelsea, who faces deep divisions in the reconciliation department of her deeply divided officials, has been underlined by the already-remaining lanes that have launched their protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the plan of compromise of war in the course of attacks by the Brexiteers, the survivors and the European Union.
The allies stressed that he would continue to choose one of the options "between his package and the turmoil" by trying to make a deal with Brussels, despite the reactions - and pressure from European pessimists and workers.
Boone told demonstrators to get out, which meant going out in Sullivan, that he wanted to "throw away the cockroaches."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be appointed as a peer and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
He said, “If he was the boss, we might be out now.”
Member of Parliament Willingborough added: "I stand with Brexit, but we have to throw the checkers away.
While announcing his position against the European Union, he said: "We did not participate in world wars because we are dominated.
We want to have our own law in our country.”
Mr Boone rejected suggestions that people’s views had changed since the 2016 vote, saying: “This theory that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the European Union is completely untrue.”
Bricksiter Tour, Andrea Jinkin, also participated in the protests and told reporters: "I'm simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The chakras have no reputation among the people, the opponents will not vote, it is not common in the party and among our activists to go to the streets and choose us at the first opportunity.
“Please, please, stop and listen to us.”
In a message, she added: "First ministers, when they carry out their commitments, retain their posts."
Farage told the protesters that politicians should be forced to "feel warm" if they are to overstep the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this has a relationship to trust between us - our people and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’ve come together here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do this.’
In a message to the gathering, he said: “I want you to force the class of politicians who are on the brink of Brexit betrayal to feel the heat.
"We will mobilize the people of this country who won us at Brexit, and we will never rest until we become independent, self-governing, and proud of Britain."
However, before their two-hour protests in City Center, the Reminers continued their demonstrations along the way.
A group of activists reacted to Turiz after the group’s opening during the weekend by raising banners.
The Labour counterpart of Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they faced at the start of the conference because of the party’s tools.
"These are the ones who are telling us that they can have IT systems including all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders without borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland."
"This is a complete imitation.
There's nothing better than a good Brexit," he added.
Warren will think about being a candidate in the presidential election.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think" about running for president.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future during a meeting at the Western Massachusetts Salon on Saturday.
Warin, one of President Donald Trump’s frequent critics in November’s re-election, shared the story with GOP state representative Jeff Dial, who is Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman.
He is focusing on speculations that he may be in Trump’s paper in 2020.
The occasion on Saturday afternoon, since the beginning of Trump's work, was his 36th meeting with lawmakers, using the Thon Hall format.
One of the participants asked if he had plans to run for president.
Verne responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and rebuild the broken government, and for that to happen, there needs to be a woman at the leadership level."
In the case of shooting and killing the LSU Sims, one arrest has taken place.
Police in Concrete Rogue, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder case of a LSU basketball player had been arrested on Friday.
The Concrete Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson at an ET news conference at 8:00 a.m.
They released a shooting video on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the video.
The 20-year-old was shot and killed early Friday near the campus of the Southern University.
Police Chief J. Powell told 247Sports on Saturday that "Whidey Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the area of his head and died as a result."
Wade came forward to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene and had the gun, and admitted that he had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was apprehended without incident and brought to the East Parish Concrete Police Department.
A 6-foot-6-tall teenager who was spotted in the concrete rogue leaf, Sims appeared in 32 games last season with 10 starts, and won an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 returns in each match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the World Cup, after closing the team's line-up to win against Sebastian Vettel.
It was clear from the moment that on Saturday, Valentini Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton and that Mercedis will play a big part of the race.
From the start of the bar, Bottas made a good start, almost putting Hamilton in danger while he defended his position in two rounds and allowed Vitil to attack the top of his team member.
Vitil Nest went to the balls and left Hamilton to run on his backpack in the middle of the river, which certainly should have happened.
Mercediz later lowered the range and emerged from behind Whittle, but Hamilton, after a few wheel-to-wheel operations that saw the Firari driver in the interior with high risk, stepped back after a double move to defend the third corner with negligence.
Max Verstappen started from the back train of the building, and at the end of the first domain during his 21st birthday, took on the seventh domain.
He then went on to a big part of the race, so he focused on his tyres to make an agile finish and move on to fourth place, ahead of Kimmy Ricconin.
He also went into the 44th-range pits, but could not speed up in the remaining eight ranges because the riconine was in the fourth range.
It’s a tough day because Voltaire did a great job all weekend and he was a respectable man who allowed me.
The team has done an exceptional job that has led us to make a double seed of it," Hamilton said.
Annie was a very bad person.
President Trump ridiculed Sen. Dini Phinnistine at a rally on Saturday over his insistence on not disclosing the letter of Christine Blasi Ford, who has accused the prosecution's candidate, Britt Kavanaugh, of sexual harassment.
While speaking to protesters in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what happened in the Senate showed people to be "post, dirty, and untrue."
"What's possible and beautiful is happening in the Senate over the last few days, when you see anger, when you see people being angry, they're dirty and they're wrong," he said.
"When you look at the magazines and the revelations, then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Deannie Finstein, have you disclosed?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
Well, wait a minute.
Did we disclose ... No, we did not disclose,” he added in the senator’s imagination.
A letter in July, detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, had been sent by Ford to Finnstein and was revealed in September - but Finnstein refused to disclose the letter from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I didn’t reveal his story,” Hill told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as he had requested."
But his denial didn't seem acceptable to the president, and that led him to talk about it during Saturday night's march. "Let me tell you something, that was a very bad bodily lexicon.
He may not have done it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In order to defend the nominee, Sehra Shahram, who has been accused of sexually abusing three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the allegations to their advantage.
“They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see the mail, the crap of them, they don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to put on them to gain power and control," Meditya said in a statement.
Elite League: Dondy Starrs 3-5 Bilfast Jaitleys
Peter Dewer scored two wickets against Dondy.
Donny Stars, who played in the Elite League on Friday, lost to Bilfast Giants, a group that won 3-5 in the return race on Saturday.
Giants scored two goals in the early stages of the race, through strikeouts by Patrick Deir and Frances Beylord.
Mike Sullivan and Jarden Assy brought the ball to his side before he defeated Dewey Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the same points for Dondi before Lucas Lundoval secured them a win for Nilsen.
This was the third Elite League defeat this season for the Men's Quality Men, who came back Friday night to defeat the runners-up in a 1-2 draw at the Bilfist.
This was the fourth race of the season between the two sides, as a result of which Jaitley won three races.
Dewey's starter came to the field in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFall, when Beviller struck a second wicket four minutes later, David Rutherford helped him.
At the start of the payoff, Sullivan re-entered his side at 13:10, before Matt Markwardet made an ass tie at 15:16.
When he made his second deception at the end of Dorothy, Dorothy ensured that Giddens would take the lead during the first pause.
The side of the group was re-created and Baud at 27:37, once again put them through a strong play trick in a conditional level state.
Connie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help out with Milesine and get Dondy the first deception in the late second round, and he ensured that he would also make the fifth half of that team in the final round.
The team, which has been defeated in their last four games, will face Milton Keynes on Friday.
The air traffic controller dies, but ensures hundreds of air passengers can escape the quake.
An air traffic controller is appreciated as a hero after he ensured that the flight, which involved hundreds of passengers, could fly safely from the field.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have disappeared as a result of the earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
So strong earthquakes continue to shake the area and many people have been trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades fleeing the area to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Ganavan Agong refused to flee his duty at the Oscillation Control Tower at El Joffrey Palo airfield.
He stayed there to ensure that Batik Flight 6321, which was in the airport band, flew safely.
After thinking about the traffic control tower code, he jumped down from it.
He later died in the hospital.
ABC News Australia reported that Indonesian air route spokesman Johannis Seraith said his decision had saved hundreds of lives.
We set up a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
But unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter reached Palo.
"When we heard about it, our hearts broke," he added.
While officials fear that the death toll could reach thousands, the country's disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongla, Sighi and Butong is limited.
The spokesman, Sutopo Porovo Nogruho, said: "The death toll still seems to be on the rise because so many bodies are still in ruins while the majority of them cannot be dealt with."
The waves, which reached a height of 6 meters, turned Palo, who buried the bodies in a mass grave on Sunday, into rubble.
Military and military aircraft are transporting aids and materials.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are transporting bodies at any moment.
There is little clean water.
Small markets have been stolen everywhere."
Jen Gilfand, president of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is looking to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll get there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I want you all to work night and day to complete every task related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia was also hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Now Niugini airline says a man has disappeared after Legon plane crash
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed in Legoland Pacific in Micronesia, says a man has disappeared following previous statements about the safe evacuation of 47 passengers and flight members from the plane.
Newgini Airlines said in a statement that it was not possible to find a passenger until the afternoon of Saturday.
The airline said it was in contact with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the denial.
The company did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and flight members after the plane collided with water trying to sit on the island's Chuck airfield.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all were in good condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane crashed in Legon due to the airport's lacking bandwidth.
A number of witnesses thought he had crossed the airport bridge.
American passenger Bill Giants said the plane went too low.
Janice said, "That's a good thing."
Janez said she and others were able to get into the water that was reaching the waistline to reach the exit gate of the sinking plane.
He said the flight crews were terrified and screaming, and he took a small head wound from the area.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers were working in the vicinity to improve the docks and also helped rescue passengers using wind boats and transport them to shore before the plane sank in 30 meters (100 ft) of water.
Information from the routing security network suggests that 111 people have been killed as a result of the crash of aircraft of PNG-registered companies in the last two decades, but none of these crashes included the airline.
Analysts provide a timetable for a night that was burned alive.
Prosecutors closed the case on Saturday with a hearing again by a man accused of burning down a living Mississippi woman in 2014.
The president was certified as a witness in the intelligence analysis department for many hours.
He had a timetable for the jury on how he used telephone records to track the moves of 29-year-old defender Quinton Tilis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers during the night he died.
Clarion Leader reported that Rollit, contradicting her earlier statements, said she had obtained local information from a large number of mobile phones that showed Tilly was with Chambers at dinner on the day of her death.
When information showed that his phone was running when Chambers said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Teal'c was telling the truth about what he said that night in Larry Sanford, Sanford said he "lies because my Larry was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Teal'c said he had known Chambers for two weeks before his death.
The phone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
Rollitt said that shortly after Chambers’ death, Teal’c removed Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
Hall said, "He removed Chambers from his life."
The defense of the matter set its closing debates for Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be transferred to the committee later that day.
What's the point of Hip-Hop?
A hip hop artist wants to challenge negative theories about the genre by enriching his music with a positive message.
Brady from Bristol claims that hip-hop has gone astray from its originality of transmitting political messages and fighting social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop conscious again.
Artists such as Foggies and Comenius have witnessed this art again in the UK through artists such as Ekala and Loki.
A black man to each other?
New York Nurse Complains Against A Couple For Dismissing Her After A "Discriminatory" Message
A New York nurse complains about a couple who dismissed her discriminatoryly after receiving a misleading message from her mother about her complaint that she was "another black man too."
These pairs reject this statement as if it were a work of art and seem to make it similar to "force."
Lensy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed dismay when her new babysitter, Giselle Marrick, arrived on her first working day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flexman said to her husband in a message, "No, another black."
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Murrick twice.
According to the New York Skin, after realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman "disappointed" Murika, saying that her former child nurse, who was an African-American, had done a bad job, and that she had done something wrong in return.
Mrs. Morris was paid a salary for a day's work and sent home by Texy Ober.
Now Morris is complaining of the couple for the damages of waiving his duties and the damages of $350 a day for six months, something he was set for, of course, without a contract.
He told the skin on Friday, "I want to show them, see, don't do this," and added, "I know that's discrimination."
The pair responded to the allegations, saying they were not discriminatory, adding that terminating Morris's job was a reasonable job because they were afraid they couldn't trust him after an ugly procedure.
"My wife had sent him something in the message that he was not meant to say.
He's not discriminating.
We're not people with discrimination at work," Mrs. Joel Plasco's husband told Skin.
“But will you hand over your children to someone you have treated badly, even if the procedure is wrong?”
Your child's child?
“Come again.”
While similarizing the situation to “force,” Plasco said his wife had given birth two months ago and she was “in a difficult situation.”
"Will you go after someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the matter is ongoing, the public theory firm moved quickly to announce the pair on social media and condemned them for their procedure and logic.
The new letter suggests that the publishers of Peddington expressed concern that the readers would not be able to communicate with the bear speaker.
The letter says that Band's daughter, Crane Jenkel, was born shortly after the book was accepted. "It's difficult to walk into the boots of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's really interesting to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He said his father, who worked with the BBC as a filmmaker before being inspired to write children's books by a little bear, might have thought that his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "Shirini Tandi" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who calls him "a very important member of his family," he said his father was slowly proud of his ultimate success.
He said, "He was a very calm man and not an energetic person."
"But because Paddington was so real to him, the situation had become almost like having a kid who was accomplishing something: you were proud of him, even though you didn't play a part in it.
I think he had been a musketeer for Paddington's success in this way.
"Although it was his creativity and imagination, he always gave Paddington all the credit."
My daughter dies, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
Sitting on the ground, his daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
Ms. Edenan Lapierre said, "Nad Pippi was called in a row to say it, and she said she wasn't expected to act to do it."
"After Ned got a phone call saying he'd be dead in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I will come to you soon.
I will be with you.
The spice that the doctors had given him had slowed the pumping of his heart to finally stop his system.
He had died a long time ago, and his system had stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that everything would be revealed.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and friends.
I had to keep my feelings to myself.”
Eventually, Ms. Edenan-Lapierre, who was drowning in the loss of her daughter, sat down with the other passengers on the ground - it's clear what she was going through.
He said, "Nobody knew,"
"I lowered my head, and in all this flow, tears flowed from my eyes.
It's very difficult to express it, but I was on the flight when I felt intense pity for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Punished Woman Posts Cards to Prevent Suicides at Bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide work together to prevent each other from taking their lives.
Sherron Davis and Kelly Hamfrey use inspiring messages and phone numbers on the Bridge of Willis to call people for support.
Mrs. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he was depressed and died at the age of 18.
She said, "I don't want other parents to have the feeling I feel every day."
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a dedicated cook with a beautiful smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that her smile illuminated every room."
However, before he died, he left his job because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the first to see his brother take his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I was concerned as a dovetail that a secondary effect was occurring."
Ms. Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they're a friend of yours.
"Don't shut up, you need to talk."
Ms. Hamfries, who has been Ms. Davis’s friend for many years, lost her partner 15 years after her mother’s death.
"He didn't say he was feeling suffocated or worried or anything," he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
"He was very quiet on Christmas Day - when the kids were opening the gift boxes, he didn't even look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death had a big impact on his family but they had to deal with the situation: “This has created a hole in our family.
He has separated us from each other.
But we have to bear this fact and fight it.”

The future of Breit Kavanaugh has been postponed as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we got something in the first place, like something that he called for research limited in time, limited in scope, we could create maybe a little bit of unity," Fleck said Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "should be distracted by the ongoing crackdown on the partisan mesh."
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
All of them are just for the sake of time.
The midterm elections will take place within five weeks, and on November 6 - if Republicans are expected to perform badly - they will be strongly applauded in their efforts to elect a man to the country's largest court.
George W. Bush picks up the phone and calls the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bass in the White House and through him, he met with his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Ashley's personal secretary.
What will happen after the report is made by the FBI?
A vote will begin in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is unclear whether Mr. Quanwa could win at least 50 percent of the vote in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to draw the same votes and approve him for the presidential nomination.
The number of North Korean refugees under Kim's rule has declined.
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has fallen since Kim came to power seven years ago.
Park Bayong-siug, citing information from the Southern Union Department, said last year the number of fugitives rose to 1,127, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter controls on the border between North Korea and China and high rates of smuggling had been key factors in moving people.
Pyongyang did not make any general remarks.
South Korea grants the vast majority of refugees the citizenship of North Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
A large number of these people are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and crossing the highly-preserved call zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas is easy.
China recognizes refugees instead of refugees, as illegal immigrants, and usually forces them to return to the country.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss Pyongyang’s pain, which had focused on nuclear disarmament talks.
The statement came after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on each other's terms to move forward towards a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Secretary of State Ray Yong-hoe later accused the U.S. of failing to make progress.
Speaking at the United Nations Council in New York, Ray said: “Without any high confidence in the United States, there will be no self-confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Nancy Pilosi calls Britt Kuvana "a sick Easter patient" and says she's not fit to carry a tight star
Minority House leader Nancy Pelosi called the star candidate Breit Kavanaugh "suffering from starry disease" and said she wasn't much of a fit to serve in the star.
Pilosi made these statements during an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Celebration in Austin, Texas.
On Thursday, Pilosi, in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "I can't believe that if a woman did that, they would have counted her as an Easter patient."
Kavanaugh denied allegations of sexual harassment by Dr. Christine Blasi Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of the statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and once when he talked about his family and the years of Lissy, he even screamed and coughed.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "inappropriate and coordinated character murder" that was planned by the freedom fighters for their anger at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pilosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court because his testimony showed he was adept at Democrats.
He said, "I think that by expressing such statements and the way he spoke to the Clintons and Democrats, he is disqualifying himself."
Pilosi responded to the question of whether he would call Kavanaugh if Kavanaugh approved, and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm telling you this -- if he doesn't tell Congress and the BFI the truth, then he's not only inappropriate for the rank of star of the court, but he won't have the merit of being in the court that he now serves," Pilosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Circuit Court of D.C. Appeals.
Pilousi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings against or against the Affordable Care Act. Wade because he counts as a conservative judge.
At his affirmative hearings, Kavanaugh turned aside in response to questions about whether he would reverse the court’s specific decision.
Pilosi said, "Nowadays, people with streaks are not passionate about going to court and expecting us to say, 'Isn't that great?'"
And it is necessary for women to work on it.
That's not a criticism, months and years of anger, and she still can't get it out without crying.
Ms. Stannim said to me after 45 years, "When we get angry, we cry,"
"I don't think that's unusual, do you think?"
She continued, "A woman with me helped me a lot where there was an executive, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she revealed to a technician that when she was angry, and she started crying, she was laughing at the person I was talking to, 'You might think I was laughing at.'"
I'm angry."
And then he went on like this.
And I thought it was a great job.”
Tears are like pouring out heroes because they are so much understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of one of my early duties in an office that was dominated by men, where once I found myself confronted with indescribable rage, Zach, an older woman than me, grabbed me from the scarf of my neck - an angry manager who I always feared to some extent.
He said to me, "Never let them see your tears."
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re silent and they’ll be happy because that’s their goal.”
Petrischia Scavider, who later stood at the Congress as a representative of Colorado, had been working on Hart's presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was thrown out of the fight on an outside ship called Manki Business, Mrs. Scrawider was deeply disappointed, finding that there was no reason for her not to run for president.
He said to me 30 years later with a smile, "This wasn't the right decision to think."
"At the time, there were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was to add another candidate.
Someone called it “The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
When he joined the campaign, he lagged behind in the money laundering department and swore by them that he would not get into the business if he didn't earn $2 million in the laundering.
It was a losing war.
He found that a number of his supporters who gave him $1,000 to men would give him only $250.
He asked, "Do they think I'm getting a discount?"
When he declared and announced that he would not open a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed by emotions - a gratitude from those who would support him, a disappointment from the system that had led him to obtain the impeachment in order to target voters in exchange for a sworn vote.
Ms. Scorder recalled how the media reacted to her, "You might have thought I was dealing with a nervous breakdown,"
"You may have thought that Clinix was my company's developer.
I remember what I thought they would put on my gravestone.
"Did he cry?"
The U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing.
Experts say the initial excuses for starting a trade war between the United States and China were noisy, and while the war is far from over, a scratch between these countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year with a tax on key Chinese exports, including solar, iron and aluminum panels.
The most significant escalation came with new tariffs this week, affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of products, which affects all products coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded with kind words each time, and lately with tariffs of five to ten per century on $60 trillion of American products.
China has pledged to react to any U.S. actions, and it is unlikely that this will have a negative impact on the world’s second-largest economy so soon.
Returning to Washington would mean quarreling in demands, but kneeling in front of the world would be a shameful act for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing does the right thing, the U.S.-led trade war with China can be backed positively in the long run by mutual reliance on both economies.
Abigail Grace, the research assistant who focuses on the new American security for Asia in Central Asia, said, "The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing could create a situation that would deteriorate in one of these countries, and this would be more dangerous than previous predictions."
Foreign Minister Says Syria 'Ready' to Return Migrants
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of migrants and calls for help to rebuild a country that has been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
While speaking at the United Nations General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mahram said the situation in the country was improving.
He said, "Today his more stable situation is safer, thanks to the unveiling in the fight against pro-democracy,"
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by the terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are prepared for the voluntary return of the insurgents to the country who were forced to flee due to terrorism and the amounts of one-sided economic activity that had affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have migrated from the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more have been living in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mahram said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that have prolonged the uprising.

“I usually don’t cry, but I couldn’t stop my tears today.
This year was very difficult.
Thank you very much to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I am very happy, I am very happy to have won the Cup again.
"It's about the team, and I'm very happy to be able to help," he said after the European Championship.
He gave the torch to his comrade, John Ram, who defeated the U.S. golf genius Tiger Woods by a 2&1 score in Sunday's singles game.
The 23-year-old said, "I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods because I grew up watching this man's races."

This morning, when we arrived, we also set fire to Europe.
We threw it away.
Well done, Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 players were very good.
We’ll rebuild the group, I’ll work with the PGA America and our Reader’s Cup committee again and we’ll move forward.
I love these 12 men and am proud to have served as their captain.
You have to wear your hat.
We went ahead in the race.”
