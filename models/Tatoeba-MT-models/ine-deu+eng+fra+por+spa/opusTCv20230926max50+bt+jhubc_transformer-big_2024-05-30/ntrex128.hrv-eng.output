Welsh parliamentarians fear they will "look like Muppets"
Some Assembly Members (AM) were shocked by the proposal that they could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the council to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Parliament from all political spectrums are concerned that they may become the subject of debate.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the name was "rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp govance.
A parliamentary representative from the Wales Party (Plaid Cymru) said the group as a whole was "unhappy" and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to a change of name, but that the MWP in the speech could quickly turn into a Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh word "w" is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire English word for "u".
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently preparing a law to introduce a change of name, announced the following: “Of course, the final decision on how parliamentary deputies will be entitled will be on their own.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposals that have received broad support for changing the name of the council to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what would be called members of the House, the Committee was inclined to call them “Members of the Welsh Parliament” or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
House MPs are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring headaches to House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to come forward with a bill on changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the council operates, including rules on the disqualification of council members and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, parliamentarians will have a decisive voice on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians are going to a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The aim of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted on the claim that its northern neighbor's name represents the emergence of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognize the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Silenced as Harlem Churches Struggle for Survival
“The older people I spoke to said that in the past there could be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no one else today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are socializing differently nowadays,” he said.
“Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly live.”
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as church leaders think and “sooner or later they will find themselves again at the beginning.”
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people would live who would not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings will be white,” he said, “so the day will come sooner when those churches will be completely closed because residents who move into those apartments are unlikely to become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation, which held worship services nearby, took ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson who also led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting black people.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July used another name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing a larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is taking place in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors of construction works, some of which were brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the parish's governing body made up of laity, wrote to the diocese in July because of concerns that the diocese would "try to transfer costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of construction works sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old While Diving for Lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving behind a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then with the group drove him to the scene of the attack to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was excitement about the lobster caught, but then he realized he was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire clavicular bone had been torn apart.
"I tried to get everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablado to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and safety of the swimmers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury’s is becoming a competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic counters in the style of department stores and hiring specialized vendors.
As part of the UK beauty market entry of 2.8 billion GBP, which continues to grow as sales in the clothing and home equipment market decline, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year.
Investing in cosmetics is one of the ways that supermarkets try to take advantage of the shelf space that was once intended for televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its cosmetics offerings to 3,000 products, including first-time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees range will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique decorative cosmetics range, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and that’s what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be trialling concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first which opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second which opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and returning to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets would increasingly look like grocery stores as the supermarket chain struggles to withstand low-cost stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments, because it bought both chains two years ago, thereby encouraging the sale of groceries and making these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to refresh their cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury’s joined Boots in early 2000, but this ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical business to Lloyds Pharmacy’s 281 store Celesia for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skin care products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training of colleagues who will be at the hand of customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for purchasing cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby quit <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
The star of the show Dragon’s Den Peter Jones left to “cook out of anger” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby resigned from a <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with retail chain Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand of homewear and fashion accessories Truly.
Their brand is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The show's host This Morning (37) announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragon’s Den Peter Jones cooking out of anger by retiring at the last minute from a lucrative joint venture to focus on her own great new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "enraged" when a golden girl on television during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million mean there's no longer enough time to devote to their brand's true home.
The deal was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and was intended to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to step down shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to starting the whole line.
In the headquarters of the company Marlow warehouse is a lot of goods that is ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of the host of the show This Morning, one of the stars in Britain in which it is most profitable to invest, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes, and if possible postponement of additional.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as Chairman of the Board in March.
The couple spend their holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I’m a celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to comment on his business activities.”
Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would get in the newspapers for comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and for having such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make so many concessions?”
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news leader.
“I didn’t make any concessions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
Negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that the North had not noticed a "appropriate reaction" from the United States to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the U.S. still has not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech at the rally.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We have been threatened by a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results — an interruption of test launches, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting in front of this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear about not seeking international assistance, so it’s all a bit problematic,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is building a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Office, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in aid efforts.
Given the constant shaking of the ground in Indonesia, that country is still sadly unprepared to cope with the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, this is not something that is common in other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best of times, traveling between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was anchored in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is on its way to Pal, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's collapsed structure was the foundation of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Joko is struggling with a lack of funding, and new elections are being held next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a goal for a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea by striking in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal at a score of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He moved the ball to his left leg before kicking it against the opposite tripod.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepaja Arrizabalaga, who jumped towards it and entered the net.
"It was challenging to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think about it too much and I just shot."
Chelsea led in the half-time 1-0 after hitting Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The striker of the blues passed the ball back to Mate Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> during that match before turning somewhere on the half of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he pointed the beautiful passing ball that Hazard had brought to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball in the grid with his left leg on the opposite stand next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play a club match against Naples in the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will welcome Videoton to the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll in Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state's disaster office said on Sunday morning.
The agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference that a large number of people were reported trapped in the ruins of buildings after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that was felt on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of ruins of demolished buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after his wife was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews in John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called people in the area to call if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still in its infancy, but I would like everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also invite anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken pictures of something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who believe they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway, and police said the process of informing the victim's closest relatives is underway.
A taxi driver living on Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one should enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants are now told that it will take several hours before they can return to their apartments.
The officer allegedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
He keeps saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans in the fenced area, and another was parked just outside.
A large number of policemen stood inside the fenced area and monitored the apartment block.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, citing Minutes 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament is the latest monument found in the middle of a debate about "crossing history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupid" and "an attempt to cross history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of Westminster Palace would become the subject of discussion.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something that Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent revival of Cromwell’s Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th-century way of thinking and part of the historiography of a person that many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament from external pressure.
Whether this is a fully credible opinion is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector are still worthy of honor and commemoration."
Pig killer kills Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man with only the surname "Yuan" was found dead in an artery cut and covered in blood near a stall at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China Morning Newspaper reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms bit the breeder to death.
Guiyang's evening news reports that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated."
The footage from the security camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else as police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market management are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, pig attacks on humans have already been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig tied a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States.
As announced, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain over the next few days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa was blowing at a speed of 140 km/h at 05:00 Eastern time, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is forming above the Pacific and moving toward the U.S. West Coast. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to suppress a deep layer of tropical moisture northwards toward the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture, in interaction with the approaching low-pressure area, will cause heavy rainfall in much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, mudslides and possible slippages in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause rainfall that will amount to about 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with the rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not advisable to go to the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into savage rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local stormy winds and a dustbin.
Approaching the low-pressure area will bring local heavy rains on parts of the southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause less muddy floods and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainy season in the region.
Scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning before ending the day on Monday and covering a wider area on Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the borders of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah on Tuesday and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes are possible across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will continue to grow and spread again.
In most of the central and eastern U.S., the beginning of October is expected to be warm with 27 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the tense testimony of Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political settlement continued, and reporters interrupted the regular program to announce a turnaround at the last minute on Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was completely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her drunk and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a zealous testimony that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, according to a Nielsen report.
The company had an average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks broadcasting the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people watching content in offices.
To give you a better idea, this is an audience that is similar in number to the one that watches the playoffs of American football or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the studio strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained large even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning filmed protesters yelling at him as he tried to go to the Justice Committee's hearing by elevator.
For a few minutes, he stood with his eyes peeled as protesters overcame him in front of CNN's cameras.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement even before the elevator door closed that he would say more at a committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks watched live when the Justice Committee was due to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigates the charges against the candidates over the next week, as demanded by Democrats who are in the minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in a second interview with her in the same issue on the cover, continued to criticize her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal that the UK and the EU should charge each other customs duties is “totally stupid.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained on suspicious murder charges, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released a video of the conflict between the Sims and the Simpsons, and police said the Sims lost their glasses in the conflict.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS, reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
A $350,000 bail was requested.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department thanked the Louisiana Federal State Police Refugee Task Force, the Federal State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for enforcing the law on “perseverance and the search for the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what we always worry about,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes at Mexico City
The ash that ejects the Popocatapetl volcano has reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple buzzing and shaking.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed the volcano's increased activity 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clash between Catalan separatists and police to mark the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with intervention police and thousands of people joined counter-demonstration to mark the Catalan polarizing vote on segregation.
A group of masked separatists who were prevented by the intervention police began shooting police officers with eggs and paint in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fighting erupted later in the day when police used sticks to calm the fighting.
For a few hours, the independence groups chanted "No Forgiveness, No Forgiveness," and the unionists shouted "Long live Spain!"
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local media reported.
Tensions in a region striving for independence did not subside even a year after the referendum declared illegal by Madrid on 1 October and celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence although the turnout was small because those who opposed segregation mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Groups advocating for independence took to the streets on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The protests continued, but the protesters were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
“I watched my parents cry for the happiness they could vote for, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a key, albeit close, victory in last December's regional elections, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep up the momentum this year because their best-known leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was sparked by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidacy for the European elections is the best way we can announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after being stabbed in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after being stabbed several times in a Londonderry house.
The incident took place on Thursday at around 19:30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was fired an arrow from the arrowhead.
Menge's goal brought Livingston a victory over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston
The new Scottish Premier League club Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his only second defeat of eighteen games at the Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge's score proved decisive as Gary Holt's team settled with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without a guest win in the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the league's leading club behind eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his series of wins to six games, and head coach Holt has still not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses out on dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead even before they scored that goal, given that their direct attack caused a whole host of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but was too slow on the way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after he slipped to intercept Craig Halkett's head blow to the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause difficulties to the guests
And that’s how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston devised the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together assisting Menga who scored in the middle of the goal.
Until that point, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but faced impenetrable domestic defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the punch.
Ranger Allan McGregor's legs prevented Scott Pittman, and Lithgow drew a wide blow from another organized attack on Livingston.
Long additions failed to cross Livingston's goal line, and two elevens were not judged - after Halkett's clash with substitute Glen Middleton and one for hand play.
"Great" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent, which continued to exceed expectations on that entry route.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at leading a well-organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to take a break throughout the game.
But the Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
They were far from the standards set by a good game under Gerrard.
They failed to finish the ball to the end. They only opened a hole in the home team once and that's kind of a call to pull for the Rangers who are in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) it was all a lot of smiles under the bright sky when the leader of the Turks and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They differed in opinions on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people outside the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of supporters of the president showed up nearby to see him.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including a large number of Kurds, have raised their voices condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Conflicted demonstrations reflect the division caused by the visitor, which some German Turks hail as a hero, while others attack as an autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a dense traffic road in Deptford in the southeast of the city at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred several months after another cyclist was killed after a collision and a driver fled from the scene of the accident in Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from the scene on Saturday.
The city police said police are trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Due to the accident, roads have been closed and bus traffic has been diverted, and motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in riots in a male prison of a prisoner.
The riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special Tornado units have been brought in to counter riots involving eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Police officers on the spot were provided with assistance due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been hired to deal with the ongoing incident at the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received assistance due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they could spend longer time behind bars."
The Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the intervention police were summoned to prison to deal with a serious situation in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (possible benefit for drought areas)
Tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but it’s likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert southwest and brings the danger of storm surges.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the area from western Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach Phoenix late Monday in the rain and cross straight over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service of Phoenix tweeted: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression within a radius of 320 kilometers of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) has crossed 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the Mughal border of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest including Stjenjak and the Great Basin there is a probability of rainfall from 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total amounts up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of flooding, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a major hazard, some of these precipitations could be useful as drought is currently prevailing in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. Drought Map, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” weather.com said in a statement.
The hurricane first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km/h and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm stumbled into the colder Pacific waters and weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening by the force of a tropical storm.
The rains in parts of Mexico could be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
“The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, with a maximum of 250 mm possible,” weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then pass across Arizona and into southern Utah by Tuesday late at night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rainfall on the Baja California Peninsula, in northwestern Sonora and in the U.S. desert southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will cause life-threatening floods and mudslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
Around 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton an injured teenager was found.
He was taken to the hospital and was in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police have called for all those who have footage of the incident.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered from the anger and anger of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for rejecting the Democratic Party’s cruel and shameful tactics,” Trump said at an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "tolerated the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and resolutely and emotionally dismissed Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault dozens of years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing on the accusation she made.
The president said on Saturday that on that day “the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republicans going to midterm elections.
“Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
"I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “create resistance and obstruction.”
A Republican aide told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami continue to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed on Saturday, many of them dragged by huge waves that hit the coast when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when twilight waves of up to six meters hit the coast, drawing many of them to death and destroying everyone in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run and were killed," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he was dragging cars, trunks, houses, he hit everyone on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived,” he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to two-hundred times the power of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been demolished.
He also said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the debris of the buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications are completely interrupted and we have no information from Donggal."
"More than 300,000 people live in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers had headed to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not providing information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials say the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building can be heard panicking to warn people down the street about an upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed on the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused communications around Palu to be disrupted, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the army has started sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other necessary supplies.
The airport is only open for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
“Although World Vision staff from Donggala have successfully arrived in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in tarpaulin tents set up in the yard of their offices, they have passed on scenes of destruction along the way,” Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched wheels of assistance in the disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said in a statement.
“After the government says, ‘Okay, it’s a national disaster,’ we can receive international aid, but such a state has not yet been declared.”
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu on Friday, friends and families of those who still consider themselves missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewers.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian state paragliders team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were his students.
“Given the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled how after the news of the demolition of the Roa Roa Hotel, which expanded into a paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to contestants from Palu who participated in a beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray check mark, instead of two blue check marks.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves took away $26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee
The robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who filled an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, the Newport Police Department said in a statement.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said the driver of the car emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, the other man “came behind Brink’s employee in the race” and stole a bag of money to put in the ATM.
Witnesses noticed more suspicious people fleeing the scene of the theft, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday, he said: "Life will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The show's authors said it replaced singer Ariana Grande, who canceled for "emotional reasons."
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current artistic name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it is us.
It came from Kanya, which means ‘the one’, into Ye alone – it is a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former associate, JAY-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a bullet and with a bullet and written in capital letters.
Mexican AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would "never use an army against the Mexican people."
Military units fired during peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as left-wing student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it invests in research in that field,” said Kai Fu Lee, an AI investor and expert in the field who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence in principle.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“Double-raising the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
“Double-increasing investment could double the odds that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will come in the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee’s book, “AI Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, chief executive of SinoVation Ventures, which invests in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the best American game player Othello, and later served as director of Microsoft’s research department and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government tech competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would take place to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on artificial intelligence research in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that doctoral students in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards,” he said.
China’s National Council of Ministers announced a Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to individuals in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations providing funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve business partners and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonia's citizens voted on Saturday in a referendum on whether they want to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has been going on for several decades and which has led Greece to block the opening of negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia, and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the secession of its territory and has vetoed the country's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the exit will meet the minimum 50 percent needed to keep the referendum in place.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying in order to allow Macedonia, one of the countries created after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will respect it to consider it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, it’s our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko joined a referendum on changing the country's name on September 30, 2018, paving the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and received chairs in front of the tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not as servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to receive us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a “positive” result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will join the referendum, which is below the required response.
A second survey, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire defense of Brighton to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday broke Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, and won 2–0 for Manchester City.
Aguero made the victory insanely simple, scoring a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was added in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He broke through Brighton's three players' defenses and then reached the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opposing players in green shirts.
He bypassed one defender and then overtook them a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguero, who with the right kicked the ball into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some difficulty with his foot,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We planned to play that 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are very happy that he scored that goal at the time.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues an initial lead in the Premier League.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero won the ball deep in Brighton's field during the game.
He added the ball to Leroy Sane on his left side.
Sane pushed the ball several times before leading Sterling to the tripod.
The Sky Blues striker put the ball into the grid just before he slipped into the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to block Rockies' promotion
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to insist on a new start.
But the always-competitive Scherzer hopes for a Sunday victory against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, reach the finish line.
The Rockies secured a place in the wild-card playoffs on Friday night with a 5:2 win over the Nationals, but they still hoped to win their first title.
“Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw by knowing what the atmosphere is like here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce the Sunday starter, but they are reportedly inclined to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitching area on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-hander from Washington this season scored 18:7, an average of 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds shifts.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of Republican voters in the general election, the President made a convincing comment on his election of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
“Everything we’ve done will be tested in November.
It's five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones – I didn’t run, but I’m actually in the race and that’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
“You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that’s happening right now.
Their intention is to retake power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to overtake to take power and control; that's why they want power and control. We won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission “to dare and interfere.”
"You've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, evil, corrupt and liars."
He approached Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which caused a loud uproar among the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I’m waiting for the document – it was really bad body language, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
Does not tolerate personal attitudes
I wasn't too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome – all because of what we have in mind.
According to my colleague, Joan Ryan behaved in a similar way because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the motion of censorship for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with previous leadership.
In an announcement on Friday, the East Nottingham Labour Party branch meeting said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years that I have been working as a local Labour Party representative, the meetings of the General Council on Friday evenings have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today many meetings take place in a different tone, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as the associates I thought we shared similar political views began to demand from me a drastic change of opinion and taking positions with which I would otherwise never agree – whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a flood of insulting words on social media invoking my recall, renouncing the center’s policies and telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I know I've been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I've received are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me the most is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with each motion of no confidence or change of electoral rules we become an increasingly narrow party.
"Many times in the last two years they have advised me to bow my head, not to be so loud, and told me that then everything would be fine."
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, driven by disregard for the Margaret Thatcher government that left my school’s multi-purpose classroom decay, I have wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – either as a local councillor or a minister in government.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East branch could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will have a negative impact on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of recall or political benefit will deter me from acting as I believe it is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38:17 unbeaten Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting match of the day in Tennent's Premiership league.
They have now reached the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated out of ten teams.
Ultimately, the top defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in every game so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Every honor to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute by Frazier Climo led Ayr to the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was eliminated from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to raise the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by 11 before scoring a goal at halftime and making an independent attempt to change the score for Ayr to 17:5 on the eve of the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long pause due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott who was carried on the stretcher, and when the game continued, Ayr continued the good game with an attempt by Stafford McDowall who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again forced the additional player to pay, an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side-player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for defeating Clima who did not have a ball; from the penalty kick line, MacPherson made a lay behind Ayr in the full swing of the breakthrough.
Climo realized, as he had done almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high kick from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the home team.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in the service business after it was revealed that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite series of which he is a screenwriter and one of the stars, along with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to air, and it seems that Kiernan plans to dedicate his life to the aftermath of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in the "growing restaurant business in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will grant it access to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a sea centre full of cranes in La Paz.
The flag of the color of the ocean has been reported on public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are wings: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to bring him back.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost coastline in favor of Chile during the resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive – just as much as the longing for re-seaways in the Pacific Ocean.
Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after a five-year trial, and hopes may be at their highest level in decades.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice's verdict on the big screen and hope that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate a sovereign sea exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's verdict.
“We are on the cusp of returning the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The International Court of Justice’s ruling comes only six months after the final hearings, meaning the case “was not complex,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia’s interests, the last four years may have been backwards.
"The question of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales's warlike rhetoric buried every goodwill in Chile, he said.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court ruled unusually quickly.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia “an unprecedented opportunity to begin a new period in relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “break 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most favorite presidents – used the maritime issue as a political rodent.
“Bolivia will never renounce the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclearly disarmed if they could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
He made comments at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems willing to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of "flawed fantasies" and that U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will in no way bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to back the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s serious intention to renounce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal That The Last Line Of Large Headwear Is On The Way To A Luxury Shop In Your Neighborhood
Whether you want to upgrade your collection of hats or completely protect the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a line of crazy giant headwear for their spring and summer 2019 collection on the fashion track and delighted style lovers at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have worn Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention on the track.
The model that stood out was conceived by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide rim like feathers that completely "takes over" the heads of the model.
Other bulky accessories included jewelry-decorated watermelons, a wizarding hat, and even pineapple, but these accessories are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a breather and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow the big fashion statement – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
Huge hats fit perfectly with the heel "La Bomba", a straw hat with a circumference of about 60 cm wide that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat that conquered social media on the fashion track sent another big creation – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the swimsuit who wore it.
A saggy orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia crests and a white leather handle, was an exhibit in the Jacquemus' La Riviera summer collection for 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous and famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores for next summer. Since the designer has left such a strong impression, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories.”
John Edward: The Language Skills Citizens of the World Need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam results, with additional weight given by individual and joint successes in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the above-mentioned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the preferred and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest scores in languages were achieved by students of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students received an excellent rating for Mandarin, while 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest possible rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a lack of workforce with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs require language knowledge, these skills are key in a globalised world.
Regardless of the choice of career, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such a long-term skill.
A person who speaks several languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives him an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-digit percentage of respondents, namely 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for children today.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classic, modern languages in their program, while others will opt for languages that are considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are proficient in the field.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment in which they will learn to prepare and arm themselves with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future prepares us for.
The fact that in today’s global business world, language knowledge is very important for the future of every country, so it must also be reflected in education.
Thus, knowledge of modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer a choice of languages, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will play the Lakers for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his six-game Lakers pre-season plans.
"At this stage of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins his campaign with a number of gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned gatherings Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming election as there is a risk that Republicans will lose a majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump Conference in West Virginia online via live streams on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidate who sparked controversy over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate's affirmative decision has been on hold for a week until the FBI's investigation is over.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain an edge in the November election.
Trump’s presidential campaign headquarters said five meetings scheduled for next week aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to sustain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“The majority in Congress is so important to the president’s plans that they will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter a turbulent campaign,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
An evening rally to be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in a month. In that state in 2016 he won by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to help him improve his rankings in polls,” political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team left their heart on the field ahead of Sunday's individual matches
After three one-sided sessions, the couples' Sunday afternoon fight may have been just what it took to reverse the Ryder Cup.
"The wheel of luck turns" is a saying that is especially true in sports and in which athletes believe, especially in competitions like this.
Who is the lucky wheel favored by now?
“They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think luck is on our side right now,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are ahead with four points, while there are 12 points left until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouragement with his game in pairs with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after a whole day of play.
Spieth has played deadly from tea to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheering cheers became louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, culminating in the key path that Spieth took to the unresolved result.
After his 15-hole win, there was a similar cheerleader shout that recognized the hope and faith that Americans can turn everything around.
“You just need to concentrate and think about your game,” Spieth said.
All that's left for these players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who have won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
The European strange but irresistible couple has the maximum number of points and can not go wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari, show that they are exactly the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Paris’ Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
But it is still too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Alex Noren and Sergey Garcia, who had a great performance in this morning's couples game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes in the playground buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they failed to excavate.
However, on Sunday, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their holes.
It is fascinating to watch the games of pairs closely because you can see the interactions of the players in the pair, hear the tips they give and those they do not give, as well as study the strategy that can change in the moment.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and in the last day they come in with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary fighting, which some, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
Europeans on the last day of Ryder Cup enter with a lead of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's pairs games on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant 10:6 lead over the US.
Dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led by four points difference at Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy she missed in Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the U.S. team in the morning games in pairs, scoring 3:1.
The American team showed more fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already large.
To win the Jim Furyk trophy, teams must collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", are after a sensational weekend only the second pair to win four points in a pairs game in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they proved superior in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 win.
Woods, who failed to show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some brilliant moves, but now has 19 defeats of 29 games in fourballs and pairs and seven consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return to pairing with partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2&1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third-best player.
But the Europeans weren’t quite as greasy during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Sunday, putting their U.S. team at the top of the rankings.
They first defeated the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter by a 2&1 score in the fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy by 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in Ryder Cup history, the team that was behind four points managed to return in individual games, although Fury's team only needed a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days in the back, it seems that their Sunday counterattack will be hard to fall.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase distrust of the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea took “significant measures of goodwill” last year, for example, halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test station, and making a decision to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we don’t have faith in our national security. Under these circumstances, there’s no way we’ll be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's "gradual" approach to denuclearization, which would gradually lift sanctions on North Korea, his statement is significant because he has not rejected unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim made a promise to work on “the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump ensured the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearization be carried out before that and increases pressure through sanctions to enforce its goal, and even opposes the "declaration of an end to the war," Ri added.
“The perception that sanctions can throw us to our knees is just a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases distrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for the second Kim-Trump meeting the US president spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister noted that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held as many as three meetings in the past five months, adding: "If South Korea had sought denuclearization, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate."
Regardless, the tone of Minister Riya's speech was very different from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim "a man rocket" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea this year, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to disarm, but added that they still have a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea completes its denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time frame for denuclearization, adding: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have expressed their view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for the nuclear and ballistic program in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rome at the UN General Assembly and then said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him a few hours later because of "gangster demands."
North Korea has agreed to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex, which will be realized if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim had revealed that these "appropriate measures" relate to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a class to learn how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to fight the increasingly widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
Academician found that students at the world's best university often have no idea about the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea for the course came after he gave a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why did I learn this only now, in my last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and sporting success and generally improve health.
A professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Paul Barreira Health Service says the University decided to introduce the course after students were spotted with a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student bedroom where students have to click cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success, and how important a sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons is displayed that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in full-time learning before exams still exists, says the professor, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps in the fight against obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, throws it into a state of starvation and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler devise the course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As the next step, it plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar course of study before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered yet another defeat after Dolly Menge's shot blew Steven Gerrard's missing defense and ended the game with Livingston's 1-0 win.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first home win after winning in February and scored 4:1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team is now eight points behind in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the lead.
Menga scored a goal seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers seemed to have run out of inspiration and didn't seem to match the result.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only one goal difference behind the Hibernians.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after line-up judge Calum Spence got a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on the hips and thus clashed alongside Ayr to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingston line-up that the Hearts took last week and would be thrilled that his well-designed line-up stifled every opponent's attempt.
The Rangers may have had more possession of the ball, but Livingston achieved more with it.
They had a chance to score just two minutes after Menga was kicked out of the game for the first time, which opened up space for Scott Pittman to move towards Allan McGregor's goal, however, the forward missed that opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an inaccurate blow to the rear rows.
At one point, the Rangers took control, but in the final third of the game they seemed to be playing with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have sentenced him to eleven-eighth in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawles, but Judge Steven Thomson did not heed the Colombian's request.
In the first half, the Rangers were only able to point two balls to the goal, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not a big problem with Lassane Coulibaly's one-headed shot and Ovie Ejaria's pitoyable blow.
Although Livingston's 34-minute play has slowed the game, no one can deny their effort.
The Rangers once again failed to take advantage of Jacobs' deep return ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who retained the presence and chose Menga for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had an immediate effect as the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoy, while Lithgow and Halkett scored one long shot at a time.
Holt's side could extend the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide intake from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for an 11-year-old because he collided with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his gaze again this time.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now here's a page from our Almanach in the Sunday Morning show: September 30, 1882, 136 years and a few days ago ... the birthday of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has also become the main centre of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, in which the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the lead roles:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, and it’s used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms reacting to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “Look at that, you can hear it!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Bad Cells and Destroy Them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves the extraction of cells of the immune system from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
The cells are treated to “recognize” a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected into the patient.
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer withdrew for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting cells from the patient's immune system, altering them in the laboratory to "recognize" a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune system cells from the patient and their “learning” how to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, took part in the debates over Trump and supported him, wearing a cap that read, “Let’s Make America Great Again.”
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whispered in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a break-up performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a cap with the inscription “Make America Great Again,” he continued to speak out against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people so often and they tell me, ‘As much as you like Trump, he’s a racist.’”
"Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's speech was broadcast on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to tease West with the announcement.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was thrown behind the scenes because of the hat he wore.
“I was harassed behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
They harassed me!
They said I was drowned," the Washington Examiner reported.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and he said he'd wear his Superman coat because that means I can't tell him what to do. Do you want the world to progress?
Try it with love.”
Variety magazine wrote that his comments had caused at least twice public discontent, and members of Saturday Night Live seemed embarrassed, while one person told the magazine: "The whole studio was silent."
West was called in at the last minute as a replacement for singer Arian Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, stunned many.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "One of the most courageous people: THANK YOU for resisting the Mafia."
But the show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "his own and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing, or supporting his ‘art’) for whom I believe he accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the deceased musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted knife murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempting to murder a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear at the Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Star of the Game of Thrones series Kit Harington has turned to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for playing Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor turned to the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they need to be firm in order to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie from the Game of Thrones series, has admitted he wants to face the problem "very decisively".
“I personally feel very determined at this point – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, compared to the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, could be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is learned through television and on the streets, and why do boys feel that they need to have these particular traits of a man?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
“Something went wrong for the boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not film the sequel to the Game of Thrones series at the end of next summer and said he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a new performance of Sam Shepard's True West play, a story about the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the shoot of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife by filming that show, which gave me family and a future life,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow in an Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said that a person infected with HIV in this way is almost gone.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is high.
Research estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman because of conservative values in the country.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public gave away information about GOP senators, calling it “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
A Democratic MP from Los Angeles assures that these claims are spread by individuals of the “ultra-right wing” as well as websites.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The data allegedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released by an unknown Capitol Hill official during a Senate committee hearing over allegations of sexual assault by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address revealing the source of the disclosure belongs to Waters' office, as well as information about the representative's staff member, The Hill newspaper reported.
"These unfounded statements are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations – is by no means responsible for the leak of these data.
"These unfounded statements are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics on the Internet, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who is accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the prosecution.
He has to be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Barbara Walters' reaction to criticism from Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom they accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate competing against Waters in the general election, also announced on Twitter.
“That’s important if it’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies” of the false allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she said.
Review of the film "Johnny English: Again on a Mission" – not interesting enough Rowan Atkinson fights against spies
Now it is already common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems so in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel titled "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to the big screen in 2011 with the title "Johnny English" again.
Will the twisted own satire about how obviously worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English with squeaky eyes and a rubbery face again has permission to complicate situations, while the name more than anything tells him it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in the English language.
He is, of course, a freaking secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a "diluted" glamour, reminds him of Inspector Clouseau, has a breath of Mr. Bean's character and is somewhat reminiscent of the guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the 2012 Olympics and London Opening Ceremony.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and which is the embodiment of chaos.
There are one or two cool moments in this latest release of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the propeller hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie titles like "007" and "Impossible Missions" themselves offer elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for children, not for adults. In my opinion, Johnny English's crazy incidents are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's mute geeks embodied in the character of Mr. Bean.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is already a widely accepted fact.
The hacker has hacked into Britain's most secretive web spy network and uncovered the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, unfortunately briefly portrayed by Kevin Eldon.
It poured out a glass of the prime minister’s patience, an arrogant and belligerent character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson tries to faithfully portray the character she is supposed to represent Theresa May, but doesn’t quite get the material to do something with.
Intelligence advisers reveal to her that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English with his head and beard, who is currently employed as the headmaster of some high school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: here are a few handsome geeks because English teaches rock-style espionage.
Englisha is quickly brought to the government room for an emergency meeting, where she meets again with Bough, her former partner and her eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are all doing everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bullet, incarnated by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the villainous Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their thrilling journey with absurd and ridiculous odds: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, provoke a huge mess by smuggling into Volt's luxury yacht, and English provokes complete anarchy by trying to use virtual earphones to create a virtual earphone.
Everything has been done properly for this last sequel, but as attractive as the film was, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Pretty central accomplishment.
And as was the case with other films about Johnny English, I wondered again, can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is working out a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan that the British would work four days a week and be paid for five days of work.
The party allegedly wants corporate bosses to pass on the savings made by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could “fit” into the party’s economic agenda and plans to make the country favor workers’ interests.
The trade union congress supported switching to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
“The four-day working week will not take place overnight, but it represents an aspiration that fits with the approach this party has towards balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this aspiration.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy and the party is not considering it.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s Labour Party conference to elaborate his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to seize power from "unemployed directors" and "profiteers" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire stake because the Labour government could make “deductions” based on the irregularities observed.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent of private companies’ capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a chance the FBI would uncover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after you were quoted, and asked, 'Have you done that?'
He was determined, unwavering, unmistakable.”
Graham's voice, however, was carved in stone.
"I'm determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really should have a strong charge to change that," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has resolutely denied everything,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she appointed could confirm her allegations.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free event ticket (unless they were willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to the world leader, phone calls or any other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal.
But how successful is the Global Citizen, given that it has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – where people feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet they are really making a difference?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters who have striven to achieve a variety of goals.
It claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition,” a UK investor-operator partnership that is committed to “helping children develop to their full potential,” along with the promise that after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens of the world, it will provide the region with $35 million in targets per Rwandan aid.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Foundation, to audiences at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “The Power of Nutrition” project that will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on his website that reads: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult journey; sometimes we will experience failure.
But we will succeed, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us have succeeded, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performances at this year's New York event to be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy as a “blockade” to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner weekly.
Zinke said Russia's involvement in Syria, especially where it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in that area as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and blockade, if necessary, to make sure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which presents itself as an “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, and for Russia he says it is “using the same trick” in fossil-fuel-dependent economies.
The statements came at the same time as the Trump administration’s intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position prompted a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "seriously considering" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after a midterm election.
During an immediate meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office herself.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that implies a woman at the head,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is leading in the wrong direction."
“I’m terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most Warren voters don't think she should run for office in 2020.
According to a study by the Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Policy Research, 58 percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of the votes for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrat names discussed in connection with a potential 2020 presidential race are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident that took place on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, is comparable to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” she told audiences at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem, and for her son and other war veterans, she said that "they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back asking if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the army, have done."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interference with domestic violence reporting and possession of alcoholic weapons, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasille City Police Department.
18 states and the D.C. support a review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the county filed a friendly report Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner and "violent members of his gang" had abused her, but U.S. officials declined her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has changed the Immigration Committee’s 2014 decision to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires that all applications for asylum be settled on the basis of the concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the court’s friend’s report said.
Lawyers further argued that a policy that denies immigration harms the U.S. economy, saying it is more likely to become an entrepreneur and “secure the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum in June to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting more and more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," Risa Kusuma, 35, said as she comforted her boy, who had a fever in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water."
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, sweeping through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwij Haris, who suffered a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested outside the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors for continued severe subsequent earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking a hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "harming" with "propaganda ads"
A week after official Chinese newspapers published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday commented on a paid addition to the Iowa best-selling newspaper China Daily, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described in a statement to Reuters as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China “is now doubling this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press to place paid ads on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, you will find limited voices of opposition on the streets of Beijing and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the disturbing Chinese economic trajectory because the media are under the strong pressure of the Communist Party of China,” the statement said.
He added that "some of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were in question.
Kavanaugh's debacle: Republicans push voters ahead of midterm elections, analysts warn
With many Republicans standing by and defending Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding the event were quite agitated, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things cannot come back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University College in Syracuse, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher expressed suspicion that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, “November is coming!”, protesting in the Senate hall as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee prepared to continue Kavanaugh’s appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be beyond expectations,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news.
“People say they’re already at a high level, which is true.
But they could also be higher, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court judge candidate, analysts hint that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
“This is a real mess for the Big Old Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News at the beginning of last week.
“It’s not just about voting in the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, it’s about how the Republicans approached it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told reporters.
However, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after testifying to Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning towards him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in the truthfulness of Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh is safe or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for Supreme Court judge showed her her genitals at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for downloading Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee’s open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and the people who will be allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, thinking about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal network storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, duty lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is the decision of who can access which information is completely user.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with the resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world were able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they would introduce a complete change in which all of their business models overnight would be completely reversed.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a press release, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the award of the First World War clergyman with the Victorian Cross
Celebration in honor of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter in World War I was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had received the greatest British military honor.
A memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's undertaking for which he received that recognition.
On 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire coming from the battlefield and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the front lines and with "incredible courage" led the unit forward before, without anyone's help, rushing to the Polish cannon and killing three of the military squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s works were “something I know I could never achieve, and that inspires humility.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be taking part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Mixed martial arts lovers stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got the Pig Peppa
Imagine this: stay awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches so that you will eventually be unable to track the main event.
The San Jose program consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they were broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in Britain were in shock when the broadcast was interrupted by Peppa Pig.
Many were not impressed at all after they remained awake until the early hours of the morning just because of the fight.
One fan of the children's cartoon interruption on Twitter described it as "some kind of sick joke."
“According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Yup, ask Peppa."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said he would align his schedules to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I consider the reprimand, I think we can probably fix something,” Coker said.
“But the broadcast is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until we have a Sunday, when they will already have a Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many correspondences circulating that weren't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a state problem.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six, which we usually do. We tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's an unfortunate circumstance."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ to Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school he was not aware that “not everyone is like me.”
In a statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, headed by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that winning the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off from her illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverna's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" during his growing up than others because "it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls."
He said, “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference from others have been the right things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a prominent LGBT advocate and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt he was happy that he could live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you’re so young, you’re going through so much,” he recalled his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, saying it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, all the stories would be about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
“Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had gotten tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be here long enough to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he breathed out, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally become aware that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that’s what I’ve dreamed of my whole life to jump in front of the home audience at the Olympics, there wasn’t a better feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for the selection of the first song <0xCC><0xB6> "Proud" by singer Heather Small <0xCC><0xB6> that resonated in it during the preparations for the Olympics and which she always gets angry at.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is out of shape at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to fully recover to avoid an awkward turnaround.
Mickelson, who plays a record twelfth time in this two-year competition, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's games with four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and elaborating on his play at the training ground in the hopes of rectifying what was troubling him.
Never the most precise player, even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National, where long uneven terrain routinely punishes inaccurate strikes.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson is in the ninth match on Sunday against the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who won all four games this week with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man more than that and could not say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.”
He is famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I figured there'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought that's what we should do.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for the number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence also brought certain intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for that," he said.
“I think the younger players had fun with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows Big Advantage May Soon Disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the big advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup individual matches can easily be turned into an uncomfortable race.
The Dane made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where the team of Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 <0xCC><0xB6> 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow difference,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 National team win by 6 points in 5th and 3rd.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will play at full strength.
Go out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing is finished until the floors on the board are announced.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who is standing in front of us – the biggest players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in front of the ore in this.
Tomorrow we have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow is the big day, and that's something completely different.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you’re there as an individual, your golfer’s abilities are on the ultimate test.
This is a message you have to pass on to the players, and she is that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your teammate because he too has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with their teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those big turns of the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that advantage goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
Accordingly, we organized our setup and placed the guys as if, you know, we were going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned a task to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter face the other Europeans in the top half.
I decided that this group of guys goes in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of the selected players for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship put on hold again
The latest German navy frigate was due to be launched in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but it will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems hit the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels, ordered by the navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As it is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period <0xCC><0xB6> it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships <0xCC><0xB6> which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power abroad <0xCC><0xB6> will become obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unhappy F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to let the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors <0xCC><0xB6> less than the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, the ship has been shown to be dramatically overweight, reducing its efficiency and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be 7,000 tons heavier than the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project <0xCC><0xB6> including the training of the crew <0xCC><0xB6> also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy was actually "lacking ships capable of deployment".
The official said that this problem has increased over time, because the old ships were put out of service, and there were no replacement ships.
He expressed regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
The National Foundation is eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
New research on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
There is hope that the results will explain the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow ordinary and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-tailed and river bats in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile scans using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of bat voting and what species does.
A habitat map and report will then be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as creating meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are endangered by construction and decoration works that affect shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of pet cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of bats that inhabit Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal area for them.
“Here in Threave we have a huge space for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitats.
However, there’s a lot more we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us better understand what they need to progress.”
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since the unintentional destruction of a single bed can kill up to 400 females and young, thus likely destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scottish Flea Protection Association, urged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply don’t know how their population is progressing.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
An attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner on camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the footballer added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was "a good guy" who was disappointed by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual intercourse, but that he was consenting.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and was photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated".
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he switched to the Italian giant Juve as part of a move worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will "repent forever" of losing car manufacturers
The UK will "repent forever" if it loses its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that in the event that Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of waiting at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston engine produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal, we will experience production stalls at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal due to possible consequences for cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Minia factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers relates to the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the "on-time" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota’s Derbyshire plant would not be able to hold more stock than needed for a day, the company said, and production would be halted.
Clark said the "Chequers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
“We have to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers shows that we absolutely need to be able to continue this very successful supply chain chain.”
Toyota could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs go, they never come back again.”
A government spokesman said: “We have come up with a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in the election, the links between Trump's associates and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been plaguing rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the allegations.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid announcements that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not been set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything.”
Some journalists would have disputed this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference at the White House on September 10.
Chief Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not a result of the reluctance to “theatrical behavior” of television reporters, although she said, “I will not oppose the fact that I am swayed.”
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president organizes more meetings to answer questions than any president before him,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We have analyzed the numbers.”
Short speeches will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask a question to the President of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make this possible often, as you have seen in the last few weeks, and the very fact that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace brief addresses to journalists.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the gathered journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The health minister sent a letter to EU staff employed by the Scottish NHS to express gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to cover the costs of applying for EU residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued, moving towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up player Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a Saturday's loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31–27, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
“He got to the line of the playground and just crashed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and sending him for further testing.
A Tennessee State University spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had recovered from surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were "no details on the type/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with a two-year playing career, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five defeats before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 defeats per season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK
Under the new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK, and the additional money will be used to help the homeless.
This step will neutralize the success of Corbyn's effort to attract young voters.
An increase in the fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be understood as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The tax increase will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will contribute to the government’s efforts to fight homelessness.
The additional fee <0xCC><0xB6> that is charged to the current fee, including an increase imposed two years ago on other homes and properties purchased for issuance <0xCC><0xB6> can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents who do not reside in the UK, raising prices and making it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the society of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused major construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the land, and urged May to give up quotas on affordable real estate to repair “the shame of the housing situation” in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including housing controls and an end to unprovoked decommissioning.
He also wants to give councils greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to renewing the British dream that the lives of each new generation should be better.
And that implies repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be correct that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as valuable Britons.
The dream of owning a home has gone too far for a large number of people, and the shame of being homeless is still very real."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to one day become the governor of Scotland.
Scott (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren to the Scottish Football Championship again last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and that always drew me back.
But this opportunity could only be realized if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
The former head of Alloa Athletica says he didn't feel fear because he inherits such famous names in such a large club, after previously refusing calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this point will be measured by whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there.”
Ross is only completing the third year of his managerial career, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months of experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the drop to the champions' title winner next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalled taking over Alloe.
“I really believed that driving was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, earning solidly and enjoying quite successful moments.
The game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I’ve always wanted to drive, and now I do. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I’ve ever felt in my life.”

The perfect time for a pint is at 17:30 on Saturday, as research shows.
The summer heat wave has boosted revenues for British pubs struggling with finances, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw revenues rise by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the Office of the Chief Accounts Controller’s Business Consultation, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the good weather and England’s participation in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be more similar to the previous month in June, when the revenues of the pubs were more than 2.8 percent higher than expected.
A decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant revenue in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where most drinks are served have achieved much higher profits on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs serving mostly food have also been hit by the heat, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% during the month, and food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for vacation and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with difficulties, although a drop of 4.8 percent in annual sales will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.

One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
Research reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
The news has heightened the fear of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that they show their parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to a photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a cleaned “main” account to show their parents while also having private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager stimulating others with the words “force me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC), found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of which admit to owning private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “The worrying thing is that many teens are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athlete" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the annual assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is the most honored Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making her a member of the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of the sport and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m race at the 1996 Atlanta Games, out of his total of four Olympic gold medals, is now a regular BBC expert, after a transient ischemic attack he could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I will recover and to what extent.
It was strenuous, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again and today for the sake of agility exercise!
"Thank you for your encouragement messages!"
Divided opinions on the Internet about an advertisement for a traitor comparing mothers to cows
A publishing company with its advertising that compares mothers breastfeeding their children with cows that their husbands aroused has divided opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product that is claimed to be the “first silent wearable publisher in the world,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to showcase the freedom the new publisher gives mothers.
Four mothers dance in a stall full of hay and cows with music whose lyrics are: "Yes, I'm a man myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't a wime, it's my breasts."
Then there’s the saying, “Pump, pump, I’m feeding the baby with it, pump, pump, I’m feeding my ladies.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "terror" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen a few days after birth,” one person wrote.
Traitor Elvie discreetly fits in breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “Understandably traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors to mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added: “Completely stupid advertising.”
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that her song was "smiling".
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The milk delivery made me feel just like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I understand it as it is.
“This is a brilliant product,” she said.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at moms who give milk (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women who give milk say they feel like cows.
Traitor Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “Elvie’s betrayal is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between the depiction of women and cows, we wanted to focus on betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new betrayer will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvis has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has risen, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration's heavy rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested earlier were not recorded in the criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of the sponsor in the country are illegal, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
According to shelter workers, with the aim of speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the earlier standard.
Many will appear via videoconferencing, not in person, to bring their case before the Immigration Court for legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria will be deported.
According to the statements of shelter workers and reports that emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Proponents said these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, signs that the child is struggling are likely to be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "in accordance with this, they will be treated".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left without their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel rebel rebellion has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a mass attack by Syrian forces with Russia's support on a province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda, "which will be eradicated".
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why will Trump win a second term?
According to that logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the revocation and scandal end prematurely in his presidency.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidency final ever!”
There are currently no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, viewership in the hit term has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on a hit date, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed viewers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor,” about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of the comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, "Because he's making me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said.
There is a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the abortion law stemming from the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, you surpass the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of the "deep background" for his book Fear, about Paul Manafort's jacket of dwarf leather, a $ 15,000 suit, and a Trump suit.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
“Part of what makes you experience it as a reality show is that it feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show ‘Zelagonica’, about the rotating cast and daily intricacies of Kim’s show.

When I got to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his house on the north coast of Kauai Island it was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27°C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
He could not separate himself from the TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was about to end.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside left in the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a money flood, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
This recently rebuilt suburban district of Pittsburgh highlights Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a spot in the second district last spring in a special election.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district kicked off a fight to fund a campaign between the main party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely followed March special election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
That position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point lead.
Political analysts have given little advantage to the Democrats.
The United States decides whether El Salvador should be punished for providing support to China, and then withdraws.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to invite U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue on to a similar gathering last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the movement of migrants to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear they wanted the conference to be held and thus actually discontinued any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
The History
The next thing to be prepared could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very substantial evidence available to the public.
Mr Mueller reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr Trump’s campaign was secretly negotiated with Russia as part of its attack on our elections.
If a majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body just as he prepares to stand again before the electorate, and perhaps eventually with a jury of his own.
There are many such "if" and I do not want to suggest that the inevitable fall of Mr Trum - or those like him in Europe - is.
We all need to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now facing several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these newspapers reported that he secretly suggested filming the president last year and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently ordered investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it has been confirmed by the Supreme Court despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?”
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress that will call Mr. Trump to account?
If we fall on those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we will not fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy house.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with a crooked cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers on Thursday hosted Rapid from Vienna, knowing that defeating the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrelo earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for the Group G European League.
A knee injury prevented teammate Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and we pulled out a point.
Maybe we could have stolen the game in the end, but, generally speaking, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there’s a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; training is good.
Let’s hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Nationalwide’s vice president of life insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out a way to pay for those costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value that will help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your own wealth <0xCC><0xB6> as long as you have the money.
Arrange your legal documents: At the root, prevent legal battles.
Hire health care professionals to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Also, consider granting authority to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your bills if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asked.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Keep that plan in hand.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by an air rifle while returning home after leaving at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with an increase expected.
As communications were interrupted, relief officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggala province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009 - A 7.6-degree earthquake strikes Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidia Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reporting and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by an Alaskan state police officer.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su’s custody and is held on an uninsured $500 bond.
He appeared at the court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocent, of course", when questioned about pleading guilty.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, meaning he could be in prison for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time that Palin's criminal charges have been filed.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with reporting domestic violence and possession of alcoholic weapons related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Networks for electricity and communications have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake hit the immediate vicinity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of New York Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare federal crime sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a truck to rent a Home Depot store to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who found themselves on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saip’s federal grand jury struck a 22-point indictment that included eight murder and extortion charges, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov conducted it as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruji, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching a video of ISIS on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to accept the admission of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of a Eurosceptic as one of the MPs suggested there should be a negotiator with the European Union.
Conservative lawmaker Peter Bone said the Birmingham marches would have "go out" by now if Mr Farage had been secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is underscored by Tories prone to the remainder who join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister tries to maintain her “Chequers” compromise plan amid an attack by Brexit supporters, by the rest and by the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to "discard Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have gone out by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to kick out Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bone rejected allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain completely inaccurate.”
Conservative and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also in the procession, addressing reporters with the words: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually those who took to the streets and elected us.
Please drop Chequers and start listening."
In a note to May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they fulfill their promises.”
Farage told the gathering that politicians must “feel the pressure” if they are going to disappoint the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us people and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘it won’t pass you.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing this country's people's army that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remnant marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour gathering in the city centre.
Many activists waved banners “Tories against Brexit” after launching the group this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives over the security issues they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the ‘Canada plus plus’ plan, for the unhindered state at the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s all a farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to 'Seriously Consider' Candidate for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a direct social gathering with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been at the center of speculation for some time now that it could oppose Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
He asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that implies a woman at the head.
Arrested for murdering LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, L.A., announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims that took place on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, seeking help identifying the man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime and possessing a weapon and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The Sims, a 198-cm-tall third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in last season's 10 first sets and averaged 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after his order ensures victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team would "play a big role in the race".
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went to boxing and left Hamilton to get into traffic at the start, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered boxing one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action wheel on wheel which caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior free in danger of falling behind after a double move in defense of the third corner.
Max Verstappen left the last row and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race as he relied on his tires to reach a fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally reached boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was tough because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team has done a really great job of achieving the formation finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “bad and ugly and dishonest.”
“The only thing that can happen and the nice thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at publications and leaks of information to the public, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leave the information?
Remember her response... did you release the document to the public – ‘aa, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let ... No, we did not,” he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that information had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t make her story public,” Feinstein told the board.
“She asked me to keep her a secret and I kept her a secret, which she asked for.”
However, her denial did not meet the approval of the president, who at the meeting on Saturday night commented: "Let me tell you something - it was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see evil, disgust, they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they’re going to have to overwhelm in order to get to power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for their defeat of the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5–3 win in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead in the early minutes with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a draw, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, and the Giants won in the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening game came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with the assistance of Kendall McFaull, with the assistance of David Rutherford to double the lead by hitting Beauvillier four minutes later.
In the hurried opening of the game, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt enabled Cownie's draw at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with the lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The homers regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to a tie in the scoring with a goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee in the second-third, and he made sure of the win when his team was already halfway through the last third of the game for the fifth time.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will host the Milton Keynes team in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers on Plane Avoid Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been declared a hero after he died while securing the safe takeoff of the plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a large earthquake hit Sulawesi island on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at the swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained to ensure the safe takeoff of the Batik Air aircraft on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken because of this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Sigyu and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to increase, as many bodies are still under debris and many could not even be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances bring bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is looking for survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Now Says One Man Is Left As Missing After Airplane Crash In Lagoon
The airline, which owns the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one man is being reported missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had been unable to trace one of the passengers since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in attempts to locate the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane flew very low.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to break through the water that climbed up to their waist to the exit in the event of a plane sinking.
He said the stewardesses panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair the dock also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in the accidents of air carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini.
Analyst presents timeline of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday concluded a re-trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to compile a puzzle about the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location information from several phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she was killed, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was at the same location as Chambersin at the time he allegedly was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lieing because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense should begin the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Aware Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based singer group The High Breed claims hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings, filled with political messages and focusing on social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York babysitter sues a couple over 'racist' resignation
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from a mother calling her “another black woman.”
The couple denies they are racists, comparing the allegation to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned on her first working day in 2016 that the new nanny of her children, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
“No, there’s one more black woman,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "unpleasant" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, because, she claims, their former nanny, who was an African-American at the time, was doing her job poorly, and that, instead of her, she was expecting the New Post of the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then she went home.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for the six-month period for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they were racists, saying that ending Maurice's employment was reasonable to do, fearing that they would not be able to trust her later because of the insult.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her in a message.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
“Would you trust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of her child and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“You’re going to sue someone who’s in that situation.
“That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still underway, a public opinion court quickly convicted the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Won't Identify With Talking Bear, Reveals New Letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who will read the book for the first time before publishing.
It’s very funny what we now know about Paddington’s huge success.”
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC filmmaker before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with happiness and sadness after his death.
About Paddington, who she describes as a "very important member of the family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t a boaster,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was all experienced as an achievement of his own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is really your work.
I think Paddington's success was viewed that way.
Although it was about his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit exclusively to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was urgently transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Then he called regularly to say that it was really bad and that they believed he would not get away with it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
Medicines given to her by doctors to maintain her heart rate slowly lost their effect and left her body system.
She died shortly before boarding, and then everything went out.
I just had to sit back and wait knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all in me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers – who were not aware of the temptations she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I lowered my head, and tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Messages of women mourning on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Ms. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with an infectious smile awaiting a brilliant career.
“Everyone remembers him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy.
However, before his death, he left his job because he was in a “really dark state.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that this will have a negative effect.”
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with the cards “so people would know that there is someone you can go to and talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner she had been with for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt sad, depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye or want anything else.”
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to overcome it: “All this leaves a great hole in the family.
He's kidding us.
But we'll keep going and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
"I thought maybe we could bring a little unity if we could really get something like what he was asking for - a time and scope-limited investigation," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "disintegrate" amid a rooted party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resentment is driven by the choice of the moment.
Midterm elections are coming in just five weeks, Nov. 6, if, as expected, Republicans do not go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to bring the desired man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is constantly inviting senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
There are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break with a decisive vote and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Koreans 'fall' under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Referring to data from the United Southern Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 escapees last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors are tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more taxes smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of refugees from the north eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them violently.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearisation talks.
This came after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work in a broader sense to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's foreign minister, blamed U.S. sanctions for not making any progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is not considered that under such circumstances we will be the first to disarm," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', says he is incapacitated to serve in Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if she ever acted like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the introductory remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost yelling and choking as he discussed his family and high school age.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and coordinated defamation” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because he showed prejudice against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would try to revoke Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats got a majority in the House, Pelosi stepped back.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only capable of being in the Supreme Court, he’s not capable of being in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or abortion law stemming from the Roe v. Wade case because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about whether he would revise some Supreme Court rulings.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justifiable criticism, the anger that has accumulated for months and years, cannot be eliminated without pay.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What do you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was once the CEO and who said that she cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.'"
And then she continued.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs, in an office dominated by men, is how, once when I was crying for unspeakable anger, an older woman, a cold manager, who I was always a little afraid of, dragged me up the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-designed decision,” she told me through laughter 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn’t need another one.
Someone called them "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already been delayed, she lagged behind in raising funds, vowing not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she asked.
While she said she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so obsessed with emotions of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with a system that made it harder to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism that she squeezed her throat.
“You would think I had experienced a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media reaction to her.
“You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone.
“She was crying.”
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Be Good for Beijing
The beginning of a trade war between the United States and China has echoed loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the rift between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week emerged with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of products, in fact taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in some way each time, and recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on US $60 billion in goods.
China has promised that it will respond to the U.S. with a blow, and the world's second-largest economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Washington’s withdrawal could be achieved by indulging in demands, but public obedience to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for an economic collapse in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a U.S. strategic thinking scientist who focused on Asia.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild a country devastated by a more than seven-year-old war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to restore the normal situation.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and existence have now been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 <0xCC><0xB6> 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive European titles and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown while Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled almost the entire tournament, on the 16th hole pair 3, sent the ball into the water on the first shot, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players ever to reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was kicked out by Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranked player of the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most-winning European in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stop my tears.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the cup again.
It’s all up to the team. I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said, full of emotions after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Rama, who defeated legendary American golfer Tiger Woods in Sunday's individual games with a score of 2&1.
"I'm incredibly proud to win over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and is right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team’s disappointing performance, U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.”
At times, we have resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna go overboard, I'm gonna work with the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take the hat off to people.
We're overthrown."
New data on red tide: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
