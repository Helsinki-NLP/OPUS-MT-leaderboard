The social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the preservation of the travel benefit in public passenger transport.
Since September 24, the procedure for organizing a preferential visit of citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region has changed.
According to the press service of the Government of Russia in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the benefit for travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 FZ "On the national payment system".
At the same time, the social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its use are changing.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now set not in trips, as before, but in the amount of funds, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in the winter no more than 400 rubles, in the summer period - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of the social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of money.
The cost of a preferential trip for citizens will be 1/2 of the fare applicable to the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for replenishing the social card with cash remains the same - from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, there is an opportunity to keep a detailed account of the spending of money on the social card with accuracy up to kopecks.
In addition, there is a possibility of reimbursement of registered but unused funds.
We also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half the cost of the trip is paid by the citizen, and the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier budget.
No commission will be charged when depositing on the card of cash.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road Economy and Transport of the Ivanovo region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social map, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
More than 470 million rubles are provided in the regional budget for providing citizens with a preferential pass using a social card.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
A 911 teacher confesses to killing a friend.
During a phone call to 911, Shannon Lamb, a professor at the university, told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that he needed staff to come home.
Lamb said there was a "dog" in the house that was alive, but probably upset, and said the contacts of the family members of the deceased could be found in her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note negligently written by hand on a white sheet of linen paper: "I'm so sorry, I would like to bring everything back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who has ever loved me."
Nothing indicates that Lamb, who took two online courses at the University of Delta State in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then managed to travel 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot all the respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Baford said the shooting was reported at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call to 911 shortly after that.
By the end of the day, there will be one more victim: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officials were still trying to put together the motives behind Lamb.
The information shared by investigators in both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped create a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students said they were eagerly awaiting his classes.
Police in Gothenburg, where Prentiss was killed, said he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed gratitude for the "beautiful people" he had met in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who was well-reviewed about Lamb, reported that he also appeared anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he was dealing with stress.
Lamb had earlier asked the University of Delta State to grant him a sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university admissions rules meant that the degree of the doctor, on which Lamb worked so diligently, would not guarantee him the automatic receipt of the position of a teacher.
William Laforge, the university's president, said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "apparently Mr Lamb had something in mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after he escaped from campus as he headed back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb was shot with a 38-caliber reloaded gun in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Metell Johnson said.
His engine-powered car was still standing on the driveway.
It was immediately unclear why Lamb had come to the house, although, according to Johnson, she believed he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in that area.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful man.
Carla Hearston said she was 15 and Lambo was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who for several years tried to teach her to play the guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls melted when he was around,” says Harriston, who is now in her 40s and lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss seem to have been dating for some time at the time of the events.
During a 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the record of their marriage is missing.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothia in a brick house, the reverse of which leads to the canal.
According to the police, the dog is okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Stain, said they were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and that they had a 19-year-old daughter.
"She's completely depressed," O'Stine said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stain said he hadn't met Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together at concerts from time to time.
O'Stain said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and co-host of entertainment programs at the dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the suburb of Gothie, said the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss was on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lipstick for the few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and made fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very clever.
Schmidt, a late teacher, led seminars for first-year students and specialised in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the Student Brotherhood and Student Self-Government.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, took part in the candlelight memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is a day of recovery.
Amy and Rohelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was co-authored by Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamb's call came to 911 service after Schmidt's murder, as well as in connection with the fact that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, with a toy and children’s goods retailer assuring that it will give staff and temporary employees the opportunity to work longer hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, which is less than the 45,000 that were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing the applicants this month and will increase staffing from October to December.
Although a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff in order to have enough staff in stores and for the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about a "meeting" with Princess Diana
The premiere of “Back to the Future” turned out to be a grand event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the movie theater waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me was free, and here I was shaded - there will be Princess Diana next to me," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The movie starts, and here it comes to mind that I am literally at a distance of an outstretched hand and in one false zewk from a date with Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" - a documentary about the film "Back to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The film "Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
“For me,” Spielberg says, “this is undoubtedly the greatest time travel film ever made.”
“Back in Time” will be available on VOD, DVD and at some theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
In response to Russia’s military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and that the rise in arms would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The head of the United Nations once again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during this month's ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
He regretted that disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, “made the situation insoluble.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity as they have shown in addressing the Iranian nuclear program and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show that Donald Trump is not joking
Some have tried to label him a provocateur.
Others turned away from him, taking it as a joke.
Some people want a scandal.
But no matter how some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump’s high position in the polls, they haven’t succeeded (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have demonstrated Donald Trump’s advantage in two-digit numbers, and some are starting to seriously ask what it means for the real estate magnate in terms of chances of getting a nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate for the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his advantage to gaining popularity to Hermann Kane, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Political Activity Supercommittee and the economic conservative Growth Club recognize Trump’s unwavering power and begin to deliver their dollars to overturn him.
Here are some survey figures that suggest that the real estate magnate is not just an intermediate phase:
Trump’s sympathy ratings are up 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans were positive about the real estate magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans are now in favour of Donald Trump.
Approximately three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators peak in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are pro-Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would nominate Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two in 10 say they would be “disappointed” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” against 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
Next level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio has only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be “unhappy” or “disappointed” if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t consider Trump’s temperament a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of Republican-sensitive voters across the country think the magnate has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country’s first closed assembly in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be the commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he’s not the person who can be effective in office, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Republicans are accustomed to this idea.
When they put on their hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious about it.
When asked who is the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s no longer the case when four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had not had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle of the cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported potential candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to rally around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a spread is likely to play in Trump’s favor, and at the same time non-Trump supporters are evenly distributed among the supporters of more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives majority support.
He surpassed Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He has a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's around him?
Ben Carson overtook the businessman by as many as 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one competition.
A little over half of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters who support Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump’s most intense competition at the moment is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violators” two months ago in his campaign opening speech, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant topic in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s posing will distract key voters of Latin American descent from the Republican party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts public attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment with the government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday said in a new ABC/Post poll that they want a political outsider rather than a person with experience in government.
And they are also offended by Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican activity in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "in rage".
The government will decide the fate of the indexation of pensions in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodez said that the government is now looking for options for the implementation of the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 on the real level of inflation.
She noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, when the draft budget for the next year is submitted to the Government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision on freezing the accumulative pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is equal to 350 billion rubles.
That’s about the same as indexing pensions in full for the next year.
According to the deputy prime minister, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
Golodecz believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why do I often get irritated and redden my eyelids?
Answered by ophthalmologist Tatyana Levashova:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
By forgetting about the regular cleansing of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis ourselves.
The exit is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, carry with you a special damp napkin for the eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day clean the edges of the eyelids from accumulated in them per day harmful substances.
Cleansing procedures need not be supplemented with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (salfey, chamomile), diluting the thick secretion of sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out with circular movements of the finger cushions;
When washing makeup, do not use alcoholic beverages.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to even greater thickening of the sebaceous gland secretion.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear weapons have created an atomic warhead.
North Korea said the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yonben nuclear complex, was operating "at full capacity".
The report appeared on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
The DPRK is ready to respond at any time to the "aggression and nuclear threat of the United States", and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and quality".
The last test of nuclear weapons was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume full operation of the reactor have not been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims it has managed to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly conducted tests of medium and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian anthem the mention of brotherly peoples.
The leader of the LDPR Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the reference to the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
This was stated during the meeting of the State Duma, reports "Russian News Service".
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"Very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can not endure," - said Zhirinovsky.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quadrilaterals in which this line is contained:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God save the tsar", and the Russian tricolor should be replaced with an imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether or not Europe accepts refugees, but whether the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on the issue.
“This is the issue of refugees,” he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible as long as people die, as long as bloodshed continues and as long as people do not feel completely safe.
“So we can reach a consensus, but we can’t achieve anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,” Assad said.
About 500,000 migrants have arrived in the EU countries this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission said the current migration crisis in the world is the biggest since World War II.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe may be thousands of militants of the extremist group "Islamic State".
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The residents of the German city organized a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently stepped up border controls to contain their influx.
Authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts say the numbers are significantly higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn debuts at the Prime Minister's Question Session
After the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the session of questions the Prime Minister is expected with great anticipation
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon address the Prime Minister for the first time in a session of questions, for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six issues in the afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely followed by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he could miss some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test as a leader; it will take place after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Congress of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent while performing the national anthem in service on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, has sparked criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and has become the subject of several cutting-edge newspaper articles.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Corbyn’s spokesman said he “stands in a respectful silence” and acknowledged “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain.”
However, shadow cabinet member Corbyn Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing a national anthem "regardless" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbyn’s team, voiced disagreements on economics, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the MPs supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political disagreements will also be “stacked up” in the Labour Party after Corbyn’s appointment to a position in the European Union and the government’s limitations on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn said at the Trade Unions Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at lifting the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow minister of labour and pensions, said there was “full clarity” in the party that it was in opposition only to the government’s plans to reduce the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has met at the Courier Box in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, said he had "attracted collective resources" to raise ideas for Mr Cameron's questions and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from Eilington North County said the Prime Minister’s questions were causing excessive confrontation and that he would refrain from clever answers and swings, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the minister of economy in the shadow cabinet, will replace him on the Prime Minister's questions when he is absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak whenever possible, saying he had approached House Speaker John Burke to discuss the issue.
Becoming a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to step away from the political style of "fairy baguette", often associated with the Prime Minister's questioning procedure, but admitted a few years later that he failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, questions to the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of the views of the leader, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say it has turned into a cartoon and requires large-scale reforms.
"Shot in Joburg" Homeless young people who learned from photographers
The business center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for the homeless.

The pound sterling rises as wages rise in the UK
The pound grew against the backdrop of wage growth in the UK, while the FTSE 100 index rose thanks to an offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the highest since 2009, and was seen as a shift to an earlier period of forecasts for a possible increase in quotes.
The pound sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and by 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In the overall background, the shares of SABMiller rose by 20% thanks to an offer to buy from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would merge the world’s two largest brewery companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares grew by 0.9% against the backdrop of encouraging news from the rival group of luxury goods manufacturers Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales figures exceeded expectations and showed that sales in China – the key market for Burberry – began to grow again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it was able to raise $2.5 billion by placing shares, which was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The stocks of the Mondi Paper and Packaging Group were the leaders in the drop in the index - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell".
JD Sports shares rose after the sportswear company reported an 83% increase in pre-tax earnings for six months to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Prevent Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the rise in labor costs, he says.
The costs could have affected JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean reducing the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the pressure of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The bottom-up wholesale food supplier has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming $700 million merger by Aldi.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in the leading media and social media outlets.
The campaign is joined by IGA retailers and suppliers, such as Simmo’s from Dunsborough, which offers tasting in IGA stores, and store owners selling discounted tickets to South Australia Football League matches to regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29, the day when this wholesale supplier of food, alcohol and household goods will celebrate its annual investor strategy day.
In South Australia and Western Australia, stores under the IGA brand make up almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favourable to IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the South AA and 24 percent in the WA states compared to about 14 percent in the states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take back 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all present players, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kirat believes IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenue and sales of food products at the high level of constant costs of Metcash could cost the company about 13 million revenues before paying interest and taxes, says Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this is despite the fact that a recent Morgan Survey study found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash’s food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Lead Fund Manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told attendees at a Melbourne business lunch that Metcash “may likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash’s revenues from the food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 percent compared to 2012, due to operational leverage and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up by spending more than $150 million annually to match retail prices at Coles and Woolworths at a thousand positions per week and by helping IGA retailers reshape retail outlets, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh food products and a wider choice.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that price alignment and retail area refurbishment are gaining momentum, and hopes the company will achieve a net profit increase in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasy Kokkinakis supports Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasy Kokkinakis was indirectly injured in a recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more honor than critics for his behavior, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the junior in the talented duo and often referred to as "Special Ks", was inadvertently in the spotlight due to Kiryos' shameful encounter with Stan Wavrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly afterwards, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the referee on the tower had to shoot Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison declared: "The wizard had to put on the blades of Kiryos, and I had to put on the shovel of this".
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a rocket after a seizure in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly has been a loyal defender of Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be second after Bernard Tomich in the Davis Cup semi-finals against the United Kingdom.
"I am deeply concerned about one thing, namely that Tanasi was drawn into the conflict," Hilly said.
He really broke the rocket when he was kicked off at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break the rocket when hopes fell, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But in fact, he has mastered himself very well in quite provocative situations in the US, with Harrison and so on, and I’m sure he deserves to be trusted.
He’s surrounded by a great team, he has a wonderful family, and I just think he’s been treated a little unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, he fits well in the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected outside the court, he is intensely trained, he is in great shape, he is a very purposeful and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated for his dignity.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for the important match starting Friday, believing "mutual agreement" the right way out for everyone, but expecting the Canberra guy to return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not the disputes around [Kiryosa],” said Hilli.
And I think that Nick has gained strength very quickly, that proves people like Federer and Marray, he grows up in front of the public, he has made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism for all that he gets, but we are trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of you.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday closed its border with Serbia on the southern border and is detaining those who try to enter the country illegally to restrain the flow of migrants.
There have been riots at the border - hundreds of migrants have accumulated in the border territory, to which the Serbian authorities reacted strongly negatively.
Standing indefinitely on a stretch of road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence at home broke their tents and settled in the area.
However, dissatisfaction has increased.
When a police helicopter circled over them, migrants shouted “Open the border!” and shouted insults to the Hungarian special-purpose police.
Some, in protest, refused food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister has declared the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary "unacceptable" as more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not the accompanying damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the next day after the bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to bear joint responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) an agreement will be reached, according to which member states of the European Union will accept another 120,000 refugees, including refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that has swept across the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect swift action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum court cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sieyarto said his country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were connected to urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “narrow spot” and crossing point of the EU border for refugees, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life, rather than refugees - victims of military actions that have the right to protection, and this view strongly differs from the views of other EU countries, including:
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now consider it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, as well as include longer prison terms for traffickers.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltán Kovács told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Formally, the parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are at the border have been observing the presence of armed to the teeth soldiers with vehicles and dogs there for several days.
Orban’s national security adviser, Yerdi Bakondi, said 45 people were arrested by authorities trying to cross the border at the border, and another 15 inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities quickly rebuild the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passageways on the border with Serbia, driving a railcar wrapped with barbed wire to block one of the passageways.
The riots erupted on the main passageway across the border near the city of Ryoske (Hungary) as the Hungarians placed an office space to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break into it.
Approximately 20 people managed to penetrate inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would refuse food and water until they were missed in Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernard Sanders has halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-figure lead in the Democratic nomination race across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders catches up with her.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among primary Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of primary Democrat voters.
More than five months before the competition began in the primary elections, a majority of Democrats say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographics, and Sanders has earned some bonuses.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has diminished.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democrats up to age 50 has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton surpassed Sanders by a two-digit number among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
Nearly half of primary Democratic voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of primary Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republicans say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 percent), then that now is the time for the female president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also speak of an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9%).
It is also called consensus on issues and chances of election.
As the vice president is considering potential election participation, 57 percent of primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race — though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among party candidates, the primary Democratic voters in most cases call Biden.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to nominate himself from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the racers to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden has a long lag in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, answering the question of what is most important in a candidate, Democratic voters choose other options besides the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the Democrat candidates or potential candidates are an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown a good result on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of the three leads in honesty, and Clinton’s strength in leadership.
Thirty percent of primary Democrats don’t consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have a certain opinion about him in this regard.
Primary Democrats also generally consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden’s ideological views to be similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal mailbox and server as Secretary of State continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of this and feel that it has not negatively affected their overall opinion of her.
But this is a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public’s views on this diverged as early as March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers her party’s voters to be honest and trustworthy, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent consider her to be honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it fair and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, both get good marks in leadership qualities.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush showed the best result in honesty.
Most see Sanders as an honest person rather than not, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national poll Ben Carson close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
The two candidates scored half of the vote in a new poll, leaving everyone else behind in search of support.
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support rate has increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll on the eve of last month’s Fox News debate to 27% in a poll on Tuesday.
But Carson took off for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoyed support across all demographics, pushing Trump into a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, backed off along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together rank third with 6%.
The margin of error for sampling 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus-minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson’s rise in polls — showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In connection with Carson’s growing support last week, Trump made several critical remarks to the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need the energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign shutdown in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of Baruch College Primary School Student
About two years after the death of a college student during a fraternity dedication ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"P. Delta Psi Brotherhood members from New York College Baruch violently attacked Chan Michael Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to deliver him to the hospital in time, resulting in his death," police said in a statement.
Officials say the student with his eyes tied and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back pushed several times as he tried to reach the target, walking on a sliding surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
P. Delta Psi did not call 911 when Deng was unconscious and waited an hour before being taken to the hospital, police said.
They, however, took the time to change Dengue's clothes, find his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
“At this point, the fraternity members began hiding personal property, essentially putting the well-being of the fraternity above the health of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had several dumb head, torso and thigh injuries.
“Too many families have been affected by the rituals of fraternity initiation, as at least one student has died during them every year since 1970,” Douglas Feuerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe County's jurors leaned in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will face charges of violence against a newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to bring not only individual participants to account, but if there is an organization that has authorized all of this officially or informally, then so will it," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity excluded a local branch from its structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There will be a rise in rates, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will be before the attack and how long it will continue.
Specifically for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession occurred just 11 months after the first rate hike and for an entire 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
That’s why the U.S. Central Bank administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how long it will take to adapt.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that all the vanity around the rate hike is exaggerated.
“The Federal Reserve’s first rate hike with the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economics officer at Capital Economics, in his customer commentary.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of interest rates in the US to more normal but still low levels to be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy could react depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen over the past month or so, the expectation of higher rates can lead to instability for some time.
When the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“Equity earnings don’t seem to slow for 12-24 months after the first leap, which, again, probably reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve’s rate hike results.
If more specifically, the market over the last 35 years has changed more drastically by the management of the company - about 14 percent - in the direction of raising rates, remains fairly even for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to the normal state with the average return of 14.4 percent, not the last six cycles.
The results for securities tend not to immediately become more pronounced at the rate hike stage, and earnings from stocks are starting to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but higher rates often play a role in them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point in the lifetime of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it is long, while in the third quarter it remains at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against such a volatile economic backdrop can be risky and raises the question of "whether this time it will be different," Deutsche reported.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, with their views tied to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could have approved the rate hike at this meeting, futures trading suggests a mere 25 percent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all rate hike cycles to date have been in a supercycle of increasing leverage at GDP, overlapping the peaks pre-recession, very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle is the longest the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, it has been 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario is somewhat similar to that implemented for stocks.
The main difference is that for bonds, the effect will come faster than for stocks, when the Federal system changes the strategic price.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first rate increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike, bond yields are falling immediately,” reports Deutsche.
Strategic experts at Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will bring yield levels for long- and short-term bonds closer together, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of yield fluctuations,” says Katie Jones, a fixed-yield analyst at Schwab.
It is interesting that Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal system policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market with tightening policies of the Federal system.
In general, companies running their core business in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be in the worst position, as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space, and their debt more expensive - in financial.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks demonstrate performance above market performance within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a stable financial position bypassed firms with an unstable financial position by an average of 5 percentage points after each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as stocks with low volatility, also showed better performance than low-quality stocks, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will be a big issue.
Companies with a high rate of floating-rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM", - says Conservative Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "decreasing standards"
It proves that it is becoming less and less distinguishable from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was simply colluding with the Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who crashed into The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
“BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM,” the leader of parliament said, urging the broadcaster to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies are not doing.
Conservative Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public radio station seems to be “stupid” and becoming less and less distinguishable from its commercial competitor.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like to use the word ‘simplification’ — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that came to my mind first, in which you’re actually just copying what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC CEO denied the allegations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3 is that I don’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and making music is really unmatched by anyone else.
“It’s also really important, I think, the interest of Radio 3 in finding new music and promoting new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations had to work much more to attract an audience than in the past because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child to be attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Tory Member of Parliament Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch-based Talpa Media for an approximate price of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find the hit in its own home stable” the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales growth slowed to a maximum in August, and Black Friday may be the culprit
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase in online sales by seven percent
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that the November Black Friday could have contributed to the containment of spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain’s central streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of alignment of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase during the first three months of 2015.
Overall spending on online shopping in August has shown minimal growth since they began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by only five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of alignment of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the pace of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, they’ve always found a reasonable explanation,” said Andy Malkehi, IMRG’s sales index editor.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were given the opportunity to shop online, and that they could do so in any circumstances, such as sitting on a couch.
But now it’s going to the plateau, and you can see a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could have refrained from shopping on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers in an amount of five times the average rushed to computers to have time to take advantage of lucrative deals, thus knocking down a number of sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real fight for profitable purchases, could have made people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every 5 is spent online.
As for products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in fashion stores on the central streets.
Muslims bury the dead in the fall of a crane in Mecca, and the family of bin Laden imposed sanctions
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed for the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crash of the crane.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims killed in the crash of a crane at the main mosque in Mecca.
Wearing mostly white, those present at the funeral flooded the passageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who set off on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by the sacred place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for burial, and at the same time the Saudi king fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in the collapse of a crane in the Main Mosque, carried on the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of the crane raised when the crane was not working.
The Arab version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press, says Binladin Group bears partial blame for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not tell about this detail, but reported that the leaders of the company were forbidden to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the crane falling into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crane collapse, and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inappropriate coordination of actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
Bin Laden’s family has been among Saudi Arabia’s closest ruling family for decades and runs the largest construction projects.
The late al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, was the traitor's son, whom the family abandoned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to take part in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every working Muslim.
Officials said there were 158 people in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about <0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to the relatives of the deceased, and the same amount irrevocably mutilated.
The other victims will receive half of that amount.
Head of B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouses across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, head city correspondent Daily Mail
It is said that the British put aside hammers and paint brushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do homework.
If you know how to handle a hammer or cleverly paint the walls, it seems that these days you are in a minority.
Because, according to the owner of the company B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring specialists-masters to perform simple housework.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of home furnishing services, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in goods for masters, while closing 60 B&Q warehouses at the same time.
Laurie said she would like to see more women in the staff of B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by the weaker sex.
Most of the staff are now men.
According to her, the latest demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women, who are more engaged in arranging their homes than in the past, cannot be overlooked.
Mrs. Laurie said: "Our stores are still predominantly men.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of decisions about the goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laurie, one of the five women at the helm of leading British companies whose shares are listed in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of men and women among the directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of executives are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms. Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women on the board of directors was easy.
After the group took over the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the brands Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new stores
Time of decision on the U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate
The world is watching a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank, at which a crucial decision is being discussed within two days to raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade.
A poll of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who last week thought the Federal Reserve would go for it now believe it would still interrupt and keep the rate in the current range of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working efficiently, the economic upturn adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for the change, but it all hints at their confidence that all chances are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees are coming to the EU via Croatia.
"Open!" - chanted hundreds of refugees at the checkpoint Horgosh on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for displaced people.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to grasp other options for routes to the EU.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
Another - via Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that took refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovich assures that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure a humane attitude towards them.
But this is already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe alone can cope with it, and all the more a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is inflexible:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill in the necessary documents for this purpose.
And if he does not, then he will not be allowed into our country, because Serbia is quite safe.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometre fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop at this: he plans to erect the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: “Europe wants to help us”
Vangelis Meimarakis has been a member of the center-right governments for several years, which the left believes have led the country to a financial crisis.
Now that he has become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist named Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat by yielding to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, according to polls, “New Democracy” has equated with it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and a growth outlook.
The country now has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them out.
In the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation the country was in in January and the false promises of Mr Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare the promised with what actually happened.
Everyday life became noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this was the case for the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still being carried out, political forces and all governing parties have come together to implement the programme on which they have reached agreement, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country’s creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece’s move on the European path, because we have a good idea of the devastating consequences that a country’s exit from the EU would have.
Now Europe is helping us by granting subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of the way Tsipras negotiated.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government in the first year in power wants to bring order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement a rescue program, then I am sure that all the commitments that can be made cannot be fulfilled because of what is leading to a recession.
It would be a mistake to assume that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they are waiting for the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, while continuing to enjoy the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we need to open up for a better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many of the key political issues that we found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
Let me give you an example of the income of farmers.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Tsipras ministers never spoke about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and poorly informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Mrs. Hollande, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried to best implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners in it.
We have pushed reforms forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in an emergency.
The market fell, and there were no prospective buyers willing to pay the price agreed by the Greek government.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, I managed to agree on the opinions of the three parliamentary groups that made up the government majority at the time.
And despite their serious ideological disagreements on key bills, we had a working parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations taking place outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process were not interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential election.
Euronews: There has been a massive influx of refugees in Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think of this situation and the reaction of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a slow-acting bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters, you should act at the forefront, because if the problem hits you, then only emergency measures remain.
And we are in that situation right now.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA did more in just seven days than Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the Provisional Government, which is being assisted by the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will enable us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a deep humanitarian dimension, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We also need to make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mr. Meymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka of Donetsk region during the day, the officers of the criminal search of the Main Police Department of the region together with military counterintelligence established and detained the suspect, who was a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Kryvyi Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who on the eve of his evening

The man who opened the shooting at the University of Delta State, left a note with an apology
After his friend was shot and killed in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he “regrets” the first murder and would like to “return everything to the fullest.”
Police in the city of Gothie, Mississippi, reported that a professor of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta State called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said: "I killed my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "dog" in the house that "doesn't touch anyone" but is probably upset.
The police questioned the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shot.
Upon arriving at the scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like to bring everything back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and killed himself on Monday evening when he was surrounded by police.
University Rector William Laforge said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr Lamb clearly had something in mind."
Despite information Monday that Lamb was implying an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported the "lack of any information or evidence" of the "love triangle".
Prentiss was referred to as the "good man" Sean O'Stain, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Stain said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter and she was "consolated".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the San Gerald newspaper calls its close friend Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb called relatives at some point on Monday to say that "he won't go to jail."
On the evening of the same day, when police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods, and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university’s website, Lamb received a PhD in Pedagogy from Delta State University in spring 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Luck
The actor (left), in the photo with his son Redmond (right), has experienced several difficult years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime life companion Farrah Fassett, who died of cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction and was arrested for possession of drugs in 2008.
All of this, of course, played a role.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United has been out for a few months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried that he won’t be able to play on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes the show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno’s reckless 15-minute ride when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or later in the day, and then operated on.
It’s terrible – the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome great difficulties and started to play fantastically, and here it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno was fortunate that he did not receive a red card and was not assigned a penalty.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Galen believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad ride with two legs.
In a tweet, Shaw tweeted, “Thank you all for your messages, words not describing how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than I was.”
Manchester United suffers a misfortune with Luke Shaw after losing to PSV
The defender of the English will have an additional incentive to improve to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, PSV coach, said: “This is a very serious injury.”
When any player comes out with such an injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the enemy.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Galen at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now because he had no intention of hurting the enemy, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, you feel bad," Koku said.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn’t see a rodeo under Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry.
It's very hard for me, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to the hospital after colliding with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it will take a little time before you get to know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from a representative of a company that organizes children's holidays, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an environmental bias, written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: “This funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always reveals some kind of image or message that we pass through.”
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but actually tells the plot of the eponymous film shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original storyline.
"In the high-walled city of Allamnuzhville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire - to see a real tree", - we read in the text of the description of the love story, unknown
If this does not seem suspicious enough, the text of Cameron is read almost as a summary of the plot of the film "Lorax", set out on the website of the Internet Movie Database: "In the city of Odessa, surrounded by high walls, the city of Vamnuzhville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold to his money, the boy on the street.
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being, by general admission, an active parent, is so ignorant of the contents of the book, in which the unnamed boy learns about how the environment is destroyed by a greedy tree-trimmer and a knitting man is a "small man" (small man's view), Nahodkins
Probably, such an uncomplicated PR task was entrusted to an artist who had never read a book about Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text allegedly came from Cameron’s office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments followed.
For Adam Lita there was clearly a risk of not getting into England, but it is still a difficult question
Defeating Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England has chosen for this tour, it does not seem likely to repeat the defeat in the test series with a 3-0 score, which happened last time.
I would also not rule out winning on my field.
Alistair Cook’s team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players among the batters who are virtuously taking the balls, and collective thinking is strong; they won’t bring 2012 scars, but only youthful positives.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler serving twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Litt retired from England on a test cricket match and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Lee, his head coach at Yorkshire, is difficult for me to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricket players are judged by the scorers.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I’ve said it before) players choose best themselves.
The couple are half-hearted, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there'll be another chance.
England's head coach, Trevor Bailiss, was very good at his attitude, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take for the batsman to make an impression on himself is a complex question.
Lite played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best shape, but that opportunity was lost in the past.
There's Alex Hales, and he's a batsman I highly appreciate.
He’s an unpredictable cricketer that we saw at the Yorkshire club earlier this season when he made 236 in a game against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but it will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would give the opportunity to introduce an additional spinner while preserving four speed bowlers, is being considered, and I'm not against it at all.
I don’t see why a batter can’t hit the ball there, and this left-hander has already shown that he’s a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what it takes for his county of Worcestershire, but it has become the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches as a "third batsman" before coming out as an opener in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and in my short communication with him he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People might look at his approximate stats — an average of 31 with a beat and 35 with a ball — and think it’s a risky bet, but among the spinners who voted “yes” a little, and the pickers chose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a masterpiece.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring the richest experience gained in all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and relentless pace in the setup.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Colleague Durham teammate Ben Stokes is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, do not have any problems with this.
Although not everyone will agree, coaches and players selectors do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
Britain’s exit camp could win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron’s reckless policy of resuming Britain’s EU retention talks every day is experiencing more and more difficulties, even without regard to Jeremy’s election – “Is it or isn’t it?” – Corbyn the Labour leader or TUC’s resentment over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faradays.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that in the current situation in which the EU is experiencing various crises - not all of them of their own making - some participating countries are fed up with the British self-centered agenda of sowing concessions and undermining fundamental changes, despite the fact that they do not undermine the agreement.
Having gathered in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that it does not want them anyway if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it “Dave and George’s selfie program.”
The prime minister and finance minister ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the backdrop of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or not, then come home and say they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain interested in maintaining external contacts under the European Union's umbrella - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that black ministers and officials in some capitals come to an agreement when they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s most cautious chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation for her worsens as she gets worse for those in her place, Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kola (16).
French President François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon get a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It’s hard to see them crawling out of their skin to help the “Selfies” whose energy could be spent preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – which they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue intentionally useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to bolster the process of Britain’s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was a fix idea" and "Britain has received nothing valuable from the resumption of negotiations."
Europeans, unfortunately, know what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical the EU is of the media magnates, unlike the time of Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a rooted Euro-opportunist who was famous for his “EU straight bananas” by a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse company of fearful tax fraudsters, phone hackers-foreigners and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had exactly the same opinion about them, but realized that when you’re in a cage with a wild gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Millibend was more supportive of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron’s idea of a referendum, as Blair yielded to principles in favor of a repealed EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a winning bid.
The press did not forgive him.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who friendlyly slapped me on the back in Westminster on Monday — I told him he doesn’t have time anymore to spend it on me — seems to be risking repeating Neil Kinnock’s 80s “boycott of Murdoch” strategy — a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of interacting with the press — not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and the wider circle of "Little England partisans" among the Tories may probably say "yes."
It's the same thing Hillary -- "Benn, but not Bennett" -- Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boy scout refusing to admit that Corbyn's appointment of insufferable John McDonnell as "shadow" Treasurer was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought hard on TV for disloyalty to his colleagues in the Labour cabinet, not going too far and not losing his position in the cabinet.
The battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “under any circumstances,” Benn’s phrase, is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. said to parishioners and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, according to the general opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and his "boyfriend" Corbyn would like to report there - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of messaging remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlwind of social media, the hub of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to let Cameron get rid of Europe so easily, allowing him to accept Labour’s support as due during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main misconception of McDonnell and Corbyn about membership in the EU - within the "Bennite" economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, generated by slight differences, is a central principle in dogmatic spoons.
As for his misconceptions about NATO, Tom Watson is relentless in the fact that J.K. will not agitate for the exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on Britain’s concessions, when all this can be meaningless?
The United States is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government in power is cutting costs, as I was reminded Monday during a lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
A government-funded agency said that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking, according to a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet have criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its e-cigarette report.
PHE released an important report – a “turnback” last month, calling it a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
But some researchers questioned the credibility of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the “extremely shaky argument” on which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two more researchers questioned whether these claims had “solid or fragile grounds.”
Martin McKee, a professor at the European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: “The fundamental principle of health – rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
According to them, the public expects PHE's statements that "current best estimates show that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking" to be based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this comes from a single meeting of 12 people who came together to develop a multi-criteria decision-making analysis model in order to summarize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT’s health certifications in the Sustainable Development Report.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding it reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the choice of council members has not been provided, but there are several well-known e-cigarette supporters among them, some of whom have also reported funding the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants of the meeting have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco branch at PHE.
A scientific paper published by the group "pleasantly agrees" that there is a lack of "significant evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s statements that “there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are an expensive drug that causes children or non-smokers to smoke” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said BMJ’s statements had already been answered.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.”
One of the two smokers died of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the distant consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what these evidences prove and what they do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
Clearly pointing out the obvious – that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they only inflict part of the harm caused by smoking – we are fulfilling our tasks before the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that the BBC should stop the series EastEnders
Former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop releasing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would pay a lot for such successful shows as the Albert Square soap opera.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasting, which probably only a small part of the audience watches, on the high-rated peak time when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had been unsuccessfully trying to establish a partnership with the BBC for six years while working on Channel 4.
"I can't get rid of the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast broadcast broadcasts that could be shown by competing companies that are not receiving subsidies," Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of a clarification of the BBC's future fate.
If you keep the licensing fee, which I don’t think is a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should leave only those programs that aren’t released and aren’t going to be released by other companies.
The Voice show airs in the prime slot, because the creators want to get the most support possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to funding transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one example, EastEnders is another; it is widely known that they are of their own making.
Other channels would undoubtedly have given a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public broadcast.
I don’t think that would degrade the BBC in any way.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings “because of the employees’ ambitions and their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support.”
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo the comments of Sky CEO Tony Ball, who, in his 2003 McTaggart memory lecture in Edinburgh, offered the BBC to sell EastEnders-like series.
Johnson noted that more niche BBC public broadcasts "continue to go on BBC4, where it is often not possible to evaluate the audience, but the company's function is performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the Hanseatic sermons, justifying the income from the license fees, the feds in 4 million.
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds is big money, I’m curious, they think so because they don’t really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive director David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider Rita’s mission in favor of “inform, educate and entertain.”
He noted that only a small portion of the BBC's material is now formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, educate and entertain".
On the partnership issues, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as “Promenade Concerts” (only part of them, he said, are shown on TV), as well as joining alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
Sonogenetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
In the video, you can see how nematodes change the direction of movement when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have produced worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound wave pulses.
Tiny nematodes change the direction of movement when they are affected by sound impulses too high for the human ear to hear them.
The pulses act by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Next articleResearchers Control Brain Activity With Light
Scientists have said that worms demonstrate the potential of a new technique called "sonogenetics", whose essence is to use ultrasound to excite certain brain, heart and muscle cells, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Shrikanth Chalasani, a research fellow at the Salka Institute in La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation – an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The nematodes usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplified ultrasonic waves, which then penetrated the worm body.
Amplified ultrasonic waves affect structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to worms, so their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to influence modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worm organisms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light pulses.
Claasani argues that compared to this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the right area of the brain by fiber optic, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through the body tissues, so they do not need to pass inside the skull box for delivery.
"We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal," said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment is right on your doorstep!
Advertising ads harassing the British arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International video protesting the arms exhibition.
Amazing killer drones!
Destroying iron candles!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-noise spikes that cause unbearable pain, but leave no traces!
The cheerful voice and the cartooned animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition is an ugly parody prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the intention of the British government to "push" the weapons to the repressive regimes, taking advantage of the incoming center.
DSEI arms exhibition: authoritarian regimes are going to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and in subway trains that require you to look at them again.
"An important announcement going on the DLR line from September 15 to 18?" - written on one of them by the fonts of the London Underground with the image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of the tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will warm up to the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters are painted by artists who exhibited their works at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy’s Disneyland Park.
A team called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them around London, using a “advertising spot hacker set,” a 6-pound key set that is said to “give access to about a third of the advertising space at the bus stops of the planet.”
Transporters in London are not happy with this "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of Cruel Designs and a professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and aspiring to bring political art to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists start working with protest movement activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms show, welcoming passengers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the pro bono VCCP agency, with the involvement of a graphic designer and voice artist who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the arms show – with a pass in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s run them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought to create more realistic and cunning corporate advertising, but "filling her home with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more exciting activity."
“They have incredibly helped us to draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” said Amnesty’s Tom Davis.
We now need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the topic of the arms exhibition comes from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed information about the order for the "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" received from the U.S. Army.
It includes “an unmatched cumulative ammunition that brings unsurpassed reserve action inside the target.”
Whatever he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules of residence in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved into a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I irritated – and the numerous, long-lasting complaints to others.
Basically, what I’ve learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can range from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely scary.
He encourages people to talk about where you came from, whether you took academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you're "honestly, neither love nor hate Marmite" because, seriously, it's just a yeast extract of yourself.
Breathe.
And help others to pause too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn’t even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were giving out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas, and social gathering places, but they’re also a place where people dress and fix underwear.
Also on the topic: Don’t even think about starting a university study while in a relationship
Introverts at universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a haven, but many hostels shape a culture of swinging from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendships.
It can be hell for someone who is trying to regain their strength.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave and I have been able to restore the energy I spent communicating with you.”
Try to feel when a classmate is tired of communicating - and not beating him, but sending an SMS.
By the way, about the thing: do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He's seen something.
Make friends with baking.
Since you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the show Bake-Off, knocking on the door to people to introduce and present a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange action, does not so remind you of the 1950s with their "Welcome to me, we are neighbors, I am something to you
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will probably associate with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Poorly-blind lumps of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you hit them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, taking someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing - taking a little milk for tea?
Take care of the milk owner.
Probably he will offer you not to be ashamed, even if it boils inside with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat this as an adult than my neighbor who poured in her milk dishwashing liquid to retaliate against those who took it without demand.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or studying.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor to improve the sound of drums and bass guitars as it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours, then turned off her music and locked the door behind her, going for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it have been romantic if your future husband had settled in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extreme, before you bite your elbows, clumsy, if you accepted a neighbor as your future husband, became attracted to him, broke a relationship, and should see him every day, and perhaps watch him drag all of your common friends on his side?
Of course, you can't tell the heart - but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own dust a little.
At the exciting moment when you realize someone has left the keys inside their locked room, the line between joke and harassment is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never stain someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the other person’s door and drop the keys into a glass of water, which you’ll then put in the freezer – but don’t glue other people’s things to the ceiling with Blu-Tack more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on iPhone after the release of an update from Apple
You can request a new operating system by going to Settings, selecting General, and then selecting Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after the installation when an error message appears telling them that "App update failed".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revival subsides or try to update via iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include removing apps to increase free space — but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the upgrade, and also simplified execution with a special utility that offers to remove apps and reinstall them after the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that when performing the update, your phone is charged or located near the charger to prevent the battery from discharging.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as unloading the phone in the process may lead to an update failure.

Washington responded to Russia’s military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
According to him, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to an exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that the continued support of President Assad from Russia creates a risk of exacerbation and prolongation of the conflict, and also negatively affects our common goal - the fight against extremism - if we also do not continue to focus on the search for solutions to the Syrian conflict.
They also noted that Kerry once again underlined the US commitment to the fight against the "Islamic State" as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be a member of it.
In addition, the United States "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in attempts to oppose the Islamic State."
On Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Ernest said that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet arrived: "When the president decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will go to the benefit of our interests, then he will raise the phone."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia’s decision to increase support for the Assad regime a “losing bet”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
“But he didn’t listen to my warnings — and as a result, the situation got worse,” he said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free importation were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
About this "Izvestia" told the assistant minister of economic development Elena Lashkin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, on the results of a trip to Crimea, commissioned a number of departments - Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Transparency of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Health, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for the creation of well-being zones.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their vessels abroad – about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million annually go to the treasury of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes", providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties and customs duties.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - said Lashkin.
The matter was referred to the Subcommittee on Customs and Tariff, Non-tariff Regulation, Protective Measures in Foreign Trade of the Governmental Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also approved by the agencies following the discussion.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure of full conditional exemption at import is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU, Lashkin explained.
In the list of imported goods, which are completely exempted from the payment of customs duties, taxes, imported goods, imported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, imported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exported goods, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports, exports
In the press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestia" told that they prepared mandatory decrees on the sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Yevpatoria, which provide a simplified procedure for the entry and exit of ships of small size, sports sails and
The Ministry of Transport has instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the application of the simplified procedure of entry of small-sized, sports sailing and recreational vessels into the seaport and the exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft orders of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the borders of the water area of the sea ports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the stage of harmonisation, - said the press service of the department.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should carry out state surveillance, classification and inspection, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, it’s a whole ever-evolving industry that involves a large number of people.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is of little interest, the only place where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area, the rules of the border service are extremely strict: in order to go for a walk on a yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
Inside Russia, the yacht even has nowhere to refuel.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then there is a problem where to take it," says Nordmarine's sales director Denis Novikov.
As for yacht storage space, there are now special hangars in Moscow and St. Petersburg for yachts up to 30 m. Yachts are also sent for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers of yachts are rich people, but with the beginning of the crisis, the demand for yachts decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a $500 million loan.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the statement said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Cimiao Fan, said that reforms in the banking sector will help to revive credit in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and in the World Bank are observing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan is calling on the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the granting of a loan of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
In prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
The Public Council of the Federal Service for the Enforcement of Sentences (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestites in the colonies.
About this "Izvestia" told the member of the council Vladislav Hryb.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia, not determined by gender, in domestic prisons it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transgender people.
However, Vladislav Hryb emphasizes that it is possible to determine the sentences of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicts have undergone appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Hryb believes that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice has been successfully implemented abroad: in the SIZO (where the accused are up to a court decision) there are separate chambers for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special units.
Today, it is the only way to deal with such criminals.
They definitely need to be isolated, because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in conventional cameras is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.
The humiliation of the trance by the roommates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big a city, how many criminals with an unspecified sex, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
Separate S.I.O.O.s are not needed - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As explained by Pilz, the unit can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, then prisoners of transsexuals will be able to enter the prison from any region.
Citizens are detained at the scene of the crime, so the receipt of transvestites or transgender from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - believes Pilz.
Recall, on the eve of law enforcement officials were unable to decide in which investigative detention center - male or female - to identify the detained for the possession of drugs 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozukov (known under the name Alina Davis), because of which the man with the girl's appearance was unconscious.
He was released home under a non-departure license.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, as the mechanism for the content of transgender people in SIZO and colonies in Russia is not really yet.
The Russian human rights defender, activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolay Alexeyev supported the idea of creating special places for the execution of punishment by transgender people, noting that their own desires abroad are also possible to define people in the colony or husbands.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexeyev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender ones.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that in Russia there will be many citizens willing to pretend to be transsexuals in order to get into a colony other than the usual.
Of course, it is possible to introduce a medical examination before placing people in a transgender colony, but not always everything is unambiguous.
For example, in the United States, one of the inmates, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, and already in prison he said that he wants to change gender, - said Alexeyev.
A person can feel like anyone else.
But as long as there are no separate places to punish transgender people, I doubt that prison officials will seriously think about the safety of such people and understand the subtleties of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender offenders in the colony can greatly delay the commencement of the sentence by convicts.
A commission is created - it is a question of sexology, psychiatrists carry out long observations, this is not a test on the basis of which a highly accurate conclusion is made.
Today’s psychiatric system allows this.
Therefore, before the sex change, potential patients are always subjected to such examinations – they show exactly whether the sex change with surgery is the necessary measure, Lordkipanidze says.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, because it takes an average of a month for such a survey.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but taking into account that homosexuals in Russia about 5%, we can say that transgender people are even fewer, and those who have such a deviation and even commit crimes, a very small number, - Lordkipanidze said.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgenders and so can receive separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior world chess championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk finished the world chess championship among juniors up to 20 years.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to push the Pole Yan-Khishtof Dudu, who apparently confidently went to the title.
The victory of the girls was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa.
The World Chess Championship, which took place since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already in the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to lose almost all the intrigue, as the representative of Poland Jan-Kshishtof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions are held according to the Swiss system).
Given that Duda was the ranking favorite of the championship, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he will miss the gap was very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the lag to just 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, in order to catch the leader, had to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help if Duda won your party.
Plus, this compulsory win, of course, could have affected the game of the Russian chess player and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda, who had met with Benjamin Bock, to finish his game.
Fortunately for Antipova, the Polish chess player reduced the confrontation with the Dutchman to nothing.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional scores.
And that is why it is to him that the leadership of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous District, whose governor Natalya Komarova, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the main prize.
But in the competition of girls intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Bukse (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she did with success.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to reach Buksa.
The Russian athlete remained second with a lag from the champion in 0.5 points.
It is changing the regional structure.
The company combines the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
According to Vimpelcom CEO Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are being carried out to "remain a strong player in the market", to develop the company "in new, not always favorable external conditions".
In an interview with Russia 24, Mr. Slobodin clarified that they intend to reduce in Russia "tens of percent" of personnel.
Rospotrebnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King restaurants and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsk highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the restaurant on Bolshoy Tulskaya Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after eliminating all violations.
43 restaurants violated the requirements for the equipment of the premises.

Ministry of Commerce: targeted food aid will not be the analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of targeted food assistance will not be an analogue of the card system of distribution of food that existed in the USSR.
It is about modern targeted food assistance to the population and support of an effective domestic producer of goods.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase "food card".
It should be noted in particular that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the echo of the past times of total deficit, the card distribution system in which the number of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," Mr. Yevtukhov said.
Earlier, "U" wrote that the program for introducing food cards for the poor has been brought to the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top-level managers, the study summarizes the results of the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year’s rating.
Last year’s winners are invited to confirm their participation as candidates for this year’s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is proposed to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be advisable to add to the total pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following executives of the functional areas of the company: Financial Director, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Personnel Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each manager proposed by experts is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate their management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates on the basis of the industry principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and wood processing industry, engineering, media business, metallurgy, multi-disciplinary holdings, professional services, communication and telecommunication.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to access the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can submit their assessments according to the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The methodology for building a rating is based on the principle "The best choose the best": top managers rate top managers, functional managers rate functional managers.
Such a principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of expert commissions.
All desired candidates of the rating of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of previous years are invited to the regular meetings of the expert commissions.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: the Commission on Approval of the List of Chief Executives and eight Commissions on Approval of Chief Executives.
At the meetings of the expert committees, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the Internet rating and are closed information before the publication of the rating) or to make up-to-date adjustments according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "U".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfort rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the small and medium-sized business lending market in January-April this year fell by 40%.
What do you think is the situation today?
After the panic at the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015, the amount of loans to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Lending under 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the bank could put in an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from late payments to non-returns, then now it is impossible to do so: the rates are already cloudy.
For business, the current rate of interest on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their return on investment.
A rate of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
To what extent do you think the demand for loans is being met?
After the ECB’s interest rate decline, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenues.
Today, business has one option: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to control the movement of funds.
At the same time, with the availability of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies that allow to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All this, in the end, allows the company to make the products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What major trends in the SME lending market will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for a reduction in the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of a reduction in the key rate.
However, a radical fall in the price of loans for SMEs is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate to get real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the rates of the Central Bank are lowered.
If we talk about the level of overdue, then traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited in both the ability to replenish funds and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the country’s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese characters.
Beautiful, laconic and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new crossover CX-5, as, by the way, and any other model of the brand: without exaggeration attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
The Japanese already simply because of its "Japaneseness" is able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete excitement.
It is possible to give arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and a person even in principle will agree with these arguments, but the whole conversation will be scattered by the final phrase: "But it's a Japanese car!
There is nothing to argue about!
Such people probably should love not only the technology, but also everything else Japanese.
Citing Base, spicing wasabi food, collecting katana and dressing your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but according to the canons of Japanese street fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only one that girls wear with pleasure after graduating from school.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict at the same time.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But much more changes the appearance of the car the new drawing of headlights and rear lights, by which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensual, but the appearance has a touch of rigor.
You don't have to call the police.
Driving the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience the stoic Japanese tranquility.
The 2.2-litre diesel engine provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp - only 5.9 l. The power unit is equipped exclusively with automatic transmission and full drive.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you do not end up at the scene of your own accident behind the wheel of the CX-5.
To further enhance comfort, while maintaining excellent handling, the suspensions have redesigned the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the sleeves of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds has been reduced by 13%.
A swimsuit in a flower or stripe is just as boring as a budget sedan.
It's a different thing if a girl peels in a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing combat.
It will get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal space reserve for both wide shoulders and long legs - who owns what.
More long-legged will surely appreciate the fact that the stiffness in the front of the central tunnel is now soft and does not beat on the ankles in swirls.
The widest range of Mazda active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
In order to identify a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used.
There is also adaptive lighting, and strip-down warning, and dead zone monitoring, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.
Comfortable, with a minimum of protrusions, it accommodates a load of 561 l. The rear seats are folded in a ratio of 4:2:4 - each section is equipped with a separate removable lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 l.
The costume of the cartoon hero in Japan is called "kigurumi".
The kigurumi-pyjama looks particularly daunting.
It can do anything!
Sleep, of course.
But also to entertain small children.
Or just walking around with such an animal on the street...
After all, it is so great when there is an opportunity to choose - funny clothes, behavioral manner or car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the Kawaicat store material.
Kyiv has broken the nuclear union.
Kiev formally issued a refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday with the second attempt still voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements for the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine passed a law dissolving the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth blocks at the Khmelnytsky Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill was passed by the government only after the second vote, the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then when the bill was revoked, 234 members of parliament voted for it.
The Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant established under the USSR on the original project was to have four power units of 1 GW with reactors of the type VWER, but only two were able to build.
Negotiations with Moscow on completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
As there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the building of the blocks would have to be credited to the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in the relations between the two countries, Kyiv began to close relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant and on the construction project of a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship remained was the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for the current Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the production of electricity in the country), since so far the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoatom" replace the Russian supplies with nothing.
The plans for the completion of the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not been definitively abandoned: in 2014, negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev.
The UN Secretary-General opposes the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
“There is no military solution,” the AP quoted him as answering a question about Russia’s military support for Syria.
Ban also said he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the heads of foreign affairs of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
“The meeting will be on Syria,” he said.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolay Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating a base in Syria in the future.
There are no such plans yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, the U.S. reported that it does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to the official Damascus is necessary to fight the Russian-banned Islamic State terrorist group.
For more details on US doubts about Russian aid to Syria, see the article “The Russian military presence in Syria worries Washington.”
The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in south-eastern Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "to return to the normal life of our countries."
Asked whether, in his opinion, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the "Norman format" or in the format of a contact group on the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, the former president of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions on the tripartite negotiations, but the tonality of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod summarized the results of the elections to the city duma for the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy seats played on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections were made by representatives of the CPRF, who accused the election of "covering up falsifications".
The opposition's comments were not accepted.
At the same time, he rejected the Communists of Russia party in organizing a referendum on the abolition of the fee for the overhaul of apartment buildings.
The city council officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Nizhny Novgorod on the municipal electoral district.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the lists of voters in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued for voting in the branch commissions, and 268.000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,7 thousand bulletins were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia", six deputy seats in pride are given to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given to party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of "Fair Russia" are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the city duma: in the event of a dismissal of the mandate, he passes to the next candidate on the list of candidates.
The Chairman of the Gorizbyrcom Alexander Makeev informed the members of the commission that he is introducing duty stations for "dispatching telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" on the subject of the resignation of the mandates.
When approving the protocol on the election results, the representatives of the CPRF reported multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the committee with the right of advisory vote from the KPRF, proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that on the order of the head of the administration of the Sormov district, the entrance to the building of the administration was closed.
For a long time, neither the deputies of the State Udma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, could pass inside, and the resonant scandal with an assault on the doors of the rayad administration was shown on television.
All observers and members of the commissions with the right to a consultative vote had the opportunity to attend the meetings of the district commissions.
Their head only stopped access when the vote was over and the district commissions had not yet come to submit their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and at all the meetings interested parties could be present", - said the member of the election committee Natalia Andryushina.
The Communists objected that in the blocked building of the administration for more than four hours illegally detained deputy Zak of the assembly of the region Lyudmila Aristova, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that in a number of UICs on election day they started sealing the urns at 6-7 a.m., putting out ballots for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the committees with the right of advisory vote and observers were not notified, so they arrived at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations, they could uncontrollably throw ballots into the urns.
However, the mountain picker, who has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the throwing of unreported ballots.
The members of the commission and their colleague from "Fair Russia" Maria Popova did not support the proposal to come out with amendments to regional legislation to clearly establish the time of opening envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the polls.
"In the order of your own initiative, contact the CEC," - advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, KPRF member Sergey Samokhin collapsed on the chairman with loud accusations, shouting that the election ignores dozens of complaints and covers up the falsifications in the elections.
"You are not here at the rally, be careful to declare!" - the chairman of the election committee was offended.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By September 27, the electorate must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the city duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city’s electoral commission refused the political party “Communists of Russia” to register an initiative group for a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to raise two questions for the discussion of the Nizhny Novgorod people: do they agree that the fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings should be "immediately canceled" and the tariffs on housing and utilities "freeze until 2020".
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova explained that the treatment of the "Communists of Russia" is contrary to the legislation.
FedEx revenues are mixed, with 2016 forecasts declining.
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced its annual profit forecast due to a drop in demand for freight services and an increase in costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell by about 2.5 percent on preliminary bids 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast is down despite an average rate hike of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on January 4, and a rise in charges for ground transportation of heavy or bulk cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to grow revenue compared to last year due to spending cuts, increased gross income, and increased online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company “has worked steadily, taking into account weak economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
Workforce hiring plans for the holidays were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly as many as they hired last year.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, a 6 percent increase from a year earlier.
Revenue per share amounted to $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share, according to a survey of 12 analysts conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Income increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the urgent international shipping sector, leading to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express shipping division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from land transportation increased by 29%, but operating income remained largely unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express transportation unit received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell due to higher labor costs.
In preliminary bids, FedEx stocks fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15 an hour before the exchange opened.
They closed on Tuesday, falling 11 percent year-on-year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in several years, Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table in a Honduras red tree, deciding whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated meeting room, a wall image of the United States will be hung on two floors above them.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country’s economic interests ahead of everyone else.
The central bank has received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have acknowledged that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third commission may prove to be an unknown factor in an almost predictable decision to be announced Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data shows confident economic growth, recent shocks in global financial markets can keep already cautious Federal system executives from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were to look for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the world market would be enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate hike this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the federal system to hold back, with the key indicator showing only a roughly 30 percent chance of a rapid rise.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the federal system raises the stakes, provided that decision makers do not mitigate the blow by promising that the next raise will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The upswing was provoked by expectations that those who determine the Federal system’s strategy will leave the stakes this week,” said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research.
“It will be a surprise if the Federal system raises rates at this point in time,” he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve does so, “they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts objected that the rate increase could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seemed to be inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in the slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although new jobs slowed in August, labour market growth was steady this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost at the level that is considered full-time in the federal system.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the Federal System’s leadership said the key cause was the temporary effect of the sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy “can handle higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market,” noted Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones average index for industrial stocks fell by as much as 16 percent in May, a record high as investors feared a slowdown in China’s economy could slow global growth.
The market has partially recovered its position this month, and the Dow Jones Index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve, the market upset further complicates the difficult calculations of the term of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of information about what has happened in the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have started to twist the nuts at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
“There is a great deal of uncertainty about what the consequences for the U.S. economy may be, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a central concern of the federal system, and should not be technically taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become a global financial power.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint from then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “stifle” its monetary expansion has caused shocks in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the heads of the Federal Reserve would not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more of an art than a science,” said Zachary Carabelle, CEO of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve, there have been cases of overreaction to financial market movements that do not appear to be related to economic principles.”
Laker, a member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising rates, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three sessions, “despite the limited identifiable implications for growth in the United States,” Laker said.
A year later, the heads of the federal system canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should put stability first only in times of major crises, such as market crashes in 2008,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Interest Rate Committee at the Bank of England.
The last panic was not even close to that level, he said.
“You certainly wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re frightened by the rate hikes because the markets are experiencing a shock,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute of World Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should be ahead of the curve.

State Duma spokesman Sergei Naryshkin admits that the US is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East, so that the waves of refugees flow into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulan-Bator as part of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a proponent of conspiracy theories, but the question arises: Is it not Europe the ultimate target of those who, with such manic persistence, have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?” he asked.
"Someone must have assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death, would be headed for safe EU countries," he added.
Naryshkin asked: “Have many political leaders of Europe spoken out frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally crushing their countries?”
“No, the old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
"Unfortunately, Europe has long and unbiasedly looked and is looking at how the military sword, sewn according to NATO standards, is also shattered by moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law," he said.
Government troops and paramilitary groups loyal to them are opposed by rebels consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the terrorist group "Islamic State" banned in Russia joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The US supports the rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The president of Syria called the reason for the West’s dislike of Russia.
The West’s claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put in his place another who will act in the interests of the Western countries, not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to a sharp reversal of the Western media with the start of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West.”
Putin urged the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West’s constant statements that Assad himself should step down, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he does, at the request of the people, not by a decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
“If the people want him to stay, the president remains, or else he should leave immediately,” he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation with them is being carried out.
Syria is also fighting terrorism along with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that the country supports the Syrian state in politics, economics and military spheres.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he said.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the United States," Assad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000 people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was captured by the terrorist group "Islamic State", banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States is carrying out air strikes on ISIS positions.
In Utah, 12 people died from flooding.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people died as a result of flooding.
Another one is believed to be missing, reports Fox 13 Salt Lake City.

There are also reports of three children who were rescued.
650 teams were involved in the search and rescue work.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: World: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to State Department spokesman John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools for "further isolation of Russia" if it will support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, reports RIA Novosti.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov during the conversation with Kerry once again emphasized the need to create a single front to fight terrorist groups operating on the territory of this country.
We also discussed ways of resolving the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Russia was building up its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern over Moscow’s strengthening support for Assad.
Washington has said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the spokesman of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are in favor of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was captured by the terrorist organization "Islamic State".
The international coalition led by the United States is exposing ISIS positions to air strikes.
Borodai called the information of the American newspaper defamation of Strelkov.
Former Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Boroday denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent "Lenty.ru".
The Washington Post’s note is wonderful in that everything is purely twisted there.
The former Minister of Defense of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one tied up and "goed out" of the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very uplifted mood, without ropes, without three furs of money, which are attributed to him by different characters", - he noted.
According to Borodia, the talk about Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper really went.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," the former head of the government of the DPRK said.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write about the fact that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia "linked".
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then it is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I emphasized that Strelkov left alone," Boroday noted.
"This is a slander to me and to Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post appeared an article, in which the words of Borodai about the fact that he exported Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a coercive order.
According to the publication, Boroday noted that he was forced to tie his partner.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish loggers began to cut down trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the credibility of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
Weapons and valuable minerals can be found inside the train.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a train with gold was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to block the search area.
Three days before that, Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland Petr Zhukhovsky said that local treasurers with a "99 percent probability" found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is mentioned in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm approached the authorities of the Polish city of Valbzhik with a message that they found a train in a walled tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21.
The chief narcologist of Russia proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that before this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - acts particularly harmful".
So he said in a live broadcast of the radio station "Speaking Moscow", commenting on the information that the speaker of Sovfeda Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
People are growing unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
Mentally he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
“It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, finally matures only by the age of 21,” said Brun.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and head of the project "Nutritional Russia" Sultan Hamzaev told "Izvestia" that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age census in the sale of alcohol and "agreed together with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again at the top floor of the parliament".
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the law on information protection of children
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor’s office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development”, a statement was made on September 16 by the correspondent of Sib.fm.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society at the Chitai City store on the Red Prospect.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violate the FZ "On protecting children from information that harms their health and development".
On September 16, the statement was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor's office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the appeal of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban a book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Syb.fm.
Moreover, this is a very serious problem that will affect society.
It will begin to re-read the Bible, which it had not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grande promotes healthy diets for breastfeeding mothers
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has invented a scandalous method to convince women of the need for complete nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves demonstrating images of breastfeeding babies painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy requirements, pregnant and pregnant women are recommended to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, recent research suggests that one calorie increase is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy eating in pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child’s immune system has been identified.
A train crashed a school bus near Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on a railroad track.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing she could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, there was a collision in front of their eyes.
The video was taken by one of the schoolchildren.
Due to the emergency situation, there was panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and flee along the sidewalk.
The route is still blocked.
According to police, no one was miraculously injured, except one passenger of the train, who was lightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the category of weight up to 57.15 kg, passed on Friday, ended with the victory of Magalie knockout in the 12th round.
Brown went to the hospital with a brain injury to the skull.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support device.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in loss.
He has two children left.
This is the second death toll among Australian boxers in six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Bradon Smith died from injuries sustained on the ring.
Now the AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but it is better, from its point of view, to ban it at all.
I understand that this is unintentionally happening,” said Stephen Pernis, vice president of the organization.
But in the way that boxing now exists, there will always be situations where an athlete gets a bleeding or brain injury that leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional organization that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergey Naryshkin urged the OSCE to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Russian State Duma spokesman Sergey Naryshkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He said this at the OSCE PA session in Ulan Bator.
We regard this as unacceptable, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignorance of the principles of open international dialogue,” he said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get back to politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let’s restore humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
“The duality never ended well,” he said.
Speaking from the stand of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an interparliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call upon the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
"First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and to immediately convene our inter-parliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"This is almost the only common site where there are still discussions on how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician said.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulan Bator and will last until September 18.
I enjoyed winning for a couple of days.
World Athletics Champion Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed to beat the European team championship in the 110 meters with barriers, set several records, and most importantly - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the "Diamond League", taking the overall third place.
"New News" asked Shubenkov to share impressions from the upcoming season.
Sergei, the season isn't over for you yet?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World War Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will think about rest.
It is true that I will now prepare at home, in Barnaul, and to be at home is a completely different condition.
It’s easier than walking around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
Passions after the main start of the season boiled down, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressurized.
You can compete in pleasure, in "relaxation".
And you know the holidays are coming soon...
Is there fatigue?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Tiredness at the end of the season always builds up.
It doesn’t matter what you do, whether you win or lose.
Every competition is a stressful one.
Constant flights, transfers - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
What's that? I'm just happy!
By the time you finished at the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
Occasionally.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget that.
But in general, I think that the bad athlete who lives the old victories, rolls his successful runs over and over again.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we have to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can’t say there was something so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the congregation, then at home again.
It's just as usual.
But with the coach set a goal: to try to get to a new level that I have never been to before.
Almost all winter time was spent laying the foundation.
We ran a bunch of crossbows, did all-physical training exercises, which included both traction and seating, and we pumped our backs.
Then they took up barrier training, a lot of engaged in technology.
How are the competitors being watched?
I always try to do it, the good in the age of the Internet there is no problem with it.
I watched the Winter European Championships, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was occupied by the French!
I thought: we need to do something, dilute this company.
With every start this season you added and added in the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I’ve had all the last few seasons on the same schedule.
There's no way I'm running 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always unfold my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to escape from 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that you kind of feel that you are ready for feats, and in competitions to show your willingness does not always work.
What happened at the London Olympics, for example?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not go back to the final. - "NI") tried to forget immediately.
It was really good and could have gone 13 seconds.
Even if he had repeated his best score at that point, he would have become the bronze winner of the Games.
But it wasn't lucky.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What's the matter?
It was in Tag.
I really wanted to get into the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And he fell down straight from the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that to rip and carry a broken head means not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Championship in Moscow, he has already reached the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the "gold" at the time!
How do you manage to develop a decent speed, not to lose even the head, not to turn off?
But that's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique, so as not to break down the barriers.
I noticed that when you adjust not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the best part is when you have the feeling that you are running and everything works out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depths after the first serious successes are striving to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
It's better at home anyway.
I have no idea where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be better to have better conditions, but I try to be satisfied with what I have.
Q. Have you been together for a long time?
From the age of 12, since he came to athletics.
More specifically, I trained first with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
Children's multiplayer was - it's when they throw the ball, jump in the length from place...
At 14, I tried to run with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race it was possible to comply with the norms of the second adult category.
That's the way it is.
Has there ever been fear of barriers?
I was able to make a deal with them right away.
There has always been a lot of work on technology.
How much he has been tormented over a single rush!
But you can't go anywhere from this routine.
The technique has to be constantly refined - so that at night I could wake up, I immediately got up and would run through the barriers.
Everyone who has seen your run in Beijing says it was a very beautiful run.
Oh, thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't review my runs, and I couldn't hold back.
But you need to work on efficiency - there are no limits to perfection.
Do you not now fear that the victory of the year before the Olympics will be a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
Once you have chosen this road, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you’re not weak, you shouldn’t feel any extra burden.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I’m not naive enough to be surprised by the reaction to an interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, don't feed them with bread - come on, throw the enemy.
And although I didn't roll the flag, and the same thing, I said a million times here, and didn't directly call anyone a bastard, something else hit me.
All my pseudo-friends blinked, disappeared somewhere in a second.
The pressure I'm subjected to is so strong that even I, the publisher of the kind of boys, think white people have embraced.
It's like you're walking, walking, and you're being attacked by a mob and you're being muzzled with rods.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm going to hit a hawk, I'm old, guys, scared.
The other thing is no support.
I had no illusions, and now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so eat it.
And to give passports to bastards like Fred Derst or Monson, only fools can.
I'd rather be a better journalist than a shameless job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called an annexation.
So I believe that the reference to the way the drunken Khrushchev tried to sign something does not fit in any way into the general picture of the human dormitory.
It's like getting to a neighbor and picking up his living space...
The war has gone out of the Kremlin, and it will only end there.
I’m almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it started with the call of some bastard from the Kremlin.
I'm guessing who that might have been...
Cobzon doesn't have much to live for.
I don’t understand, he’s the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin’s hands.
Is he losing his apartment?
Well, they took down his monument.
Of course, people remember him as insulting his little homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven leads in the ranking despite Ninth's attempts to shed light on the loss of the leaders in the Today Show
The departure of Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to shed light on the consequences of the Liberal Party’s statement on the release of the leader’s seat could not significantly raise the Today rating.
In the morning the show of the Ninth was broadcast from the state capital after the defeat by Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Competitor - Sunrise - with lead singers David Koch and Samantha Armitage, stranded in London as part of a week-long international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance torture did not seem to matter much to Australian viewers, although the Sunrise audience had 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to the Today audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly higher compared to its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared to 330,000 for Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers compared to 314,000 for Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!

An important news for Seven was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the former star of the series Packed to the Rafters Eric Thompson.
A new drama about the family’s recently widowed father, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, has gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics have argued whether Thompson can handle the popular show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Yesterday's answer was a loud yes.
The X Factor Seven remained in strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million, easily surpassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For Seventh mixed luck and failure in the second evening Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television quiz hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, gathered 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half-hour - overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat has collected 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia ratings on the second evening will force Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is the replacement for the Million Dollar Minute, which was unable to outperform the show Mac Gwyer.

The three finalists are unanimous that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellowes, Sarah McKay and Snezhana Marcoski may have accidentally made it clear who will win the HoloStyle.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually be staying in "Holostyak" is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the final, of course, remain silent about who exactly received his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McCabe, Snowy Marcos and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls will be left behind, they may have inadvertently given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until the final, which will take place on Thursday.
All three women come in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, and joy of life as the reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not for you, then who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could involuntarily indicate which of them really conquered the heart of the "Holostyaka".
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoski undoubtedly called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from day one.
“From the moment I became a participant, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam, and I understood that they fit very well with each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it,” she said.
"Sarah is a very open person, easy and fun with her," added Marcoski.
I've seen them together, there's really an attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay believes that she and Sam Wood will be a great couple.
McKay herself said that thanks to her house appointments last week, she realized that Wood might be “the same person.”
“As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized it wasn’t just a game – I believed him with all my heart.”
When asked who to choose, if it is not her, she responded mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls the same, and Snow and Lana are equally worthy of it.
The show The Bachelor comes out on Wednesdays at 7.30pm on Channel Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several options to start his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the U.S. - as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Thomswell and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the reserve bench for the remainder of the game for the loss of the ball that the former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return of the pant in a win against Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to return the pants, and also involved him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of arranging the distribution to the newcomers in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received support from special team coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on the return of the pant by the Minnesota Vikings team during the first quarter
At the beginning of his debut in the NHL, Hayne and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not expect.
He was seen arguing as he left the field after losing the ball, and later told the host of the show Hamish and Andy on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start to his career in the NFL.
“It happens, you’re just thinking about the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his failure to his debut in the 2007 Origin game series, when throwing the ball in his counting zone brought Queensland a try.
In the end, this experience turned out to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the photo on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin Meet to Discuss Gay Rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of using weapons at a Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were suppressed.
There have been clashes between migrants and police on the Hungarian border.
The refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian town of Reske, which grew into clashes with law enforcement officers.
As a result, Hungarian police used cannons and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants are throwing police stones and trying to demolish the fence installed at the border.
In response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to break the border, the police have sent reinforcements to the place of the clashes.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities of the country allowed the migrants to arrive in Croatian territory and ensure their transport from there to the necessary country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, Hungary’s parliament tightened its legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for the consideration of asylum applications.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
Also, the Hungarian parliament intends to consider the question of the transfer of the functions of the Hungarian armed forces for the protection of the border parliament of the country in the near future.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175 km long barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to deter the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian confessed to committing the largest cyberattack in U.S. history.
Vladimir Drinkman, accused of the largest cyberattack in U.S. history, has confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers.
During the trial in the federal court of the state of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to a conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about the conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $ 300 million.
“Residents like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security,” U.S. Attorney General Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
When rendering the sentence, the court will take into account the confessions of the Russian and may reduce his term.
Drinkman's verdict will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes committed against him.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk of Russia supporting the regime of Bashar Assad.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar Assad is exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria with the help of an effective political transition from power,” he said.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to combat the Islamic State group (the activity of which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the secretary of state, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the phone call, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
The White House threatened Russia with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
The day before, White House spokesman Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest offered to join an international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media has often reported on the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping Syrians master the technique to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began shooting rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's proposed new constitution, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, caused such a high mortality rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of fierce protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where representatives of the Madhesi people say the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among Tara nationals who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, it was a decisive step on the way to a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted for the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a company for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk headed the new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent "Regional".
Oleg Valerievich, where did you start working as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of the audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit examination of the expenditure of the local budget.
Thereafter, a municipal property audit was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the turnover of documents to five days.
Previously, the papers could go on for months.
Measures have been developed to increase the income base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a visiting meeting of the government was held in Sayansk, where the issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
There was no project estimate documentation (PDD) for any object in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of PSD on the road, kindergarten, northern sewer collector and water supply.
Work on the two roads is already underway.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such a positive demographic in the city has not been observed in the last 27 years.
So the issue of securing places in kindergartens is one of the most relevant today.
As of September 1, the kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats, has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds before.
Last year, after the renovation, the kindergarten No. 23 opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
The repair was done on the terms of co-financing from regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the program "People's Initiatives" helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the rank of children between the ages of one and a half and three years.
We have no queues for children between the ages of three and seven.
Is the investor interested in the area?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, first of all, sayan enterprises, they need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningradsky district is put into operation.
As far as construction is concerned, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya that has entered the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All the necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand sq. m of housing for those wishing to participate in the program.
One of the conditions - housing should not be more expensive than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes the finish "turnkey".
If we manage the specified volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan Pork Complex was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for an invaluable price.
We're working with the prosecution to protest this deal.
The land under the object is federally owned.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transfer of 88 hectares to regional property is resolved, with subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great support for the city.
Is the Institute of Social Partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded about 140 socio-economic partnership agreements.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Sensitive support is provided by such enterprises as ZAO "Vostok-Center", Novo-Ziminskaya TEC, OOO "Sayansky Broiler", OOO "PK MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Directly to the Day of the City LLC "Sayansky Broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Center" carried out repairs of the horse courtyard, where specialists deal with children's ipatherapy, costing more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city ZAGS.
Sponsors helped to celebrate City Day colorfully.
As in the good old days, there was a parade with the participation of city collectives and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Saiyan poets, was published.
Initial builders and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sayansk have been awarded anniversary medals.
The patrons are also involved in the work of the city charity fund.
The first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
Over nine months, more than 800,000 rubles have been allocated to support talented boys, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and educators in the city.
The provision of housing to specialists is of great importance for addressing the human resources issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers received office housing.
We have a housing allocation program with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plan is to redesign the building, in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the program "Hosting for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for employees of the budget sphere.
The most important thing is that there is a workable team in the city with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential in Sajansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on indexation of subsidies taking into account the increase in prices.
The State Duma has introduced a bill that provides for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the rise in prices.
The author of the document - a deputy from "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to conduct additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of increase in prices for goods and services.
The indexation of pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum of the pensioner in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The bill introduced in the lower house provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the rate of growth of consumer prices.
In this case, the first indexing is postponed to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini about the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, OSCE PA Speaker Ilkka Kanerva said that sanctions against lawmakers participating in the activities of the Assembly were inadmissible.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Bator Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus and Greece, were gathered in support of the position of Canerva.
"Already formed a strong enough support," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA spoke with the intention of collecting the signatures of deputies, which indicated the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise this issue to the level of the EU’s governing bodies and “send a corresponding petition”.
The NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape Islands is 60 percent
A broad front of the low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another clearly delineated low-pressure area roughly in the middle between the Green Cape Islands and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, according to synoptics from Miami.
Google launches a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced the start of a double donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping overcrowded European countries refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has taken an uncharacteristic personal approach by announcing a donation fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement from one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masoud, who ran away with her family from Kabul when she was seven, described her personal experience.
“We were on suspicious trains and buses, suffering hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations dedicated to aiding refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double the first $5.5 million donations until the amount on the page google.com/refugeerelief reaches $11 million.
Europe has faced the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused largely by the four-year civil war in Syria, which this year left more than 4 million people relocated.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with Low Obesity May Help Obesity Surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with low-obesity type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to claim that diabetics with low obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
“Statistics of mortality do not appear immediately,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon who wrote about the new study in an editorial by JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organisms to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at a value of 18.5 to 24.9.
BMI 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery – stomach shunt and sleeve gastrectomy, with the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The mean BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, BMI in those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about the level of 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and partially - 28%.
In the group receiving drug treatment, for comparison, complete cure for diabetes was observed in only 1%, and partial cure was observed in only about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol scores “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors say.
The researchers also monitored hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But better glycemic control, reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce mortality over five years, according to study leader Dr. Chi-cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgical treatment.
At the fifth year, compared to the group who underwent sleeve gastrectomy, the shunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs 14.2 kg), achieved a greater decrease in BMI (by 7.4 vs 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%), and was closer to 16% of full remission.
Although the new study does not demonstrate the surgical method’s benefits in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, reports Blackstone, Ph.D.
According to a Swedish study, for people with obesity who chose bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying over 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group using more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with BMI below 35 to be interested in such a procedure.
"The report is very important here because it claims that such surgery is safe in a low BMI group where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient’s BMI falls in the range of 27 to 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In Mytischy, robbers took out of the house a coat and 9 million rubles.
In Mytischy, robbers attacked residents of the Moscow suburban house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two strangers entered the house on Gorky Street through an open door, tied the 20-year-old son of the housewife and, threatening with both knives, stole 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, a criminal case under the article "Theft".
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come in 2018 to watch the World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get permission.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
On the eve of the World Championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to accommodate all the guests of the city.
Interlocutors of "Rosbalt" believe that due to the tournament the cost of renting removable apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for removable housing will have to pay too much.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the first place, each hotel in St. Petersburg must pass the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St. Petersburg.
According to Vadim Vladimirov, head of the UFAS, the department has studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases involving hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antitrust.
There are indications that the management of three dozen companies deceived the townspeople by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov said.
The problem is that now on the account literally every number, not one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - single-star.
According to the first deputy of the Committee for the Development of Tourism of Nana Guichia, at the moment only 23 hotels have passed the classification - so many checks were carried out by accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But if any hotel ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny on the surprising combination of circumstances is not known.
That is, there may be more of those who have passed the classification, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months, hotels have not been very eager to go through the classification," - admitted the director of the North-West branch of the Russian Union of the tourism industry, Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason - budgets in which the costs of inspections were not set, while the procedure can cost the hotel depending on the status from 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
But lately, hotel managers have become more active and have started to submit applications for classification, Shadskaya said.
Hotels must have until 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also will not get the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that depending on the star, a fixed fee for a hotel room will be developed during the tournament.
The formulas on which the cost will be calculated will be released next year.
This is done in order to prevent price rises of 200-300%, as is the case, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and not allow a promotion two or three times, but hotels also need to be allowed to make money.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that the fixing of prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don’t know how much this fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better than an uncontrollable increase," he said.
It is unclear what will happen to popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State Duma have introduced a bill, according to which hostels should be banned in residential houses.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the point of view that hostels should be preserved," Nana Guacija said.
However, according to her, owners of mini-hotels in any case should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma approves the bill, about 80% of hostels will be closed in St. Petersburg, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restorers and Hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar, Petersburg lacks two- and three-star hotels, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a tendency towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation when "75,000 shouts are sitting in the 80,000 stadium".
This can be fixed at the expense of mini-hotels.
Their possible ban expert considers "idiotism": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason the visitors can not."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if it’s like a hotel that guests come to for a short time, why not?
Mini-hotels are at risk of missing the World Cup and because of their indestructibility.
Hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to go through the classification, and the pit is dug by themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordering works.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, but will choose those that are more expensive," - noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of passed.
The reason for the delay in St. Petersburg is due, among other things, to constant changes in the government’s tourist block, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, you will probably have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
On the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is, guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be prepared to come by vans, in which you can stay overnight.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that then they will be empty," - Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also very popular during the football championship will be the use of removable housing.
Most likely in the city will create a reserve of removable apartments.
Rent rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first will leave the housing near the stadium," - said the specialist on rental Agency of development and research in real estate Larisa Bragin.
And the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
We should not forget about the human qualities of the people.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, in which people not only tell the way, but can also take a mini-tour.
There are complications.
My father met a family from Murmansk in 1970 in the courtyard - a father, a mother and two children.
They found nowhere to sleep: with hotels it was difficult at the time, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our utility room to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
True, added that now such a trait in the inhabitants of the city is not left - to call home is full of consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "melted" the Amur region.
I admired Zhirinovsky’s clownhood in the State Duma today.
He did things like this when our generation was just learning to trade newspapers and is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, apparently, is "LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region".
The protocols do not shudder - because nothing; other protocols than those signed by the electorate, the LDPR does not seem to have.
Here he raises the second-placed Ivan Abramov and shouts something like, "Here - the winner of the election!"
Immediately, he jumps at Rodnin, and then, after a quarrel with the chairman, takes a faction out of the meeting room, shouting literally "You are all with fronts of your cheats and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarch of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
In reality, Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another outgrowth of Zhirinovsky in the style of “Fuckers!”, and not at all a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the site of the party and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader with the topic is obviously crying.
Allows the dead on Amur to bury their dead themselves, and he preaches against "United Russia" in general and innocent family.
An elegant decision to not lose a face, and not to go into a real, not showy scandal.
Another thing that is now in a strange situation is the Abrams themselves.
Apart from the shouts of the superiors, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on hand.
It is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other - for the narrow circle, it has become a formal reason for insulting the respected champion, and, more importantly, the Hamish attacks on ER and ONF.
And then, of course, he has to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the politician number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 to the only regional single-mandatory district, it can turn into a pariah, which has successfully used its own party leadership and a super-irritant for the same ONF and the party leadership of another.
Certainly, there would be no Zhirinovsky, he should have come up with and respectfully watched him.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There was news that the LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary session.
The bathroom has fallen out of nowhere.
The theme of Abram was buried beneath him.
It's really beautiful.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama touched on the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Center in Oxford, dedicated to ethics research, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that, under the present circumstances, the interests of humanity must prevail over the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while this is admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama spoke highly of the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you must think about long-term solutions to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he said.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions following the 9/11 terror attacks, saying that the U.S.’s harsh response has launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children who have swallowed hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010, in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed a high-alcohol hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, cases of children under the age of 12 swallowing hand sanitizer reported in toxicology centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children come into contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately, some percentage of them are sent to the ambulance,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant fluid specifically, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquids as a cheap drink.
Teens reportedly mixed disinfectant liquid with alcohol-containing mouthwash liquid to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to pleasant smells of disinfectant fluid.
“The child doesn’t think it could hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting hand fluids) are those that are aromatized.
There are disinfectants for the hands with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant hand fluid contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“This is high-concentration alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician at the Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t just leave such a slice of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in mind, and if kids get to them, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school in the amount of about four sprays, was sent for treatment to the ambulance.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult legally intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naiza confused the words and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury as the girl fell and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchie said.
“It was very scary,” Naji’s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to removing disinfectant liquids for hands from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active substance.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York conspired to poison their “opposite” teacher by “propagating antibacterial substances in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand sanitizers, and she has forbidden to keep them in her class.
Police believe the failed plan was “empty talk” and address the school district with questions of discipline.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul has become a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya, an iron owl grieves.
Babies who come for books try to feed her with candy.
For several generations he has been going to this library for 95 years.
The first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readings here, performed plays on Mayakovsky’s poems, conducted literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin’s wife.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper Young Stalin wrote in 1939, every day "the friendship between Nadezhda Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent her childhood photo to distant Barnaul friends once.
And when the Barnauls asked if Nadezhda Constantinovna would mind having her name assigned to the library, she wrote that no, she did not mind.
The letters have long been dusting in the museum, and the grandchildren and grandchildren of the first readers have to explain, whose harsh profile adorns the relief on the building of the library.
In the years of restructuring, different people often called, indignant: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
Krupskaya is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library hall is a yellow brick track.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager at a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and was distinguished from all other managers only by the love of drawing.
And then she found an ad on the internet: "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer."
Olya made the illustrations, and thought: life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it unless you create them yourself.
She now works in the library, illustrates children’s books by writers from all over the world and writes fairy tales herself.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space.
But we have children who read, and their parents understand the importance of reading," says Tatiana Kushvid, director of the Russian Planet Library.
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass with an updated photo exhibition.
Once a quarter, new photos are posted of readers who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and children.
The library is pleased that the popes have come more and more often with the children.
If at two years the child has read all Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more complicated.
But now there is a law that prohibits an eight-year-old wonderchild from publishing books from category 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring with him the parents - they come, then return again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something of a family club.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolutionary collection of bilines with yats and eras, to guide Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the lining of "Murzilka" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the "temple of the book", we are now open to movement, we try to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, - explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, paint together.
We made a play area for kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand is still stretched to the book!
Some of our readers are abducted by parents, and they resist with their feet, they do not want to leave.
Often mothers come with strollers - and we are pleased that the library they put in the first place among all the other places where you have to come with babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says: Modern children like us once, love classic children’s literature:
“The publishing business is developing now, and a lot of attention is paid to authors who are the link between generations.”
And when it comes to small children, it’s important for them to have some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to break up with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, which books should be paid attention to and why.
Booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that even adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden to carry books outside the reading room for adults.
This magical privilege is only for children.
In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the bookstore.
The steps will crumble under your steps - it is a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood you meet like an old comrade: hello, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie is just as cheerfully walking along the road paved with yellow bricks, the lazy Tol Ryzhikov steals magical matches, and the Boy Kibalchish never told the cursed bourgeois of the Military Secret - that's what he has a firm word for.
Such books - like passwords, they can be found anywhere.
There are also real book rarities in the repository - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of scrolls with yachts and eras.
Or lead Korolenko in the famous appendix to the magazine "Niva".
Or a Murzilki stitch for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in a tea color.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I dream of it all - I will retire and take care of rare children's books.
But children on this already, so to speak, will not be able to: and the paints in the old books are not very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write this “Pioneering Truth?”
But it was still interesting, - says Galina Ilyasova, head of the bookstore.
The pages of Murzilka have darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilyevna runs a bookstore all her life.
She knows what color of the hat Buratino has, in what school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindor team at the Quidditch Championship, in what situations Carlson uses a silencer for a motorcycle, and who Alice's father works with.
The work of a librarian is paid little, and anyone who can live without these books quickly finds another profession.
Only the most convinced are left: educators, teachers, ministers of the book cult.
They can be recognized even by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you at the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I like children’s books in general: as a librarian, I like them to be on the shelves exactly and beautifully, and I also love to read them,” says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fantasy.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think it was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me at the time.
And since I loved them insanely, it seemed to me that the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope that the books will always be, despite the readers.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children, and even grandchildren...
Rumors: There is no disagreement in the Celtic
Griffiths has denied talks about disagreements at Celtic after Dale admitted that Hopes is in a bad position, but he will fix it.
The Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could violate the team's unity.
The Dons increased their advantage over the Celtic to five points.
The penalties of Adam Rooney in the first half gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittford, which allowed Dons to break away from Celtics by five points.
Griffiths refutes talks about disagreements
This sparked rumors of disagreements at the Celtic that were suppressed by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering from any heightened criticism while preparing to meet with the Dutch League leaders.
“I don’t think we’re feeling any tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title.
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team member Ronald de Bour said Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic as he did not compete for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a representative of Ajax, said: "The Netherlands no longer shows the most attractive moments of Celtic games, but why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the "Old Firm."
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of tension in Old Firm games, and it’s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
“I’m going to change everything,” Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that the Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian coach has vowed to change everything.
Defeated by Malmö and, as a result, leaving the Champions League was soon followed by a loss to 10 players of Aberdeen, which now, having broken off by five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Dala said, "Selitka has had bad periods before, and we will come out again."
We want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I realize it’s very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what’s going on.
And so are we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic support, because that makes players a lot better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warburton awaits January transfers with distrust
Despite opinions just a few weeks ago suggesting that he set some of the goals of the January transfers, Ranger boss Mark Warberton distrusts the January campaign, claiming he doesn’t want to destroy the team’s unity.
The former Brentford striker said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, as you have seen in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Mitsu, linked to the Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to oppose the SFA over the statements of Neilson
The Harts led with a 2:1 score when they removed Paterson, and began to lose 3:2, but the defender's red card was later cancelled; this is Collum's third red card, cancelled in eight months.
Nyleson did not give up his words, claiming, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tincastle
A stubborn Haybernian player was given an excuse after admitting that he had sung a song with insulting words about former Harts player Rudy Skacela.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby at Tyncastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was hot," the striker said, adding: "I can say with confidence that I would not go back to Tin Castle if he did not play for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis Council confident in the management of "Dundee United"
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of directors of Dundee United remains confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We're going to prepare the guys to come out again," Donnelly said.
McKinness is pleased to have won the "unbelievable" at Hamilton.
Derek McKinness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against the Hamilton Assises to win the league championship for the seventh time in a row, putting them five points above the Celtics, at the top of the table, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first.
McInness said: "There is no team here that won anything - a cup or a league championship that didn't win matches like that."
The unemployment rate among Scots is not changing, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is rising.
THE number of unemployed in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was higher than that of the United Kingdom at 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 people in three months, while the number of workers now stands at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, above the average of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scottish Affairs Minister David Mandela, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the situation on the Scottish labour market as employment increases and unemployment decreases.
Why I'm a Witness to the Execution in Oklahoma
Today, by avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will be watching a person be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the suicide camera viewing gallery at Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossyp is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So why do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story about the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since they often want more than seats, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats has been reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I’ll be sitting with Richard Glossy’s closest friends, and we have our own relationship with him after months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of imparting my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she herself "could have formulated it better", but still believes that I am wrong in what I am doing.
Richard Glossip did not agree with any of what I said and wrote.
He didn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him he could delete me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, the reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I have recorded.
I'm not going to go into more detail here.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treeze make him guilty of complicit crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was insufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this angle, I'll watch him die.
I can’t say I’m completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
You will learn from me what it feels like to watch a person I like die without need.
Police chased a man to get out of the Canning River
A constable from the town of Canning Valley managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River, and to stay dry himself.
The resident of Perth intended to leave the police, but could not, stuck in the dirty water in the shallow water a few meters from the police officer, trying to "make it easy to get him off to shore".
Cunning Vale police were called on Tuesday for illegally penetrating a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by rushing to Canning.
But he didn't swim far.
“He was standing in the water and saying, ‘I’m not going out, let’s get me,’” Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Laclan Perhavets did not really want to wet the form, so he used a safer technique - "negotiating with a good policeman".
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” says Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Footballer-champion Ben Kazins remembered this.
In 2006, Kasins moved to the quay to avoid meeting a police patrol to check for alcohol, and attempted to cross Swan.
His efforts turned out to be in vain, but prompted locals to invent a joking "Ben Kazin's biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempted espionage and threatens to retire from equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to introduce a spy into his stable last year and threatened to leave the equestrian sport immediately.
His targets were the stewards and ethics staff of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of campaigning against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start due to violations of drug use rules on the day of the start, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always made every effort to participate in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Leader's test on cobalt, which he couldn't explain.
He kept his mouth shut about suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like green grapes.”
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it gets you so out of your way that you can't hold back," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep hard.
I want to walk with my head high and I want my owners to know that I’m doing my best for them.
“When they start to think it’s not, then I’ll have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would call if asked, and offered him a job in my stables to share information about what I’m doing at my stables,” Moody said in a statement.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all undoubtedly file applications, as their attempt to catch me has failed.
Robert Rollston, former RVL chairman, David Moody, current RVL chairman, and Bernard Sondry, RVL’s current CEO, have known this all along and know it now.
Isn’t that supposed to make me think it’s personal?
Shouldn’t RVL have the courage to call for accountability for what’s going on in this business, other than the coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it's the case.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now might make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and hold them accountable for making decisions.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The annoyance of the coach only grew during the long investigation of the case with cobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of the horse from the start forced him to state that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, best known for preparing the invincible Black Caviar champion, called the requirements for the use of medicines on the day of the competition "ridden" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's feet, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules of the race.
“I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the competition for the use of the compress, about which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
The driver, who committed the raid and escaped from the scene of the accident in Cobra, arrested
Police arrested a man who shot down a motorcyclist in Cobra on the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car at Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene of the accident, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in the hospital in stable condition.
Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy pares accusations of rivals in the use of harsh force techniques
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called his team's criticism of the ball's interception as "imposing an agenda" on the part of two NRL champions.
Sydney Rosters coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during a sudden Storm victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach of the Brisbane Broncos Wayne Bennett made a clear hint at the Storm after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament at the Nocern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called this game a "typical" for the rugby league team, and said that
Bellamy defended the ball's interception by his team and stated that they were simply focused on "contacting" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was inspired by the confidence of his team's criticism from the two leading coaches, as this means they are worried about a possible defeat from Storm.
“It keeps popping up — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about the tough tricks when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our systems or defense techniques for a whole year, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to the contacts when intercepting the ball, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he clearly coaches a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, and for him it’s been a bit of a shock.
It’s funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that the "St. George-Illavarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders at their speed.
This is the football you would like to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style – not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they’re a bit worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Rusters game was a competition with more points than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The game "Broncos" was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, this is impressive football?
Or to consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
With Storm at the end of this weekend, as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Crown Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb accused of drug possession released on bail of $200,000
A man facing life imprisonment for attempting to seize 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maximovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht that sailed from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Kumera in August.
Throughout the morning, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen at the harbour, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse café, where police found 40 kg of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maximovich is threatened with life imprisonment for attempting to seize narcotic drugs in a quantity sufficient to sell, Maximovich’s lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole batch, and that the man could have been in the cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovich's mother and father-in-law were asked to deposit a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
“From the testimony of both, it becomes clear that the $200,000 bail is too much financial burden for them,” Flanagan said.
But one such measure is not enough to guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he handed over both his Australian and Serbian passport, will be marked in the police daily and observe the decree from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Kacicaris: "I'm proud of the Greek national team, which fought until the last seconds."
Greece head coach Fotis Kacicaris paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 final match of Eurobasket-2015 against Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was solved by individual mistakes.
It was a great game," Kacikaris told AFP.
We were preparing for a great game performed by the Spaniards.
They tried to work in the defense, but the mistakes in the defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I will be entrusted with the functions of Kaunas at CSKA."
CSKA rookie Joel Freeland said he does not believe in the curse of the armies.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Freeland. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kauna, who left the team, we are both in the defensive structures, and in the attack.
Yes, I will need some time to adjust to the position of the center, yet in the NBA I played more forward.
Now we will have to face the big central rival more, but I have already done this before, so I think, and now I can do it.
The Germans last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but could not show their best basketball every time.
It is believed that the team has been stabbed.
This is the whole game, you can't win forever.
“Of course, it’s difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, then we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Moscowers have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSKA.
As far as eyes are concerned, I am not a superstitious person and I do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don’t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match with Roma will be special"
The head coach of "Barcelona" Luis Enrique did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with "Roma" with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the eyewitness fight of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Luis Enrique coached the “wolves” in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show his best in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, after which I gained some experience. - quotes the official website of UEFA the words of Luis Enrique. -
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It’s going to be a special game for me, but it’s not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the upcoming match.
I expect Roma to play the game she showed in Serie A against Juventus.
It’s a strong team that knows how to push and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar" has different variants of attacking actions".
The acting head coach of Ural Vadim Skripchenko on the eve of the 9th round of the Premier League with Krasnodar noted the variety of attacking schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, the bulls have several models of the game in their arsenal.
The match will take place on September 21 and will start at 16.30 Moscow time.
How we will play with "Krasnodar", we will see, - quotes the official website "Ural" word Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different options of attacking actions, conducts their attacks in a variety of ways, at the same time, and we are not a team slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is playing the Europa League against Dortmund Borussia, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Roher Kanyas: "Astana House can take glasses from anyone."
Astana midfielder Roher Kanyas after the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with the "Benfica" (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of the game of his team in the future.
According to the halfback, in their field, the Astanaians are able to pick up points from any opponent.
Despite the fact that the match turned out to be difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - quotes the official website of UEFA words Kanyas. - We did not have enough courage in the attack.
“Benfica is a top-class team, but in the home game, I think we can count on them to get their points.
It's real.
But first you have to think about Galatasaray, and then Athletico.
In home games, we can pick up points from anyone.
Rafael Benítez: “Again and again, Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.”
Real Madrid head coach Rafael Benítez expressed satisfaction with the big win in the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament with the Shakhtar (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three heads.
The match was not easy, because the Shakhtar knows how to own the ball, - the official website of UEFA says Benitez.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks always conceal danger.
“I’m not saying that Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had plenty of goals.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
“He’s the best player in the world, I’ll repeat that every time.
Jordi Alba: “Cristiano Ronaldo can’t compare to Messi”
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that no one will be able to compare with his clubmate Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, forward "Real" Cristiano Ronaldo can not do this either.
Messi is five heads higher than the rest, quotes Le Figaro Albu. - What Leo is capable of doing, no one can.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: "Barcelona has not only a unique style, but also bright individualities.
The midfielder of "Roma" Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the match of the group tournament of the Champions League with "Barcelona" noted the importance of compactness and under-insurance in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Recall, the "CE" will carry out its text broadcast.
"Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players," De Rossi said on UEFA's official website.
With blue grenades it is difficult to play, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright individuals.
To leave them, we'll have to go through the whole game and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when it comes to outfitting, so we need to keep compact and organized.
Ezhov hopes to come out in the starting line-up of the SKA in the match with "Slovan".
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hopes to come out in the starting line-up of the Army in the next match of the KHL championship.
Yezhov went on the ice instead of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute with a score of 0:3 and reflected all the throws on his goal, the fourth goal SKA missed after replacing the goalkeeper with the sixth field player.
The next game the team will play on the road against the Slovan.
I hope that I will come out in the next match in the starting line-up - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Jezhov.
I’m not an expert on goalkeepers, I’m a goalkeeper myself, we don’t show repetitions of missed goals, so it’s hard to track.
"Dynamo" played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team has lost anyway.
I would have missed more, but the team won.
Shafarzhova was taken to a hospital with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzova has been hospitalized with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.
The Czech tennis player is currently in a clinic in Brno.
The timing of the 2015 Roland Garros finalist’s recovery is not yet known.
We also recall that on Monday Shafarzhova rose to one line in the WTA ranking and is now the fifth rocket of the world.
Stephen Hogg used a girl's phone to get paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet messaging service, where he received a series of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the phone missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, after which she immediately drew the attention of her mother.
Police arrived and saw five images, after which they searched the computers found at this address, and found "appropriate" queries in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told police he did it because it could “attract paedophiles” and then he would “pretend to be a cop to scare them.”
Commissioner for Justice Eileed Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was making requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was questioned about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he has problems with his head when he drinks, and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on the phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then an eyewitness bet was made with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of taking indecent photos of children on June 14 last year, violating bail conditions on January 25 of this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, requested that Hogg not be included in the list of sexual offenders, as it could be proved that there was no "significant sexual element" in the offence.
Sheriff Alister Carmichael has postponed his sentence until October, until he receives social services credentials.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was detained prior to hearings on other remaining cases.
It was included in the list of persons who had committed sexual offences before the date of conviction.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe Reads the Wrong Speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest state leader, fell from the staircase leading from the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall immediately spread on social networks.
The opening of parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary oppositionists that they had received anonymous threats warning them against whistling at Mugabe during the address.
A month ago, they whispered to the president during his address to the nation in parliament; this is exactly what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonesse, a member of parliament for the Movement for Democratic Change, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe’s speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death'," he told reporters at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned noted members of parliament that inviolability ends in the parliament building, and as soon as they leave, parliamentary inviolability does not work.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was “concerned” by threats to her politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and reduction of service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated job cuts will amount to approximately $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“Such restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and the business portfolio will be broader and deeper, helping the company transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than ever to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing companies with previously unattainable integrated technology solutions,” the company said in a statement.
This is how a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Pacard to produce electrical equipment is divided; their garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed the “birthplace of Silicon Valley.”
Hewlett Packard is undergoing a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, is the latest development in the sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are performing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that if Wilshire’s recovery goes according to plan, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game before Christmas.
With the most favorable development of events, Wilshire will certainly miss at least four of the next games in England and, given the events, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains questionable.
The saddest thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
It's not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
These may be medically related things, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that happened to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs with the most days missed due to injuries.
Wenger acknowledges the likelihood of getting stuck in the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you get back into shape after an injury, you’re vulnerable for some time — during that time you need to regain strength and gain a competitive edge,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to do it.
I hope that he will recover physically, and I am confident that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal will start its Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match against Dynamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the team.
Hector Beljerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathieu Debussy and Arteta will play in the starting line-up.
Wenger may also include Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most disappointing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of their 41 games since they managed to play last season as the Invincible.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by an earthquake with a force of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned a lesson from last season, when the team was defeated in the game of the Champions League from Monaco, and remains with little hope of leading the club to the Champions Cup final.
“It’s an incredible drive,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with an experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedic show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate men’s need for honesty has become, now more than ever, with suicide rates among young men at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it happens to men three times more often than to women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campaign Against Unhappiness declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient had a sufficiently large number of friends “in a normal mood,” the chances of cure doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halve the chance of developing mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all it has to be.
In an age when communication is managed by social media, when style prefers content, speed of response is often valued more than content contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fun-loving, and successful, even if in reality loneliness reigns.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner striving for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire, the creator of video games, recently noted, for money you can not actually buy more happiness.
The value of Friends is that they attract attention to it.
Each of the characters was determined not by their work, but rather by a personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey’s humor and constant embrace of Chandler, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross’s sigh at Rachel—all stem from an understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full study of their feelings.
As a Samaritans employee told me: “...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, emphasizes how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit.”
Often, those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of “live with it” is strong, as is the feeling that a frank conversation about problems can be perceived as a weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-lasting mechanisms of overcoming.
It highlighted the inconspicuous moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider talking on the phone helps people in times of despair, and long-term support comes from close family and friends.
So if you’re visiting FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the decorations have been completely restored for the holiday, why not take your friends to drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say "Hi."
You don’t know in advance what kind of benefit friendship can bring.
Friends show on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, by tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal to help PSG defeat Malmö
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matuidi and Edison Cavani, celebrates the balls scored at the Malmö gate.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed PSG to easily bypass Malmö on Tuesday.
Here is a report on the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edison Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with a very comfortable 2–0 win against Malmö at the Park de Prince Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after starting his first game in the Champions League as a PSG player to set the direction for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and the Donetsk Shakhtar in Group A, the Paris had to make a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, as they did not aim to qualify for the playoffs, but to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blan to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in a game against the team from his hometown and club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so winning with a 2-0 score, delivering problems to the opponents and playing well in defense is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to finish over the course of the season," he said.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I'm sorry we didn't score one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the substitutions in the Paris team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2:2 in the match against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed back to the back of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was noted as a player capable of taking PSG to a new level in Europe after being bought back from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran away on a pass from Marco Verratti behind the defense of Malmö, he finished beautifully at the attack, leaving Vijay.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big victory from PSG then they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, which defeated the Celtics in the playoffs to reach this stage, having nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two supportive midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of Nicola Giurgi<0xC4><0x87>’s strike, in which the ball flew past Kevin Trapp’s long goal pole in the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
However, PSG sometimes failed himself with ineffective transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who was unable to perform at least five attempts only in the first half, and then could not process the ball scored by Kavanaugh immediately after the game resumed.
However, he proved much more skillful in precise passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovi<0xC4><0x87>, receiving which, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted punch, which passed a sneak peek to the pole past Vilanda for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour mark thanks to Kavanaugh, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball of the season after Ibrahimovic tipped the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only intercepting the ball by Willand from a close distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final score before the substitute Ezekiel Lovesy was counted a goal at the very end of the match.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class higher than his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, and that is not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory to "Paris"!
It was a great match with them.

The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive with an official visit to the United States later this month.
The visit, Xi Jinping’s first visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be a response to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liuan, at a government dinner on the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.

During the debate, the prosecutor asked Mirzoev to be sentenced to three years in prison and to claim from him the full amount of the claims of the victims - eight million rubles.
The accident in question occurred on 22 May at about three o’clock in the area of house 30 on Kutuzovsky Avenue.
The BMW car, behind the wheel of which was Mirzoev, crossed the opposite lane and knocked down a motorcyclist standing on the sidelines.
A man born in 1989 died on the spot from injuries.
Friends of the deceased on social media reported that the BMW driver was driving at high speed and before the accident went to the opposite lane.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape responsibility, the bikers organized a motorbike race from Vorobyevo Mountains to the building of the GUMVD of Moscow on Petrovka, 38.
Soon after, it became known that the investigation following the results of the interrogation detained the alleged culprit of the accident.

More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by the governor of the Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, at a meeting of the presidium of the regional government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds to educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds are directed to purchase a bus for one of the schools of the Nizhnetavdinsky district, for the capital repair of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will go to the completion of the capital repair of the second floor of the therapeutic office.
Repair of hot and cold water supply networks, drainage, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be carried out, the facades of the building will be put in order, the premises will be renovated, a complex of fire safety and energy saving activities will be implemented.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, a second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Tyumen delegation, led by the governor, will participate.
About the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation, the Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, Vladimir Shuglya, who was part of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It builds on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, which are important links between the two States.
It is planned that the plenary session will be attended by the President of Russia Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
Within the framework of the plenary and sectional meetings, we will talk about the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory support and programs of the Union State.
The Governor of Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I believe that this indicates a successful and sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be held, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new lucrative contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, participated in its work.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our findings is also evidenced by the fact that a permanent seminar was held at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training personnel for agriculture, to identify additional contact points and to organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev spoke about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end consumer.
Problems in the work of the Tyumen trading house "Belshin" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
Issues are important, as investment projects must work clearly and bring profits to the region.
There was talk of further supplies of passenger and cargo equipment of OJSC "MAZ", development of the service center of OJSC "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of OJSC "TPATP".
The conversation also touched on the preparations for the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another topic of discussion was the conclusion of the agreement and signing of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation of the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relations promises to reach a new level.
These questions also concern the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tyumen Alexander Moore we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
Around 100 buses are already “breathing in the incense”, which is why a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will work on gaseous, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen Elevator Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products of JSC "Mogilevliftmash", receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for the installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within the extended powers of the consul, a meeting with the governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, was held, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaurale was discussed.
A meeting with the Governor of Omsk is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five Russian subjects, but Tyumen can be called a peculiar headquarters of the district.
The region is a platform for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they allow to solve many problems directly and quickly, removing their acuity and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is extremely important not to break the bar while continuing to work on the prospect.
Matt Damon opposes focusing on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in filmmaking
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, stating behind the scenes that ethnicity is not necessary.
During the Sunday release of Project Greenlight on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black character in the script chosen for the project.
“Diversity is appropriate when you’re casting for the movie itself, not for the show,” Damon said.
Shattered Brown, not believing her ears, indignantly shouted "Aw! Nothing to herself. Well, well" all the time, while the actor from "Marsian" gave comments live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown joined co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers.
“I’d like participants – no matter who’s going to be the director – to think about what interpretation of the Harmony image they’re going to stick to,” Brown said at the start of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute, who is beaten by a white brat.
Dear White People's producer advocated that the film be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was sharply opposed, saying that "in the end we may not get what we want".
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproving comments against Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni said: “Explaining the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black person in the room is SO WHITE that it hurts.”
Twitter has more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s statements appear just when literate coverage of a racial topic in the media is the most acute issue on the agenda of public discussion.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against black people.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the nomination of the contenders in the "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
“The albums still matter,” he said.
Like the books and lives of black people, albums still matter.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News associate Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group will be considered a group of haters.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the movement’s leaders said in a statement.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business figures, producers and media magnates invited to visit Pope Francis to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
The professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldero on Monday evening became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home the prize of 1 million dollars.
At this sports show, whose 7th season has just ended, none of the participants have yet managed to pass all stages of the track with obstacles.
In the final of the season two participants - Caldero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included climbing the rope 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task and settled in the set time, becoming the first athlete in American Ninja Warrior history to pass the exhausting stage 4, but Calderón managed the task three seconds faster, making him a winner.
After the victory, Calderón, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
"Thinking about it is unbelievable, I've never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E!.
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined how it happens... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wide met with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who first crossed the track, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
“If there are more than one finishers, the fastest one gets the prize,” Wide said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes lives, it still receives tremendous satisfaction.
I don't think he feels offended about this.
He's happy with what he's done.
He received tons of enthusiastic feedback from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I'm destined to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we changed roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are quietly circumventing the Minnesota Twins.
Minneapolis – The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams of all time, the Tigers now occupies the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming only to be a nuisance, the Tigers won with brilliance Tuesday at the Minnesota Twins with a 5-4 finish at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to cut their half-game distance from the Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs in the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was a return of the word to the letter F, which slipped away from them for most of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how they are made,” Tigers manager Brad Osmuss said.
Pitcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, as a result of which Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three innings.
It was only his third good start in nine games.
“I just want to finish the year with good results,” Simon said.
Pitchers can’t throw in every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
The appointed striker "Tigers" Victor Martinez managed to beat three strikes and scored two injuries - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day of three strikes since four strikes in the game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He did a good job,” Osmus said.
He showed himself well in (the quality of a better one), noticeably better in the work of a beat and kept that quality for the game.
Having scored three innings in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back into the game.
Byron Buxton, the central receiver, opened the innings by doubles on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making the bant, took the first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier got a strike-out on a whirlwind from Simon before his place was taken by leftist Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overtook Moore, the only player on the way, before newly appointed striker Miguel Sano, who beat the two-run "single" to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners not in the car and comparing the wound on the second base VerHagen managed to lead the third baseman Trevor Pluff to a double play.
This was the 27th time for a top-league player this season when Pluff pulled the ball out of a double play.
After Detroit added an under-insurance injury in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned RBI a "dumble" into the space between the outfielders against closing pitcher "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-hander kicked Sano out after three strikes and received his fifth seed.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was temporarily untrained at the beginning of the game.
The Tigers earned three innings in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the injured list before the game itself, missing for more than a month due to low back inflammation.
"It's definitely not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable and so I was able to make a few pretty good throws in the third inning."
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes dropped the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A walk at two outs by Wrightfielder J. D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first injury in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 for 21" series with the runners in the result position.
Third-base player Nick Castellanos then made a "single", bringing another injury, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to approach the third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, receiving a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from central striker Anthony Gauss, and the score was 3-0.
“It was a powerful hit,” Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn’t hit very well, but he got to the right point.
Hughes, whose throws were thought to have been thrown in a third inning, was then replaced by the right-handed releaser A. J. Achter.
Hughes counted three wounds on six hits and a walk with four strike-outs.
REMARKS: Right-hand pitcher "Tigers" Anibal Sánchez was kicked out of the players due to the stretch of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who underwent shoulder surgery on Sanchez back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to be released on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and go against the Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for David Price's left-handed pitcher on July 30, has 1 win and 1 defeat.
He has not participated in the games since August 20 due to stretching of the oblique muscle.
Tigers and Twins will complete a three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play right-hander Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadyrov's original complaint about the book "Prayer to God" was submitted to the South Sakhalin court.
The South Sakhalin City Court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision on the recognition of the book "Request to God: its meaning and place in Islam", reports "Interfax" with reference to the president of the city Alexand.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the proceedings.
Chukhray refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to check the ground for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such nonsense themselves," he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinska Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal on Friday night.
There are nuances: the prosecutor’s office believes that they have asked the court to recognize extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not the verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the judge made the wrong decision,” Chuhray said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was taken on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremists" were called quotes from the Qur'an - "We worship You and ask You for help", "Do not invoke anyone besides Allah."
Kadyrov called the decision-makers of the book "the devils and provocateurs".
He called on the deputies of the State Duma to legally prohibit judicial decisions concerning the texts of the sacred scriptures.
“I am firmly convinced that the State Duma must pass a law that prohibits judicial decisions directly related to the texts of the Qur’an and other Divine Scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote on Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give negative ratings to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the Facebook leadership is intended jointly with the Ministry of Justice of Germany.
The head of the department, Hayko Maas, said that the Ministry of Justice is currently working with social network specialists to create a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and remove inaccurate comments regarding migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for their deletion.
Organizations whose specialists are collecting complaints from users of the social network about offensive posts should also facilitate the rapid blocking of illegal content.
The Facebook leadership intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements to migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was taken after the German segment "Facebook" sharply increased xenophobic moods.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis of its scale, which hit the EU countries some time ago.
Thus, in Germany, all the places intended for the accommodation of refugees are already crowded.
On the eve of the country’s authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa were placed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeteries there will be areas for relaxation.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovskoe, Domodedovo, and Shcherbinsky cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troyekurovsky cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will appear in other areas of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, occupying the position of head of the State budget institution "Ritual".
Areas for relaxation will represent small landscaped areas reminiscent of parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors to the cemeteries will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, areas for relaxation will be built in Domodedovo, Butov and Shcherbinsky cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forests as much as possible.
The green plantations will serve as a live fence, which will separate the rest areas and areas allocated directly under the burial grounds.
Experts of GBU "Ritual" also announced their intention to make a proposal for the rejection of fences at burials.
New cemeteries can indeed become barrier-free.
In addition, GBU "Ritual" told about the readiness to engage in the installation of electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to cemeteries will be able to learn GPS coordinates and number plates of burials.
In June of this year, GBU "Ritual" also offered to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging graves in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in the winter, when the earth is frozen.
Over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, a lost mushroom was found in the forests of Yelnin.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.
The fungus was detected thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Aleksandr Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food and water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even kinologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was detected after a helicopter was connected to the search work.
That day, Vitaly Aleksandrovich, as usual, went to the forest for buttocks and heels, but did not return by the evening.
Relatives immediately sought help, and the next day rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village - only about 30 people - were raised to search for the fungus.
On the fifth day, the helicopter of the fire rescue center joined them.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Fire and Rescue Center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
I went a long way, somewhere else.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He went a long way at his age.
The miracle survived.
The fungus was taken to the central district hospital in Yelnin, unconscious, in an extremely serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia of the body.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the forest, the doctors do not know.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Yelnin CRB: "Patient examination, treatment is prescribed."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Given all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaliy Aleksandrovich comes to Smolensk from Tambov region every year.
His grandson says that his grandfather had previously gone to collect mushrooms, but never went deeper into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom farmer, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, in principle it is not local."
Literally several years came to visit, to visit relatives.
Well, he went after the mushrooms.
Apparently he went a long way and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
In the last few days, there have been five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to walk in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and compass.
In addition, it is advisable to leave traces so that you can then go back.
Emergency An-2 sat on average in the brotherly taiga.
Directly on the average village in Siberia emergency An-2.
The emergency landing of the aircraft of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisey" carried out at 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities and casualties, but the plane itself suffered significant damage on landing.
An-2 made a service flight.
There were three crew members on board - a commander, a second pilot and a mechanic, according to Interfax.
The emergency plane made a flight on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the aircraft has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Brotherly Transport Prosecutor's Office after the emergency landing of the An-2 began to verify compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
An investigative team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office was taken to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their plane with passengers due to a technical failure at the abandoned Taegu airport in Komi.
The aircraft failed engines and onboard electronics, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in the emergency landing.
News Economics <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Nobel Laureate: Globalization
The processes of globalization were supposed to contribute to the reduction of inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the difference in the income of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, says the chief researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Selection of Decisions of the University of Uzbekistan, the winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics Erik Maskin.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
The trade frontiers between countries were becoming more and more open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted great benefits for developing economies.
“These predictions have come true in many ways,” Maskin said.
China and India, for example, have experienced significant growth in GDP per capita.
However, not everything is so joyful.
Globalization was expected to bridge the gap between the “wealthy” and the “poor” in poor countries, which is manifested in large income inequalities, or more precisely, in wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskkin in his article “Why Global Markets Haven’t Reduced Inequality in Developing Economies,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, which is translated and quoted by NIE HSE.
Together with Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalization grows, according to NIE HSE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin assigns four levels of qualification of specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the level of qualification to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries increase their wages by cooperating with B-level employees from the rich, then D-level workers do not feel or their wages are falling at all.
The end result is that the internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the wage gap between the two categories of Professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, to an increase in inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin offer a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It allows us to explain why globalization has led to income inequality,” says Fuad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Selection of Decisions, head of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Uzbekistan.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to an outbreak of empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Erik Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as noted by the scientist, do not have the funds for this, and companies are not profitable to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, according to Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory does not in any way call for the cessation of the process of globalization, which has brought and is bearing its fruits in the form of the growth of GDP of countries.
Derbent: the living connection of time.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities in Russia, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of festive events includes the festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of derbent carpets and the Open Temple Day, a historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
Medieval stones of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this seems to have come down from the pages of "Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazarian Khanate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern plains, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - monuments of living nature".
The shadow of scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor of the mosque will be poured aromatic tea and will be served with Dagestan delicacies - honey figs, currants, mushrooms, miraculous bulbs, airan and sweets.
In Derbent, large samovars have been used for centuries to drink tea for numerous guests at once.
An inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque indicates that the building was built in 115 AD by the Hijra.
In the year 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is impressive in scope and solemnity: arcades of domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the sun's rays from tiny windows.
The keeping and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Poultry owners put blueberries in the yards, under the trees, on the attic.
An exciting spectacle is the ascent into the sky of flocks of white pigeons, similar to flashes of festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this structure closed the port of Derbent.
In 2003, the Derbent Fortress was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets for any taste are sold - stripes of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with and without a spruce, with a complex ornament and a quaint chalk.
The construction of the city began with the Magalhães - neighborhoods with single-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the magic has hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioning on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in the medieval, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the water supply, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago, have been preserved.
To this day, ancient springs have arrived, in which the locals still collect water.
Many Derbents prefer ordinary tap water to water from verified historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of pottery.
Watering and painted vases, dishes, jars, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters are still making wonderful ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a stretched rope, on which the students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship spans several centuries.
A new trend - among rope climbers, you can see more and more girls.
The museum "Culture and Life of the Ancient Derbent" now operates in the premises of the former Girl's Bath.
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here in the company of friends, but now anyone can see a vaulted dome hall, hot and cold pools, left in the past for bathing.
Most Derbent houses have hot water, but baths and steam baths are as popular nowadays as they used to be.
The benefits of heating the body with steam are written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and lightness.
The festival "Community", which takes place on the territory of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, participates ethnic groups of many areas of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and serve visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kyrkhlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who bowed their heads to Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
Yellowed sarcophagi are carved out of solid stone blocks and oriented, as is customary for the Arabs, along the west-east axis.
The brothers Gavril and Albert Jacob cut and shave their clients in a small salon near the Upper Bazar.
The hairdresser has been in this place for many years.
The techniques of cirule craft are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Jacob brothers can make not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City, there was a house where the writer Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, who was exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
Having learned the Turkish language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the nineteenth century with his ancient monuments, life and life of the citizens.
Chaihana is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, to chat with friends and to solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not recommended to exceed the threshold of the teagan.
Derbent dance ensemble "Caspian" was created three years ago, but already managed to take part in the events of the republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, perfectly learning folk Avar, Dargin, Tata, Armenian dances.
With the arrival of the evening, when the noise is silenced and the street lights are lit, the locals sit on benches near the houses with terraces.
As a rule, derbents discuss household matters.
But on the eve of the jubilee, they increasingly remember episodes of the unique history of their city, which affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo there was a business "game at the airport".
There is a new form of education in the capital.
Hundreds of students have tried themselves as airport staff.
For this purpose, three aircraft models were installed in Domodedovo.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served aircraft.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in difficulty it did not give way to reality.
Late flights, immediately two passengers with fractures on board, the staircase was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
The actual airport is hell.
For the one who settled in the hangar Domodedovo - a standard set of tasks that will be solved by beginners.
Three major airports from different countries were accommodated in one hangar.
They currently employ 400 students from the capital’s colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of aviation.
Check-in of passengers, service of aircraft, luggage turnover - they were entrusted even buses on the flight field, stairs and inspection of passengers.
Passengers are always problematic.
One had a mess with the documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And to deal with all this, as in life - in the minimum time.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual cash, as if the airline paid them the corresponding amounts for the service of the flight.
"For the non-performance of the relevant tasks, they are fined," explains in an interview with the program "Vesti-Moscow", the financial analyst of the game Dmitry Hilko.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring this.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of learning.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
"Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will be, in fact, new models of the activities of modern colleges with modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment," - says the director of the Department of State Policy in the field of training of workers and additional professional image.
But students are not up to the global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a weekend.
But the assessments for this exam had quite a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for responding to the claim to our airport on Instagram in a timely manner," said Sergey Shuvalov, the game's co-manager of Frankfurt Airport.
The best judges, which is called, took on a pencil to invite to work by the time of graduation.
The U.S. embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the U.S. Center for Foreign Literature operating under the Library.
The center has been operating in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library named after M.I.Rudomino in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times put into question the commitment of the Russian government to relations between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations of our countries,” U.S. Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement.
The American Center has created deep and strong connections between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place with numerous American prominent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Just last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX educational exchange program (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was swift to be executed.
Typical situation: four officials stand at the table of Judge Svatanter Kumar, listening to his claims to the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order to make fun of it," Kumar said.
If at least one more brick is laid, we will order all existing buildings to be demolished.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judiciary body established in 2010 to stop the rapid environmental pollution that has accompanied the tumultuous economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has had time to consider more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological developments, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop construction leading to pollution.
The rates are unbelievably high: in the less than 60 years since the declaration of independence, India has transformed from a virgin jungle country into one of the world’s most overpopulated and polluted countries.
The problem is particularly acute in large metropolises, where the development of infrastructure does not follow the rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste of enterprises and households, and few remaining residential areas have been erected.
Despite the formal support of the green movement from the state, NZT is regularly criticized by the Narendra Modi government, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of the largest investment projects.
In May, the environment minister called the court's decisions "extreme" and "unenforceable".
Sometimes the court’s decision is indeed impossible to execute within the deadline set by the court, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjvani.
However, unenforceable deadlines also have a positive side: at least they make the responsible people move.
“His main goal is to disrupt this system,” the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly cancelled major constructions: on its account, the cessation of the construction of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people also try not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana, which contaminated the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar said.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed thanks to a single raster of the judge's feather.
In April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused widespread outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and a surge of criticism, Svataner Kumar refused to revoke the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Delhi government statistics on incoming and outgoing motor vehicles, and also made a proposal to buy 10,000 additional buses, knowing in advance at factories whether they were able to fulfill such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents began to fall into the sphere of attention of the court, people’s anger began to fade.
But the most sickening theme of the principled judge was the Ganges River Cleanup Program, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a river sacred to the Hindus, the judge often stops restraining his emotions and goes on to scream.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges onto the statue of God, and there were feces in it, the judge says.
You keep polluting the river because you think Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
This is the river that we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The Gange Cleanup is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Every year, 1.5 to 3 of the 700 million Hindus bathing in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganga Rescue Fund from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while at least eight billion was needed to clean the river.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the price of progress should be the ecology.
“In a developing country, environmental talks are often perceived as an unacceptable luxury,” said Malika Bhanot, a Gang Call activist.

Xi Jinping urges to make the economy more open to the world
The economy should become more open to the world to boost its growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, addressing the group that faces the challenge of leading reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness,” he said, referring to the participants of the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Leading Group on Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
According to him, the expansion of openness and deepening of reforms will give the economy a new momentum and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The Leading Group has adopted a number of directives, including on regulating investor access to the market, changing border control rules, encouraging public enterprises (SOEs) to attract private capital and revising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be compiled.
The system will be gradually debugged through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in the allocation of resources, ensuring legality in the business sphere and increasing openness, as stated in the statement.
The government will also weaken control over the authority it gives to companies, thus ensuring that companies will run their own businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to master new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of government-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies, as well as provide them with better conditions," the statement said.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or "green card", will be further facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the filing process itself.
The meeting also discussed the provision of lawyers ' rights and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
