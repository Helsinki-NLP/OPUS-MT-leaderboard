Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A madhouse where young people are supposed to meet today.
A grave chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners farm the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to the day.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who has ever had to get upset knows this, because the car-navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the Bavaria digital atlas, an offer of the Bavaria geoportal of the state government, are anything but current - but precisely for this reason very informative.
Especially when you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the Munich Mercury distribution area have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a spotted carpet that is not immediately recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
These were created between 1810 and 1864, according to the Bavarian Measuring Authority, and are derived from the first measurement of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoléon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical image of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, establishing the "Topographische Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Vermessungsverwaltung.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found, like all others, on the website of the Bavarian State Library.
The comparison Previous/Today is the most impressive in the example of the country's capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was drawn up, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasants' revolt against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered corridors from the so-called "reception", from which the land tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers there today - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt in the area of the present-day district of Au-Haidhausen you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstrasse people were once locked up with delusions.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich County Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüften" was founded.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called insane.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, which has been involved in an exhibition with the institution.
There was room for 280 patients at first, and later it was expanded to 500 places.
At one point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circular institution in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost has been located there, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.
Young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich on the premises of the former Auer institution.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west is the football field of TSV München Ost, to the east houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - architecturally based on the original construction of the madhouse, which had been destroyed in World War II by bombings.
The Marienplatz was listed as the "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where on these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the spatula for the second S-Bahn line will take place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with today's aerial image - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled.
Civil Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color travelling to Missouri because of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, racially based incidents have occurred in the state in recent times," the statement said.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state’s law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed,” said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, to the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, after having run out of gasoline during his trip through the state and being detained by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showing that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites in the state.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared whether to bring bail or let relatives know they are traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Grass fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the spot.
At the Schwendemann family law court, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals as possible, and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest Milk" is the alternative way of marketing the milk of his cows, Schwendemann said.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "elementally important".
I can't make profits on such steep surfaces.
The green area provides a lot of work, a lot of work has to be done with the engine sense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and the topography here," Schwendemann said.
In 2003, he took over the parent farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is pleased with the Leader support".
At a cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the areas to be extended for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and worry about how they will continue their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised for their subsidies.
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced through the pasture fence promotion in 2013.
The open holding area is thus 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half was funded through Leader, and a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers were left with 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: “You are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers you can’t do it.”
Peter Weiß also stated: “Here the best food is produced.”
The Landscape Court Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state funding of pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be towing-manageable (hanging above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels is currently running, who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The open holding area corresponds to 35 hectares, the estimated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House takes on the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other – hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 at Firdos Square in Baghdad.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime’s key ideologists, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe into a heated dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so.
But he addressed their significance, and in particular the significance attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller insulted Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you are referring to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the upheavalous words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely, / the poorest of the fallen."
There has never been a time when the "eager waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s USA.
This conflict over the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural controversy: it is in fact a conflict over the significance of America.
Lazarus – and her friends who were committed to placing their words at the base after her death – knew very well that they were committing a highly political act.
The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing have long wanted to reverse this.
The big-necked Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not an invitation to anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the overnight world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way into the United States.”
Quite unusually, Limbaugh came across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, that’s not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to ignite the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members of the UK
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
Neil Black, the UK’s athletics performance director, said the 16-man Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad “will make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we’re trying to understand it, and we’ll continue to do it until we find out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And the guy at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medallists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black said.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally were great."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup so far was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The midfielder Muir leads on this path and has set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "hugely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other team members, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
“Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb the podiums.
What about my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it’s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don’t apply for a public office if you can’t stand the heat of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He sneered at the criticism, for sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away – and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to the slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was filled with a backlash with "Well, what?".
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people coming to the Governor’s side – which is a public forum called official and by employees paid with public tax dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in the comment section of the news channel The Post.
"I also don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor’s employees called a “concentrated spam attack” would likely be called “foreplay.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
But that’s exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for slandering Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondents attacked his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius” wrote all letters to newspapers that downplayed Washington’s decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stance on the Amity treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led to the finals last year in Archerfield Left before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we’re seeing it reach its glory with this event,” Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place up.
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It really feels special," said the Southport-based player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action at home.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy about how it went so far.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer death from passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
To this result, scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are attributable to passive smoking per year," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew his own study on this issue from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking in Germany each year.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections turn out to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is somewhat in time", says the head of the building, Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is much hiding in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stump.
"The ignorance of drivers about red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road is blocked and only the line buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stump have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were very stressful.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt supplied us with cool mineral water,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually lays a sweet potato - referred to locally as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote through a public uprising before the occupying forces.
An existing movement that revolted for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as secluded as it is deserted. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs that have been transformed into various yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her light skirt.
"We used to only have leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles away from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, which ensures that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains an astounding presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in the tribal highlands of Papua in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We’ll lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of last year’s atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular according to another report – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua’s resources bring in an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Locals are struggling to keep up.
“The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, pledged to address inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua’s 29 districts – including Paniai – on his way to Jakarta’s Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, expecting him to fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You said.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside singing Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took a shot at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk chased and beat the group with their rifle pistons, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A 16-year-old boy, Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire, and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was warmed up, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official TIME document that was not released to the local media.
Jeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only carries a name, the TIME in a grim mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was being attacked.
“We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua Police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings did not come to Jakarta until the next day.
For three weeks, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuses in Papua.
“I want this case resolved immediately so it won’t happen in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through,” he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN with “crimes against humanity” that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s 1999 bloody independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations have already been resolved in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with bitter disbelief.
“I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress,” Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniaia's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there will be revenge," said 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being quickly delivered here, according to TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a disturbance to the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by inciting sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
The people here build everything they eat: especially notes and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can each process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the natives of Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
“Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain tightened by international media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were deported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s campaign promises to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua’s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations and told reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to conceal the evidence for human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressured him “We want freedom,” according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," said Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuas, view their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" he has to pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, the families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site directly opposite the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire catches the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its way through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
“We slept and we woke up at the fire alarm and the screams of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name to George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said the firefighting units extinguished the fire around 4 a.m. local time (0 a.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing housing for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage from the cladding, outer cladding to decoration or insulation came.
In the UK, police said they believe the system of plates for insulation and disguise at London’s Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has passed through the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two sets of winnings was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but are also very appreciated for this reason, remain the traditional competition.
63.54% of the member states voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was almost missed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the application process.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had already been put to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: Thus, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training places etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers take prohibited items on a plane, a survey finds out
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent of illegal or unauthorized items smuggled past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed to have discovered late that they had traveled by mistake with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people – conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent, who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed on to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through the safety check, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs on board the plane.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many smuggled goods had accidentally been brought through airport security and how many had deliberately done so.
It’s no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggling goods – knowingly or unknowingly – through security were the ones who flew the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of the items seized by the TSA are liquids.
For a time, people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggling.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk: Thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has underestimated the fact that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the increasingly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time a different, less glossy figure in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance sheet: that of the cancellations on the new mass market model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, whose delivery is just beginning.
Musk admits that out of 518.000 pre-orders, 63,000 have been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will reimburse the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 (US$1,000 in the US and <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 in the UK) "reservation deposit" in full.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth goals lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it is expected to be - all models combined - 500,000, in 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a Model 3 today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest – if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never-tested production lines with maximum utilization without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in masses.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws because of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It is a deadline that expires on October 1st for states to comply with the 2015 standards for near-soil ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid “interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth.”
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turn to ozone standards simply reinforces the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," Pruitt said, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that it gives us seriously.”
However, the EPA’s opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use his “authority to delay and all other legal powers available” to ensure that the regulations are “based on a sound policy and the best information available.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft law passed last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA – according to our complaints – is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered over Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crusade of the Trump administration, offering ourselves to environmentalists and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750th Anniversary of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius resort is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the Sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
Rescuing and preserving the oldest building in the town have made Tumlingen’s friends and supporters their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique small village death".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Papers: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen along with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the text of the document, on Tumlinger Berg, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a royal court to which the church or patronage law belonged and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village map of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the ruling settlement center of the village.
Old maps from around 1600 support these historical facts.
Patronage law originated from early medieval ecclesiastical property law.
A gentleman who built, equipped and occupied a church with a priest continued to own this church and could also inherit this own church.
This included the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The largest of the two splits at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be issued later in World War II in 1942.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the window panes were stolen and the bells were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today is preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Pensionnern" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
On Sunday, July 16, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth serenade at the old cemetery at the St. Hilariu Chapel.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local head Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.
For the resonance of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope to have many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for thumbs and earplugs.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to have the approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see any legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim resists" has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was done illegally.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at that time there was only a wind turbine concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal in Viersen.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind energy concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier through a change in the land use plan, the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning law, the authorization issued is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim defends itself".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the City Council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval by the district government is still pending.
Recognizes: "At this point, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law".
The district confirms receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received since last week by the Kreis Viersen," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them as an occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings before the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim defends itself" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200-meter-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11,400 households can be covered - this corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Linnich near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at about 10 am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road was closed for hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich drove the L 333 in her car as part of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as an escort in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealers plan "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the downtown area in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure residents to the downtown shopping mall.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend is supposed to raise customers' awareness of what offers the city provides outside of the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional providers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center will invite you to the "Midnights-Shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus, the trade association and the city enter another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Brunnenfest, including an open Sunday of sales, conversations with all operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the renunciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be re-opened or re-opened.
This includes tourists and tourists.
But many locals also lost sight of the downtown area when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the downtown - up to the landlords, the businesses of the whole city and the clubs.
It applied to overcome with a network the lethargy that had spread in part, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that five Thuringian cities will take part in the third national "Heimat-Shopping" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", said Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
A gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis has killed two people and injured nine others, some of them severely.
According to the firefighters on Wednesday (local time) was another injured in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was later recovered.
The dead were school staff members.
As a cause of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump puts pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls over payment of border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president rebuked him for publicly denouncing the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern U.S. border, and vowed to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade deal for the U.S. to take over refugees who emigrated to Australia would be “ridden,” “my” and “stupid,” and that insisting on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a “depp” after he had a ban on resettlement of U.S. refugees in the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, “this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day.”
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Re-evaluate Racism Lynchakt as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, rushing to the Ford Moore Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men stepped out with rifles to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle-stripe suit - took a long pull at his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n----r Roger!" shouted the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams broke the silence when a young black man was dragged out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, played on July 22, is just a replay.
But then when a string is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience threw out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"It's really unbelievable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the resettlement.
“It’s a dirt spot on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman for the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the repetition serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A coroner puts a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch trial.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign.
Approximately at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight – allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcolm’s wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
“As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders,” an FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, eliminating evidence and concealing the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was a right-to-election massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you get registered and if you vote, then this will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has been leading the annual follow-up to the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
His portrayal is vivid, compelling, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the lynch, because then we will be confronted with its uglyness in all of us,” she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or listen to what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest blacks – rushed into a room and listened as Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role would never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not that way,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, playing Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm yelling at the horse and squeezing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, vanish from my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughed the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still laughing.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--he' back then."
"Yes," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R'."
And that’s where the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, gunshots, and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the actors' bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mourning praise "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes away sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They’ve all experienced Georgia’s oppressive moisture for nearly eight hours as Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the Malcoms and Dorseys burial grounds.
To this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy murmurs as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then breaks down crying in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispered.
“We know it’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta talks excitedly about the match with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that felt the performance had left.
“It’s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she said.
"What that really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and remembering the civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The adaptation is inspiring in a way because it describes the horrors of what we've endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, it can happen again.
He who does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is doomed to repeat it."
"Dawn of the Gods" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf bets on a colorful-frivolous staging in front of a giant, six-story backdrop.
The stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) displays optionally a shabby street corner with wall rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open Mercedes-Oldtimer, in which the Rhein daughters pose as rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf’s guiding theme – money, power and greed – that draws from his “ring” staging.
The three Rhein daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tears a body into the trunk in a Hollywood way and gives the Krawallo cliché.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty hymn that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Oake) also has to believe it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humble themselves and bow their hands to Merkel’s advice, are celebrated in a stormy manner.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows for the first time on stage - in the face of the great heat again in casual casual clothes.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was eagerly awaited.
If he had yet to have a valid whistle-blower concert in 2013, five years later there was a great celebration, in which the occasional "Buh" shouts fell.
Festival manager Katharina Wagner should have been happy about it.
"You notice that the audience has grown up with the 'ring' in some way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of his point of view.
I'm going to make a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked at the school all day long.
What is your experience with this?
Quantity: It’s a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so you are a late-stage volunteer.
How did that come about?
Quantity: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully interrupted.
I realized for myself that it’s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, in the focus maybe also, real.
And was it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social sciences in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training in the Youth Office Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn’t it unusual to have several different missions during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from nursing home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really went.
Unlike in engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee or a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you weren't afraid of touch?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
Sometimes there are negative moments, but that’s how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 percent as another restructuring program is being launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.
The job cuts, which Director-General John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to his previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs were already lost.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in a third cost reduction program to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged after reaching an increase of 1 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last act of violence in Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement, NATO said the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-carried improvised explosive device".
The statement says all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since US-led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular in President Ashraf Ghani’s reputation.
EPA reverses decision to delay Smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay Obama’s administration’s regulation requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday its decision to advance the so-called “ozone regulations 2015” and said it showed the agency’s commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA’s intention to delay the ozone regulations – which will measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental restrictions imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, aims to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have triggered the backlash of Democrats and conservation groups, who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says inhaling air that contains ozone “can reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
The Council wants a common space
In the end, the decision was clear: by two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a community space in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still be a long time before the area previously owned by the church community is owned by the municipality, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on a common area for this.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose to provide such a common space as a meeting place not only for the residents of the elderly, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word from the "strickcafé" made the round.
The decision already made by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn is sweetened by the possibility of funding.
The construction is in the renovation area.
The establishment of a community area would, according to Tjaden, be eligible with 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to be thrown a button between his legs in this respect, provides for the finding that both saddles - which is based on the environment - and a roof - which reduces the height of the trough and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Unnecessarily, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, be this addition.
If it helps, he passes the panel unanimously.
It is not so easy in the community.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many of her own buildings, with which one does not get so straight ahead, but now leaning at the common room from the window, she says: "I'm having a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the community space - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to wealthy or even foreign investors anyway.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a grant, but receive a real, in case of doubt marketable equivalent, is the counter-speech.
Staiger's proposal to split the proposal accordingly finds three supporters.
For example, Stefan Haller summarizes the original programme with two votes against: "If we make the decision in this way, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: cyclists are thrown on the road
A 82-year-old cyclist was caught in a car crossing the road in Garath on Wednesday and was seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on his bike at 12:20 a.m. on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg road from Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the highway at the level of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove on the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the back traffic.
He crashed into a car driving a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital by a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich have to give up David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to leave the game against Dortmund.
With personal care, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing from the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The personal worries at the German football record-breaking champion Bayern Munich are increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 am/ZDF and Eurosport) at the cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alaba in the duel with BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
Also missing are the Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti blamed the physical condition and the imbalance in the game of his team.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn’t good last time.”
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently,” said Ancelotti, who expects a “difficult, intense game.”
The duel between the two German heavyweights attracts the fans.
The game is sold out with 81.360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking from star to star in the resin
In the resin, the first "star trail" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
Members want to set up signs along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-accessible installations at five to six locations" in Oberharz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegiß and Sieber were inquired.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Trek train will be expanded by train.
"On the stellar path, viewers will learn a lot about, for example, the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why one star was brighter than another, even though it was much further away.
It will also tell you what constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can often be seen clearly with the naked eye.
In the university city since 2003, at the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there is something similar to the planned stellar dwarf - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community of equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets – including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point – are positioned exactly at the distance and scale from one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is four kilometers.
While light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the star with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super springweight champion.
After Garcia’s victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday night at 7 p.m.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas remarked that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
“I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to arrange a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linachte-T.
"This fight could take place in the pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing himself openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready...”
Garcia said he values Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he may be attending his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia, saying that he thinks the three-match champion from Riverside "looks very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out".
Garcia said the focus was to show punch strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four wounded after tyre placement
Four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira at about 4.30 p.m. near the connection point Marketwide probably lost control of his vehicle after a tyre placement.
The car pulled to the right into the sidewalk, where it overshot itself and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident.
During the initial care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about an hour, after which traffic on the left lane at the accident site could be passed.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after the 2:2 start to the season against Braunschweig, the optimization of the defensive formation will bring Aue points.
With the first game of the season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, if it had not been for the two opposing goals at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two goals too many, and we have to look even better in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the three-chain chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the fortunes do not want to catch up anymore.
"For the future, it will be that no one will stand on the line beside Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in the preparation with the three-chain, his team will cope better than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players who can build well in the three-chain at the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and we don't allow ourselves to make so many playback mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"I don't know if we can talk about a failed start after a draw.
The performance could be quite okay,” said Hoffmann.
"But if we are on Sunday with four points and can focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn’t want to know.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage against Aue, just because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," Funkel said, and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher because they didn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in the bones.
“But they don’t know 100 percent where they are right now,” said Fortuna’s interior defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland as a light favorite go to the meeting on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away just because we have the right to get into the top six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," Fortunas head coach explains.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And that’s not how Funkel wants to see its players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They aim to make the age assessment more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was “possibly 18 years of age or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "possibly under the age of 18".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the past months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that “suggested that the person examined was 18 years of age or older.”
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that he would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t pretend we could,” he told Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case it is about 10 percent."
Full of Plan
Work on the three bridges on Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Construction at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Government Presidency in Freiburg.
In April, work on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach began simultaneously.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and easy is sure that the schedule is adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arched bridge clad in red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now entered the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fastener, which is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be deployed on Friday on the southern part of the bridge.
This is where the pedestrian trail will go.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipes through the construction in Lauterbach has required a special fingertip feeling.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
Residents were informed about the project by handsheets in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated one-track by a traffic light.
The road in the bridge area at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed for construction works on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance.
The cost of the three bridge renovations totals 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is funded by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull on a string, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.
The parties represented in the district of Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance, which on this day shows a peaceful flag, because the AfD invites Rondell to the poster according to the poster "big campaign start".
And brings well-known names to the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal parliamentary elections on September 24, and the deputy federal president Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the fountain square, but now it takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that is there.
And what Christa Karoli, chair of the Forum One World and one of the leading organizers, is rightly pleased: "It's great how many people have gathered here."
There is music and plenty of food, including a “German-made potato salad that the AfD could easily eat,” says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the train station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has endeavored for such an event and got the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built Laurentian skirmishes.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell Vorplatz, he says: "This is the right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
This is also what it does: Around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment in the city hall, several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal president, Beatrix von Storch, to deliver their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the courtyard have a longer breath, but also there is a short time to clean up after 9pm.
The police can take off - no special incidents.
Trombone Meets Trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli will take place in the Haslacher Klosterkonzerte series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or just "Balkan Folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in the wind music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpet player at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new outfit, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Nils Wogram, classics, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core part of the programme was launched in Freiburg this spring with great success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything,” says Kristen Stewart quite frankly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'"
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously.”
She suffered particularly from this, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, ‘Girl, be proud of you!’”
Especially to the public, she doesn’t like to explain her love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don’t like having to justify myself in front of the whole public.”
Governor of West Virginia Announces Change of Party
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in exultation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration with the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about 1.59 billion dollars.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying, "The change of party from Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather prevent us than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the latest rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message," said RNC chairwoman Ronna C. McDaniels in the statement.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated in the sport.
Russia’s head of athletics Dmitry Shyakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the banning of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regrets "all the athletes who were snatched away at gold and silver medals at competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found hints of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to re-introduce Russia," Coe said.
“We have to do everything we can in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for a re-establishment.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned trainers are still free, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
A mourning act for the soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a mourning ceremony in the northern Hessian town of Fritzlar, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) did not say anything about the still unexplained cause of the crash.
However, she described the two killed pilots as "experts in their field".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse were killed on Wednesday in West African Mali a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a bodyguard of the Bundeswehr to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At noon, only those in the church said goodbye.
After that, the mourning began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politicians.
Among them were Hesse’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm-in-arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarers and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in deployment.
The chief of staff had built up the flight operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belonged, declared: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the deployment is dangerous.
But it is also of great importance “for a country from which we are only separated by two states,” she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henry does not want a tomb next to his wife
The husband of Queen Margrethe of Denmark (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal family on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard had already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henry will be buried is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henry had never made a hint that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also took the title "Princess' Supper".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after his death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for for the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the French embassy on the Thames.
While his later wife always received the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy standing with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented on the first years in Denmark: “A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of knitting socks, Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation here as the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister wants swift re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony’s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a swift re-election of the Landtag after losing the red-green majority, but he does not want to resign.
On Friday, he called for the dissolution of the parliament.
Earlier, the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her Lower Saxony parliamentary group had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country’s parliamentary elections, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition of the CDU and the FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said in Hanover on Friday.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler would like to recommend that his group accept them.
The CDU and the FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, the SPD and the Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new state parliament is regularly elected on January 14th.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil believes, however, that it is essential that the Landtag decides on its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its next move on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament deprives the prime minister of confidence and elects a successor.
“Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be considered legally cleanly," Thümler said.
"You will be quietly discussing all questions if they are legally reasonably examined."
Tümler called Twesten's step "but something curious".
She said: “I am not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She described herself as a supporter of black and green.
The Greens urged the dismissed MPs to return their parliamentary mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she will return her parliamentary mandate, which she received via the green list of countries, with immediate effect," state presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner said.
Green group leader Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten".
It has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the Group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxony Green MPs Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treason to the voters, but also treason to the Red-Green," the Federal leader of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag quickly re-elected.
The exit of Twesten costs Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "puts her personal interests before the well-being of the country in her wounded vanity and in her frustration," SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticized.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue game and tries to beat political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony’s CDU faction leader Björn Thümler would like to recommend to his MPs that every Twesten be included in the CDU.
Thomas Oppermann, the SPD’s head of faction in the Bundestag, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 parliamentary elections with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answering in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states publish the latest information on the egg loads concerned.
The affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house immediately switched on and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of Germany’s concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and health-safe.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005 mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it’s not the companies’ fault.
Are producers and consumers on the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers.
Is it lacking only in personnel or also in the final responsibility?
After all, it was the official controls that revealed the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.
This is precisely why a consistent clarification of such incidents and the handing over to the prosecutors in cases where there may be criminal offences are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full enlightenment from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable foodstuffs.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Due to the armored means, manufacturers, traders and consumers have fallen into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-providing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This needs to be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the matter will be clarified quickly and without any gaps.
How Football’s Financial Rules Affect Neymar’s Move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organisation that oversaw the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money to get Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but have to counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from focusing on club debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003—buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand—was to become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And although Platini has been disgraced by the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to deter excessive spending.
“Of course, FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future,” Andrea Traverso, UEFA’s FFP manager, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the redemption amount for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG, along with Manchester City-owned Abu Dhabi, with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (then <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million – and it was ordered that team members for the 2014/15 Champions League season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies affiliated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of PSG’s payments to Neymar could come via payments from the World Cup 2022 organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not have any preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 made a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go, and they tried to prevent Neymar’s departure by claiming that PSG would injure the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schogg supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has produced board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to end: the airline is re-writing the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday at the request of the news agency.
According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-and-white-packed trays of 14 grams per year are distributed by the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to be 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect is always important: for a shoe manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey will endeavor to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate plates on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss entered into a contract with Migros’s daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with treats from the Sprüngli confectionery, in the Business Class naked passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributes Chocolate Frey on short distances, both in business and in the Economy Class.
Athletics - Diskus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, winner of the 2016 Olympics, had failed in the national World Cup and could only watch the discus competition from the tribune.
Also with the first attempt, Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the forerunners David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for Paul's g Ruhd to G, before their D Stars, like Elizabeth Am.
As a cultural artifact, it is a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken of by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening to the core of the gag – middle-aged actors playing horny children who will grow up – they nevertheless created the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more on the casting principle, including a riff on the 90s stalker films like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point, a character drifts through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates, and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The beloved Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, still has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there’s another insanely vicious plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the tours are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon's underlip beard from "Singles", whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could heat up this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I assume as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how it will make the film premiere of "Wet Hot American."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West ring-fight iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy directed by Rhys Thomas claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
With six long episodes, the comedy is not quick or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a shorter length, could deliver his agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make anything for a living.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own recent history and with their own.
Strike against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz reported on Friday.
Fifteen defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 have been arrested and warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.
In parallel raids in Italy, two people were arrested.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspected Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were on duty.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor’s Office in Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was an intense exchange between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, and Kripo Rottweil’s investigators had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations were aimed primarily at Italian nationals with a close connection to the Italian mafia.
An incident in Hüfingen on May 27, in which several shots were fired at a restaurant in the early morning, is also likely to go to the gang's account.
Wisely complains about large gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government’s Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreigners’ central register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "partly serious misdecisions" in asylum proceedings and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutschen Zeitung".
The register includes 10 million people of foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is thus managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "of people who have long been dead, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register".
“Incorrect data inputs can significantly slow down return processes,” the report said.
In addition, the statistics on people who are required to leave include EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
However, such false assignments led to "a distorted debate about how to deal with those who are required to leave", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently started sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy once they have arrived from there.
This is according to an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF is carrying out such procedures "with respect to families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - in Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, the EU member state is responsible for the refugees they reach first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that country may send him/her back to the country of entry.
For the reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokeswoman for the Left Party in the Bundestag, criticized the decision: “Families with children are threatening to be admitted because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system, which are in violation of human rights and a threat to the welfare of children.”
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Jürgen Greule, who with his 100 donations, shared 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the council, the community commends the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's brilliant how our bodies are designed for this and we owe respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, even unselfishly," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the canned food is being broken down into its components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that are being carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second-best result," said the DRK Circle Readiness Leader.
Apparently, the move to the theatre house a few years ago led to a higher number of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger accounted for half the number, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave away ten times 500 milliliters of their juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it maintains interest rates on family income amid increasing pressure.
The bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 percent, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that interest rate hikes would be necessary in the next few years to curb Brexit-induced inflation, and she said credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year after Brexit.
It will require time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding to banks starting in February, although it has been said that now it is expected to provide 15 billion more under this system – with 115 billion pounds.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on real incomes of households continues to burden consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "somewhat larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be made "gradually" and "limited".
The Bank’s downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% respectively, compared with the forecasts for May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision remains unchanged after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest rate increase and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases as the tightening gets worse first before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" income decline in the coming years, but she added that wages will "significantly" recover at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also being strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the interest rate cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank’s latest ruling on interest rates, the reputation for an interest rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said it was expected to do so and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess in relation to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are looking loudly for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages close, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular.”
NHS (National Health Service) to Prescribe Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 People
Patients will be given access to a “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-sex pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through an estimated first three-year study for 10,000 people.
He declared himself ready to fund the process after the Court of Appeals last year confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced Thursday was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants who agree to the study are identified, including men, women, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also apply for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an internationally competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of how it is used, incorporated and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in tackling one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority now must be that the study be conducted quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This experiment takes us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be conducted as quickly as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV, and that it will help us come a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the Great Life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It’s located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof of the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” says Joanne.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with an enclosed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my demand,” she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about making the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer room for all Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you’ll be selling the ground floor – or how your property is valued,” Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the land."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn from something standard to something quite amazing through good design and increased square footage.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers Fight for a $500 Million Real Estate Empire
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, arguing over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how his property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
The Westco Jeans family was founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Following an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court decree states that this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place on Friday after several failed mediations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business – of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicatessen stores from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their property to their sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke was paid $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained, although he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the TV star’s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and take our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in the hopes of keeping the head on a more uniform course.
Here is a quote from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that fell into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow—whether on paper or in briefings—because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he’s in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair reporting from positions that were convincing,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise award.”
- Okay. - Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we others don’t know – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn’t send.
If his employees managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - wholly concerned with this story - reported in May on the preference of the advisers to supply the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffened to find out where they come from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmaker added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter “tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump is getting.”
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are not known by nature, clues from the population are hoped for and asked for.
On Friday, Europol reported on the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" winter advent calendar.
Experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, Europol said.
We have compiled 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, it has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online visitors have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them on the basis of indications after publication on the website.
Travelers Negotiate a Trench and Return to the 'Millionaire Series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back on the brink of war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to claim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field off a prosperous Solihull road called the “Millionaire Series.”
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but were not deterred by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed Solihull's council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after being forwarded by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, since it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by giving long instruction to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can’t even stop it.”
A resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking lot."
A Council spokeswoman from Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside across Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls police to take the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenues were also lost by the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, given the dramatically increasing number of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the County Council Office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversy.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
At the time, the decision was not disputed in the city council.
Above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel site and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a three-star plus category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joy city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction scrap containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially demolished, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful citizens", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
A swimming pool, a spa area and a meeting room are also available.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated level in the city center, stresses Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be broad, Scherer further explains.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The views of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to set himself exactly.
It is less than a million euros, he said.
The external systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia case: US special investigator sets up Grand Jury
According to a report, Special Investigator Robert Mueller set up a so-called Grand Jury in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump.
The panel has started work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper valued the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN reported that the panel had already issued its first summons in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of having interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations is to be several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more scrutiny of Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Special Investigator Trump personally went into the center and investigated the allegation that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of the Grand Jury is to examine the available evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to bring charges.
Grand Jurys are also called indictment chambers.
They are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The panel can also be initiated by the public prosecutor’s office to summon persons for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, indictments have already been issued that revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Individuals who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign chief Paul Manafort were also present at the conversation.
Law experts said on U.S. television on Thursday night that the institution shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the filing of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russian history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats an opportunity to “feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about.”
Ty Cobb, his special adviser, said in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But it also usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House is in favour of any measures that would speed up the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he is not being investigated against the president.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement said.
Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this eviction, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to obstruct the justice system.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media reports, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his employees.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special enquirer such as in the Watergate affair of late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position where he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president’s urging.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday presented bills that would allow the special investigator to no longer be easily dismissed.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In Western Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the shelf.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
Over a trillion tons and 5,800 square kilometers, the colossus is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, the U.S. Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) writes in a background of facts.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was so far part of the Larsen-C shellfest.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows more and more into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C shellfish is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
To the north of this chaos, the balance of growth and breakdown was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete schelfeis has collapsed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C shellfish is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it currently is.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can break down if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea level, as it swims on the water and displaces ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shellfish causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could possibly raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen C shellfish is, according to AWI, the fourth largest shellfish in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down there regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more endangered position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings," he said.
Scientists are controversy over whether the Larsen-C shellfish will now grow again or fall back in the long run and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding, “Our models say it will be less stable.”
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades many of the Antarctic peninsula’s ice sheets have collapsed.
This long peak of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula’s ice sheet has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature rise has contributed to the decrease.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants house rate with staff
As it becomes more and more difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag has opened 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
Apparently, the teaching positions at the circle are very coveted.
Around 620 applications were to be registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann district.
Doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are being sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the parties' request, the administration will develop "a concept for the recruitment and development of personnel".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but also to address the shortage of applicants in a forward-looking manner.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards, show concrete measures for cross-initiators and include a training offensive, CDU, FDP and UWG demand.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.
Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real “competition of public employers”.
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to take action so that no more jobs remain vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Völkers, the CDU’s group leader, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
Recently, he caused a big surprise in the district district, when he publicly questioned the staff cost coverage and amazed the other parties.
Peoples want all the possibilities that make it possible to leave the local employers’ association to be checked.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district cities - should aim for a house tariff," Völkers said.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the Public Service Tariff Regulation actually provides.
Wages are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Last but not least, due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens tone for NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs deploying rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organisation Youth Rescue because its crew had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human lives is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement to social media.
"We can only assess any accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rescued', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew is taking on board hose boat migrants delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of being overseen by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must primarily have on board an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring about "substantial changes or impediments" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperate with local mayors had been fruitful.
"In the last few days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Rises and Trials
Neun Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the northern Pfalz to enjoy trials and sightseeing for four days.
For this purpose, three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burg- und Weinfest von Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were longer and longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, point of view lined up with point of view, connected by "flowing" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, there have been many altitudes.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled healing sole in the open air inhaler.
Neustadt was also promoted.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sportively and culturally.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sport
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the wind and weather fighting over the stadium grasses?
The fact is: eSports has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business – big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges included.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this field.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and VfB Stuttgart, which founded an eSports department in mid-July and hired two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire completely new target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that “there will still be a number of clubs on this train.”
This weekend, FIFA is organizing the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where players from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
“The real football has to deal in particular with the 14- to 30-year-olds, so that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future,” says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportlers under contract, you could be online much more often in these markets than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the FIFA football simulation are contested at a competitive level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, eSports is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly accustomed.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and a quick responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the nutrition.
“The good player is a good player.”
But Frobiese also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to execute in online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were lacking.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, it’s like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the company consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros were thus implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
That’s not much compared to the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football league.
However, e-sports “is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” write the Deloitte advisors.
Many countries are already international.
Major markets are Asia and the United States, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is a lot going on in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the football league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
"In the European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia alone, and to explain the old days, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt said.
"You can't hold on to the fact that football is the only thing that keeps everything the way it always has been."
Gift-Egg ade - The Egg Alternatives for Cooking and Baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the toxic egg scandal.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter Condemned for Conrad Roy's Suicide Texts
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the negligent murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with his hands folded, and his eyes pointed downwards when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own better.
She has not assumed any responsibility,” she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that they utterly regret.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he had not found out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness had a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said that "there is no day I don't mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything, and I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she would be "stalked" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
“No longer having this one person I’ve been with every day since birth is a pain I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump off a building, punch yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Roy’s death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern’s new mini-lahm
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to compete as captain in the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern has a great season for the Confed-Cup winner - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer, he stopped at his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner said after his first appearance as Bayern's captain.
Well, the standoff could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich in this way.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the leader of the C-Eleven in the youth players, debutants and professionals just coming from the holidays, but he.
You prefer to distribute sugar to those who you trust a lot, who you want to keep up with the mood.
So those who have been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: to take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flickered over the field as a mini-lamb.
Right back, this is now his position, the white tie on her arm did the rest.
And in general, Kimmich worked in this starting formation as the one who can best take the rudder in hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed troop.
He looked at the whole thing while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (it hardly worked); Renato Sanches by coming out to the devil to tie the achievements of the Asia trip (it worked only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle by not showing up negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, it worked very well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy stood up before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The famously occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, in addition, Süle also tried successfully in the construction of the game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not as we hoped".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "For this style, I was also brought."
As unusual as this Bayern world is for the new entrants, it was seen after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crippling statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game."
After all, he doesn’t have to teach the new ones anymore.
Alaba motivates <0xC3><0x96>FB-Ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our <0xC3><0x96>FB-Ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer reported via Twitter shortly before the game and wished the <0xC3><0x96>FB-Ladies all the best.
The Bavaria Legionary is almost a club colleague of <0xC3><0x96>FB-Kapitän Schnaderbeck and is feverish with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational syringe.
Perhaps our ladies need the famous Bavaria gasoline.
Business satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It often turned out to be irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the economic minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This comes after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy at T V’s request – and at the same time taunting the former minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing is grappling with the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has blocked all of them."
Natus sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy: the closure of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan-setting procedure, the construction law is expected to be in place by 2021.
A role in the country’s plans is also played by the West bypass of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Roadmap.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a waypoint to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as encouraged by Wissing, aims to establish a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Chamber of Crafts in Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1000 for the master’s exam and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2500 is provided if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master’s training.
The homework list for the country, however, remains long.
In the planned road construction, the facts are quickly created, but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the state-owned mobility company, only 29 have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU factional vice-president Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The broadband expansion in the country so far is also disconcerting.
In 2016, regional companies rated the network supply in an IHK survey only with a score of 3.4.
They complained about stagnant Internet connections and disruptions.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of disagreement, they already cleared the field again.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles – car manufacturers face a backlash
A day before the announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the move as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of smearing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but go back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi’s engine development in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request that focused on the United States was expanded.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could put a heavy strain on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is contributing disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a raft will pass through Munich on Saturday morning, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not the usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a mountain of rubbish.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the Isar is meant to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wildflower.
Already last summer the raft crossed the Isar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's tuber nose and laughing at the suffering
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoonists, the tuber noses of his characters are his trademark.
At the age of 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 in Buenos Aires, Spain.
In his early years as an artist, he worked as a cartoonist for greeting cards, which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job,” he once said.
After stationing in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Slender Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his sloppy figures continue to find widespread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand footer as its counterpart.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is set to hit the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s strange to me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That’s why he’s more focused on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-transmitting insects, causing scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions to severe headaches.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only attractive for vacationers, it is also in high demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
This year the town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhine celebrates its 1200th anniversary.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Creepers, tanneries, dealers, vagabonds or a landsknechtslager are supposed to be experienced in the city center these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of Riodoce Weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: take their children to the office, which were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government’s payroll or the cartel, a catalog of criminals that make Mexico’s chaos dangerous.
There is no break from the violence, and as the bodies pile up across the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her publisher and her Riodoce inspiration, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear type Panamanian t-shirts with his face or smiling face.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the murders of journalists are seldom brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
“Until we know why, we distrust everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions battle here to fill the void.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot in the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "quiet" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
Initially, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members purchased each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters loved publishing hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories no one else dared deal with.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa “is a way of life,” he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“You have to take on the task that you have to do as a journalist – either that or you’re playing the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why haven’t you told me what was going on?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a harbor worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
He trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine ruined?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do their job while remaining alive.
"They don't like it when you're dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust in your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "Smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Days earlier, it was announced that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was being used for the surveillance of journalists and activists in Mexico, and that they were not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees met for security training.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40°C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half joking, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of policemen whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It’s been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s issue, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a State Expenditure Exposure focusing on the Governor's hometown.
And there was a group carrying out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels for almost a century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been charged with high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Just a few months earlier, readers had seen the Valdez column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
“We would have known what happened before,” Villarreal, 46, nicknamed “El Flaco” because of his slim body.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been rededicated as a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists because employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist at the prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington, D.C., trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
She has since asked to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were “surrounded” by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who are undercover with organized crime.
The "Article 19" media watchdog group attributed more than half of the attacks to police journalists and officials last year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut,” Ramirez said.
Apparently, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “Here I am because of my reports.”
A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside her detached head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do what El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, apparently by photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who lag behind and continue to work, it’s a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already over, Riodoce’s editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office drinking beer when all of a sudden their phones began to ring.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the edge of the border, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens roared in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who were guarding to see if they were in readiness.
If they were scared at all, they didn’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the newspaper’s fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they could even find out that her scaly skin was of reddish brown – and they said she had had something of a “unrestful past.”
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurian that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as “really remarkable.”
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant-eater, although covered in armor and resembling a wandering tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its environment and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor across his body.
They discovered the counter-shadow, a widespread method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the creature's tip was darker than its underside.
Although counter-shadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shadow — think of deer, zebras, or belt animals — are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaurian was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaur predators must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans were probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurian is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just peel your eyes a little, you could almost believe that he's asleep."
Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, permeated the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long on average and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that protruded from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was flooded through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The rocky remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hawks still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remnants of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the animal’s skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
In the storm: Mass Karambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car accident.
There are numerous injured, kilometre-long congestion - and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass car accident in the late afternoon of Thursday.
According to the first information of the police, around 5 p.m. between the connection points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a storm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were interlocked.
There was no information about the exact number of people injured.
These are mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of travel Munich formed a backstairs about ten kilometers long.
As one AZ-Reporter reports, there were also massive handicaps on the opposite lane - through numerous gaffers.
The firefighters took note of the license plates of the drivers, who now face sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 there was a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a truck and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the crash site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: you’re sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you are deep into your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: puff.
If the creator comes and wakes up an unpleasant or tears the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the schaffnerless ticket control.
You can simply confirm by phone that you have taken your seat and devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
“When the offer arrives, let’s expand it.
It is then expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany," a railway spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" refers to the ticket evaluation without a drawer.
To be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do anyway.
You also need to have bought it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My tickets".
For the test customers, an electronic devaluation button appears.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at the ticket checkpoint, he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket already devalued.
So you can sleep, work, keep quiet.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"Those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants simply check in in the DB Navigator themselves.
This allows passengers to make their journey time on the train more personal,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest inconveniences.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or ID card is missing or a document that must be presented.
The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling your own ticket, and the creator eventually takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis-born woman was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
“Police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the street,” it said.
Confused because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The St. Louis area rapper was tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped off her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police gang and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown’s father, who carried a sign that read, “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unfurled his rifle and yelled, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"That's not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
“This is not the kind of murder that we’ve become accustomed to and that we can call typical.”
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, Whose Streets?, in the cinemas from the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, which consists of the views of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition".
“Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?” she recalled what she said.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t right.
I couldn’t take them with me,” Ferrell later said.
“What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also knowing the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to become free in order to liberate ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn’t personally experience blatant racism, she’s no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I would do her a bad service to keep her away."
The first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station that became a campground as activists awaited the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter teamed up with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism has totally changed since August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to “document” what happened.
One question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can take advantage of?”
This skepticism was nurtured by countless cases of people, often whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, “We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn’t have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already collaborated with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
Ferrell's involvement brought the project closer, along with six other locals followed the "Whose Streets?" team in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. We're talking," Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, because that’s how I’m going to be portrayed.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – to show that the movement “is not a Messiah leader, but a community coming together,” Folayan said – she turned out to be the film’s most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to remark that "the movement is really being sustained by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person who stirred up this energy,” she said.
“It’s no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront, because living at these crossroads as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A chaos".
Still, she clings to a song and feels obliged to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "Dream" to "Grand Madness": TV Readers Discuss Bit Gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it hasn’t been built yet.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold hardly leaves the subject.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really cool" (Nichole Schausten), on the other hand: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Großenwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While advocates are building on one gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the businesses, opponents fear the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the Bauernmarkthalle stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work will be finished.
The gallery creators want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely towards the Beda square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the Bauernmarkthalle for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farmers again and again very much liked.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities, there are also.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But it shouldn’t be too low on the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothes, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of this in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, stores in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are hardly any specialty stores and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
First of all, where should the farmers’ market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost Bit-Galerie manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg beforehand?"
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery.
But there is no more room for a farmer’s market hall thanks to the insanely many – as I find – pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the peasant market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A matching resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces – white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly similar – hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tops and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clips from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she released classified diplomatic messages via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Similarity.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he was only three days in office.
Through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, what someone with these genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has made a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data – the many ways they can be interpreted but also on the inherent identity of this determinism.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Throughout the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo—a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting in a driver’s seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig—with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg told a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t be visited at that time and she couldn’t be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which the president would transform Chelsea's verdict and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release only a few days after the book was published after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy reunion.
There is something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, too, as Donald Trump wages a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further ignite the rigid divides he is supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the gallery wall, Manning, with her oversized signature below it (the "i" in her family name is given a heart), called for an end to "automatic splitting based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s advanced scientific dictionary) how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"What people hopefully will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a private room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic book.
She shows Manning appearing with a hands-free phone in hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they cool your speech, they've won," it says.
"So never shut your mouth".
“It came directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist, who greets her from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person – as foreshadowed in the comic book – but if she should do so, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres, cramming together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2>2, Manning’s stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were given arrest warrants for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stings as a murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now on leave and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A University and Somerville College spokesperson said in an email statement that "we are in touch with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way imaginable."
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were helping to locate the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: “Police are currently working on the victim’s timeline and background and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
"We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to be implemented.
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap on compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for re-establishing RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted to a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won’t admit something that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In a conversation with the Russian sales outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the WADA doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be deployed again.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was reported by the corporate groups.
It was a mere precautionary measure and could not be further assumed to be a health impairment, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs to be delivered to Aldi, which have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-foaming agent.
Aldi wants to bring clarity and transparency to its customers.
The Start-Ups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure her employee’s happiness with your e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or – worse – fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There just never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of HR start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to go directly to management and allow them to seek advice from F-Sühr C.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it provides a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results – so you can drill down to why.
Companies are coming to realize that you need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don’t become the next Uber to be involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let’s Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber fall in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “pulse” surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has caught up with the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices – can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the “social media to get to their right” that companies realized they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitteren secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making that company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If the third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, they may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change isn’t coming fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you’re asking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be willing to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies rely too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t follow, employees will ask themselves, ‘Have you really heard me?
Are you taking care of that?
And whoever you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a glint issue is reported, Resett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise multiple teams within the company and add communication training to address the problems due to the speed of decision making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee engagement in an industry known for high turnover.
“If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
“When you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It happens at 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have undressed their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days – at least until the final on Friday.
That’s why UCLA’s first three trainings should start at 7:15 p.m. to meet players’ already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and conducted practical exercises during summer school for the first time during Moras’s six seasons in Westwood.
They are expected to hold 18 drills during August 20 before the formal game preparations for their opening game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA’s rule change, even if it added another point to the players’ busy routes.
“We put this enormous strain on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
“And they just pushed it through, they keep sticking, they’re great people.
I think as soon as we get there by Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been thrown with footballs clearing a protective net behind a gate post.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
“This is a real problem, and it’s not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then set themselves up there to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact-checkers who may display the results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories ahead of the May presidential election, and Germany supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly sideline hateful posts as before the September election.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-check was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to realizing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “linked article” and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its more recent past, the little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a slippery slope for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mocking Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
“I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says sadly.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote 2014’s Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter so written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because then a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he is also there.
I love the archives!”
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overestimated my welcome"), this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
Scotney’s intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when her last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just starting to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the attic."
Diary books, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch for which the two families fought.
Guys, let it all go its way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
“There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380 in this book titled ‘Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex’,” says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
“Maybe the two are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, constantly indebted and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women – I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise insiders.”
After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Eleämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old chapel in Rhöndorf concealed
With the cover-up of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new rooftop brand (Thursday's tour).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwert as a highlight of the campaign.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or?" ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel.
“We (of course!) don’t really think that,” they write on their unlocked website yesterday.
“But we’re using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is more than just a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable single-mindedness feature".
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
For an average of five digits, the city of Bad Honnef can taste its new brand and campaign.
Turkey's military reforms - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on retirements and promotions in the Corps of Officers.
So too this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
Under the chairmanship of the head of government, the five deputy prime ministers and the ministers of defence, interior, justice and foreign affairs took part in the discussions.
The civilians in the YAS were thus in overcrowding.
The government is pulling the strings in the military.
Chief of General Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, air force and navy have been dismissed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army – mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the wire puller of the coup attempt.
Around 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being negotiated in Ankara this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempted overthrow a “God’s gift” because it gave him the opportunity to “completely cleanse” the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discomfort in the military headquarters".
There are concerns in the general staff about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the great cleansing of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered the firing of 7,395 other civil servants, including 2,303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were once considered to be the real masters of the country.
Three times they purged, citing their role as guardians of the worldly order.
After his 2002 election victory, Erdogan pushed back the military’s power step by step, not least in reference to the reform agenda of the European Union.
Former officials say Erdogan is deliberately pushing for the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that were the case, NATO could not be left cold.
After all, there are doubts in the Alliance about the willingness of the Turkish army to intervene after the cleansing.
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington Changes the Rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, cited by the media.
It plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tighter visa requirements for temporary work permits, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States is issuing green cards to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
“This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to renovate route for racing shuttle
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of controversy about the future of the racing shuttle - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the maroden route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the route will begin this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this connection, which is especially important for tourism," said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country took over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalized, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as the operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"This negotiates the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the racetrack shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular train connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations.
In the past few months, it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route is being used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also very constructive in parts.
The Rise of Sex Robots Is Real, and We Should Worry
Just as you thought it couldn’t get any more crazy in 2017, a new report is coming up on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its nipple shape and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of it, and we’ll get to see them even more often,” Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more troubling as many robots possess the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as personal to your personality as possible,” the True Companion website says.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixed on conversation, or she may be “in the mood!”
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots—not least because they replace real human relationships—but the submissive female traits, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step towards Frigid (called here: repulsive) Farrah, disturb one the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap that these highly-developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women’s rights around the world are under threat, when there is a president in the White House who boasts of sexually assaulting women.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Maid') is not the graphic images, the engulfed bodies and the eyelashes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point when it comes to their “personalities,” the robots don’t represent real women.
You can’t separate yourself from your companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: Maids
Trump's great achievement?
He Makes Mitt Romney the Meaning of Common Sense
It has become an insider’s wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-electing relatives.
We're all supposed to be tightening up to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less has been noticed about Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she has struggled with for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite oddly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in another context that this also involves significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the derogatory effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the frightening possibility that his peers will one day no longer repulse us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be inconsistent with his standards.
Today, I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the insane – the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which in fact occur as a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the Republicans’ next candidate will only have to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are enormously tall, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals twist to look frightened over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite through the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage – the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub doesn’t count – but a large roundabout in northern London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to rate my “experience” with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull my credit card through.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is needed.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologeticly smiling while I was tired of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet booth in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to impose this time against Pistorius Appell’s six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Enforcement Agency said it would raise an objection to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When the farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released for the holidays and into the secondary schools.
Three of the high school students will go to high school in the future, four to the real school.
On Tuesday evening, school principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and public representatives at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.
The 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm and was released.
In addition, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and made it hatch from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of it broke, the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and escaped.
Afterwards, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank’s first year.
The hens danced with the young goggles who wore cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chickens), but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he would feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by thanks to the colleagues, the former head of school Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in at lesson shortages, and the parents’ representatives.
Chicken time is now over, said Sophia Schumacher, a class teacher.
She dismissed her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
In conclusion, all the students sang a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
For the new school year, eight first graders are already enrolled.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, citing television.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally tenting people, including the two Bulgarians, was arrested by police in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day, while an investigation is currently underway.
The foreign ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and are imposing significant fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Affected People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They aim to improve the exhaust gas performance of cars in the Euro 5 and Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded from this.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives ratings:
Is the new policy compulsory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have sponge software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Vehicle Administration (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months, but have not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler has told us to write to everyone concerned.
If an inspection is required anyway, it will be done within their framework.
How long will the renovations take overall?
"It's hard to say," Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the issue of the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It can be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably would imitate foreign manufacturers, according to Smetanin.
Is the price of Euro 4 cars in danger of falling?
The ACE fears that.
But especially in regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also include singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographers Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The winner of the progressive TV series, Lear, has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He told the New York Times: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s city planner, is retiring next year.
The job is already open - suitable applicants are, however, rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him a lot of fun, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
In this way, taking into account the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for incorporation.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present the corresponding certificates.
The city definitely wants to keep this function.
If they were no longer able to fill them out, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports on a good operating climate and a good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the redevelopment of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz are about to be initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the renovation of the stadium is still a topic.
The latter alone will hit the beech with around 1.5 million euros, “if we do it right,” estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun.”
There is a lot of room for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own building and gardening, it is possible to react fairly flexibly to many things.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, stresses the outgoing city builder.
After all, the city’s builder bears a high responsibility.
He is the builder, "in the end, everything here runs over my table."
He can count on long-standing employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (high construction) has been with him for ten years, and Manfred Schöner (deep construction) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor stays long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the job and wants to stay."
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to demonstrate a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building regulations and planning law.
The City Planning Office is responsible for construction and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, management of the urban properties, the City Business Court with the building yard and gardening company, as well as the Lower Building Law Authority, including the protection of monuments.
Bicycle thrown on wires: South railway line blocked
According to police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators assume two male offenders and have been looking for them for the night.
Witnesses had observed a pink-red scooter and a bicycle rider near the scene of the crime.
“This goes far beyond a blast,” <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put the train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of the rail replacement traffic, panels of railway customers could also reach the perpetrators.
Overall, it is assumed to be a "significant" amount, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried without impediments.
Nearly ten passenger trains failed on Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not run out, but they were late.
According to <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of cables had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (Inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable condition, affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the equilibrium tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environments, even if the same system works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice — the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequencinged and six bacterial species were found present in the mice with the immune cells but missing them in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea’s <0xC2><0xA3>40m signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira pre-marched at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' Asia Prep Tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve put a lot of effort into it.”
Boeing "painted" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the US, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was to be the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a stamina test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
Thus, the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked at Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no fires from the party headquarters, just no counter-wind from the confederation - that was the main wish of the electoral campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching with growing horror the events in the SPD-run state capitals.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
They were deep hits.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the parliamentary elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The Greens-Bundesmanager Michael Kellner has called on the renegade Lower Saxon Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the voters.
Every Twesten must immediately return their mandate," the Federal CEO and campaign manager of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true at all," a SPD campaigner sighed when the new Jobs message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands there after the transfer of the Green MPs Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority.
It is the provisional climax of a whole series of major and minor crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the comrades of the time.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
Then it got worse - and it got worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tumult, the Düsseldorf-Pleite smoothly killed the party.
The comrades reappeared in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbe Philharmonic while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication after that, he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
And now for Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas issue and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been criticized for a long time.
There were some misunderstandings added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been increasingly trying to put accents in the Bundestag in the past few weeks.
The attempt of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden from comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to grant it, because they promised to stabilize the party of Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, Weil is basically not to blame for the internal party quarrel of the Lower Saxon Greens.
And not Schulz at all.
In the meantime, the comrades try to keep their ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially at the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratic how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left in the SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms Twesten has not been elected to parliament because of her personality as a direct candidate, but through the country list of the Lower Saxon Greens, the Lower Saxon MP continued.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the federal parliamentary elections, to the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He called for an explanation of the background.
I want to know if there have been more or there have been further commitments of the CDU Lower Saxony.
Subsidies for local centres III
Those who want to renovate their home in the years to come will soon be able to receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back at what had happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been renovation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is important, after all, to promote interior development as well, and not just to open up new construction sites.
On April 4th, the Karlsruhe Presidency of the Government informed us that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounts to 833,333 euros, of which 500,000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a renovation area created?
We will continue to investigate, Schindler said, where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in renovating in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be relocated.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal program "Social City", within the framework of which the renovations would then be carried out.
At the heart of the program are the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions, and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, i.e. per plot.
The rehabilitation area would then be determined as a statute.
The grant period for the grants runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the inventory would be carried out only once, within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to be completed.
In November or December, if possible, the statutory decision should be made so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing the urban deficiencies and deciding when to renovate and to what extent.
A renovation note will then be entered in the land register for the respective land.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Buildings and Plots", which deals, among other things, with the building condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and Housing" can be given information about the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living space.
The blue "operating sheet" is to be filled only when the building is operating business premises.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds works according to the "windhund principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can not "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Local Core II" were shown to make a renovation "tasteful" to the attendees.
British inventor puts himself a microchip to get in the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is performed according to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra cost of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event highlighting U.S. manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military, which was handed over to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote to his superior, the deputy naval aviation commander, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17 at around 7 a.m., and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft for the time being.
From the records provided to TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
“One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a boost to the health care reform that was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' show - showing products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to depose the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted on the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said the taxpayers did not take over the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exposing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the U.S. Department of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
“Determining the costs for taxpayers based on the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I expect hundreds, if not thousands of people to depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this.”
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss in front of a tricky task
The leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga joins the third-placed Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the third-placed Searchdorfer SV.
Despite five matches still flawless balance, the top runner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has a lot of respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a fairly similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I find the team very good.”
The class and stability of the Suchsdorfer SV are mainly ensured by imports from the high north.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to Davis Cup stakes.
And they are also strong in doubles,” says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's going to be hard for us, as always.
You also need a good portion of happiness.”
The Neusser team for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue-White could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman who is still active in the Challenger Tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays in the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first bet this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still on the ball yesterday with Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club on the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also get back into the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills the squad.
How America Can Harm the OMV
Truly happy, Donald Trump did not appear to have signed on Wednesday night under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his haste to pass the law," Congress had wrapped in some "unconstitutional regulations," he grumbled.
Even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed at the US advance.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the domestic OMV, which together with other European companies co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have since been concerned.
The threat scene is huge.
However, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are available for him to choose from.
"The press" has looked at which ones the group could resist and which ones could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the focus of Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which unveils Pablo Escobar’s killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen assistants
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban children's day care centers, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban children’s day care facilities (Kitas) again in its own hands.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the department of youth assistance, this is good news: "We were all very pleased".
Cooking continues outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled food.
The city operates 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, while 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the last Kita year, 2,800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
“In the meantime, it’s not just children who are cared for forty-five hours who eat at the kita at lunchtime,” Pomeranz explains.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from September 1st: they heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, spend the food, clean off, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," Pomeranz says.
The size - there are two-group facilities as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the hour scope.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the kita team," says Pomeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for kita management to implement pedagogical concepts".
Because that’s what it’s all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"Let the children help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
Continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance, also the charm that it has proved to be the most economical for the city in the cost comparison between owning and externalizing, according to the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours are not so heavy for about 750 people in the educational field," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run for office in the provincial council elections. Three women are running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unrestrictedly and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential election will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat to a consultative role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be peacefully handed over by a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
Walk to the TV Anniversary

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, reportedly attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old girl, who was staying with friends on Kolping Street, around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to make a phone call with the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's phone and necklace, but failed.
Without any prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are underway.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company has been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be “the first to know” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "express concern that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be advanced".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, in the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “Tollcross’s Head of Branch received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued engagement with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure business environment, we are continuously reviewing our business – and this applies to all of our business areas and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and should our operations at the site change, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga page may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in its pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record assault?
The sensational approach has boosted the transfer window this summer as the Ligue 1 club is set to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After his retirement, Neymar became the world’s most expensive player and the world’s highest-paid professional athlete. PSG offers salaries of over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted one of PSG's best players to sign.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, it will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers to Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately tossed a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus inflicted damage of more than 200 euros on the veil of the vehicle.
The Schramberg police, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for directions.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because he was hit by a car on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touched the dashboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming towards Leese at around 19:55.
In the area around the town of Stolzenau, he was met by a car on his lane, so he had to evade to the right.
The Touran driver touched the dashboard.
The car caused damage to Sachsen.
The driver of the arriving car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his drive without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the injured person, it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
The police are now requesting witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau at tel. 05761/92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann thinks.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to sustain discussions.
Christian Weisner, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche", told the German news agency that he expects the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus pope, to be blamed.
It would be very useful for the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their then erroneous assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized that when reporting on violence at the cathedral squares, it was measured with "two measures".
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "ugly and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
“The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to church and that's a found meal."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "strokes were a very normal educational means" to "get along with naughty children, as I was one".
They found it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared.
Completely wrong, thinks author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the remembrance band "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, enlightened by the Diocese of Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedrals were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 cathedrals.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases, the cathedral master R. used forms of physical and mental violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories are associated with him.
In the interview, Hesemann explains why he believes the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves him.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against guards at the Regensburg cathedral spats" gives a contradictory picture of cathedral master Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholericist and perfectionist, who often became handy when a Domspatz musically brought no top performance.
How do you, as his biographer, assess this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort to read the entire 440-page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger even occurs in it.
Eight pages have been dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of being an accomplice or an accomplice in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violence in the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
You can blame him for being too late to know about it or for not taking the first hints seriously enough.
The cathedral gymnasium where he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "rescue", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger gives a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted", "loved", "delicious", "competent" and "comprehensive", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies from Traumer.
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has also led to outbursts of anger.
Not only did he knock on chairs and throw the keychain on the floor, but he also distributed earrings and pulled too naughty guys to his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
However, to save his honor, it must be said that such methods of upbringing were widely used in the 1960s and 1970s, both by parents and teachers.
Do you also know such methods of breeding?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is really about, namely, the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are, of course, trivialities.
One wonders if it has to do with his acquaintance and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.
Indeed, many who have never understood the Bavarian Pope are still eagerly working out.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
Much has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly not.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have confided in the cathedral chapel master.
Not even the parents were consecrated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one person, deputy for the others, "it was very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and still is that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choirmaster who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger’s role in relation to the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student interviewed put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is ... also really absurd to assume that, in the end, it was him ... Boobs were more intrusive or clearer or more open than to their parents, boarding school managers, trust teachers, etc.
Talking to him about sex is unthinkable.”
The report concludes: “The fact that students and/or their surroundings had previously been entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation.”
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be acquitted of any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented or brought him to trial.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these abominable crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "excessive violence" was read at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mixture of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
This, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: between the preschool and the high school of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let’s say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choirmaster of the cathedral.
The whole horrific bullying pedagogy, the cases in which boys were harassed and mistreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all happened in the kindergarten in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he did not see the boys until they were already in the cathedral spat gymnasium.
On that was, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" taboo.
One was just happy to be her escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And the same is true of Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories are associated with him".
At the very least, the blame remains for having looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was informed of the conditions in the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear anything about the events at a school where he was just not working and was responsible (so the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to him that "in preschool, the punishment of beatings continues to be practiced".
Already in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were also long banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal gray area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the victims might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can’t say that he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the ban on punching schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the “falltrick of anachronism”, that is, the danger of judging the past by today’s moral standards.
The princess is right.
But of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to what was perpetrated in preschool against rebellions and violence against innocent children’s souls, which goes far beyond what was then customary.
It’s awful and I’m glad it’s finally working out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e., to pull on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of punishment also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, the cathedrals played only a secondary role.
However, I do not deny that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for absolute discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form a world-class institution out of the previously nationally known Regensburg Cathedral Squares, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which had toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1987).
With biscuits and candy alone, one does not make reluctant boys great singers and stands before every success, no matter what the field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about his book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heartfelt people who you can not imagine that he could do anything to hurt even a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former cathedrals still keep in touch with him today, 23 years after his emeritus, regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of his family.
Those who have not forgiven him to this day that he was once strict with them are thus clearly in the minority.
Most cathedrals today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music closer to them.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but he was also a loving respected person, whom they still look up to today and whom they almost revere.
And please, once again very clearly: all that is being accused of are the methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be happy that we have already overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, the media sin goat.
There is only too obvious the evil intention behind it.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would command a 93-year-old man, who has acquired great merits and without the outsiders of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, probably no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen, to finally be left in peace.
