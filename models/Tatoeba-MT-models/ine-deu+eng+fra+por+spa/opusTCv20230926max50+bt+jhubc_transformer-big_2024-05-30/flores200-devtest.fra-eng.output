The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC (Olympic Committee of the United States) that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of proportion so courageously described by Larry Nassar’s survivors could go unnoticed for so long and adopts any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and accountable environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown brown on the top and pale in color or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also makes it possible to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called rachis, but nevertheless show other characteristics specific to feathers – beards and beards – the researchers inferred that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development later on to these other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feathering rather than the duvet of a chick.
Scientists say this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A car blew up at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged Daesh (IS) activist as the suspect in the attack.
They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as the other stars. The activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the number of Rossbys of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
In terms of magnetic inversions, the smaller the number of Rossbys, the less active the star is.

He added that "they should not be asked to assume obligations that go beyond their development stage, their responsibility and their capabilities."
The Study Group on Iraq presented its report today at 12 a.m. GMT.
He warns that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this stage will end sectarian war, increasing violence, or slipping into chaos.
The report opens with a call for an open debate and a consensus in the United States on Middle East policy.
The report is very critical of almost all aspects of the current government's policy towards Iraq and strongly advocates an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts traction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

Infrared images reveal, given the temperature variations during the day and at night, that these are probably caves.
“They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.”
“Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the planet’s large caves that maintain a constant temperature, but they resemble in that they are deep holes in the earth,” said Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS crew and staff at the Northeastern University of Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the agents have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the urn and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, the votes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except those of duly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each step of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in tenth place in the group of seated women with a combined time of 4:41.30, or 2:11.60 minutes less than Austrian Claudia Loesch, who arrived first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who arrived ninth.
In the women’s seated ski category, four skiers failed to finish their course; in the case of giant slalom, 45 out of 117 skiers in this race failed to qualify.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people for violating the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop.”
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants had their faces hidden when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured.
However, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow the emergency services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court Court in Edinburgh.
She is in custody pending her review and trial, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised as her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from Dundee University, notes that “journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told reporters that no further comments will be made until at least the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents to a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional parasite control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS' interim conservation and heritage manager, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly yesterday inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a set of measures to engage the country on the path of new elections.
This commission was Martelly’s response to the vast anti-regime protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as “non-serious.”
The ministry said it was “really regrettable” that Apple had postponed the report.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six of them have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Philippine photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He received training as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his spare time.
Her research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the baby’s lung maturation.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two months. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... even more... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election found that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of respondents think Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was not able to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, as these are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime number to date.
Several people checked the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply for Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as “political gossip and nonsense.”
He is expected to appear for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, not on previously used ground-based radar systems, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more detailed information to pilots.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and relay parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport has created the possibility that the match can be played in private, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process has been estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin pinstripe, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant conic-beaked pinstripe, Geostrios cone.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be pulled into fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued on another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a water hose in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were side by side.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest advantage it has brought us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are more medium-sized felines that eat also medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-range companion cats) that eat small, much more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lions.
Women are usually very close to each other, their family being composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump from great distances and tread with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones able to roar.
The roaring of the tiger does not resemble the roaring of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be screams and groanings.
Ocelots are lovers of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find animals to eat (preys) by smell, sniffing their path on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also travel very stealthily. Ocelots track their prey by merging into their environment before throwing themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves above a mountain or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one in which it was.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, it always needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process “specification”, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. expire).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosaic was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosaics.
His long jaws were endowed with more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had his tongue folded, his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosaics, and he may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not sized against him.
Although the Romans consumed the food we know of, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and lory, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they rested on the side while they ate their meal.
Ancient Roman meals could not include those foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the home of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggourats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Jewish family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street; the houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and named it so — while traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the Benjamin Gates movie and the Treasure of the Templars, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776" could be read. The text is located at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the rating was simply added as a label.
The J-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civilis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it refers.
Cities-States are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, often not cooperative, to enforce all its acts.
It also had no power to derogate from tax laws or customs duties between States.
The articles required unanimous consent from all States before they could be amended, and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second-highest-ranking team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make it up, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing by mentioned it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the surrounding buildings of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the era of analog films.
It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the photo sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, and it's pretty confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, family of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which has been heavily mistreated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that creates dynamism while providing image protection.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the roturier.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder if this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain set up a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime zones, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic only provoked a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its limitless underwater warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a propensity for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation repeating in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different epochs; each stage of China or every family in power was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable age of divided provinces, the best known of these periods being the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place among many members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Chinese Antiquity. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the scope of this worldly life, and used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. When you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
Above, you can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very little from this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The plateau of Giza, or "necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khoops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives as well as members of his family.
The “push” symbol resembles a V and the “pull” symbol resembles a staple or square whose bottom side is missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the up (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward arch usually produces a softer sound, while an downward arch is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to inscribe your own marks in pencil, but remember that printed archet marks are for a musical purpose, and therefore you should generally respect them.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of salesmen.
In a carriage, they return to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who scream and shout threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – period of history in current Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological thrust or technological imperative to a strict sense that the destiny of humanity is dictated by underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The massive possession of cars also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care techniques to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury epicenter began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders recovered with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly rival.
It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western modes could accuse a delay of 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals feeling neglected by societal norms and sharing the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location, and/or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, by negligence, misfortune or voluntary abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Some wild children have been imprisoned by persons (usually their own parents) and in some cases the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When raised entirely by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical disposition) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning, but rather a way to help learners discover new teaching, such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but Microsoft Office’s little trombone man is one too.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and is intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons ranging from negligence to ill-treatment, to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We perceive the family placement system as a safety zone for these children.
Our host family placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Host family placement is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to major discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
It is claimed in particular that it can be detected if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The Speech of the President, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such interpretive abilities of human behavior may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (forks, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” a bit the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and shortly afterwards (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively silent wake-up call, so you can regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before falling asleep (especially water or tea, known to be diuretic), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real clashes, through substitute armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, other bipolar and non-aggressive pacts.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Marines' work has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it has done for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by herders who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the tracks for wagons were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day.
The crossings were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with an iron strip on the top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on wooden wagon wheels.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails made their appearance.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to stand up two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even militate in order to mitigate future suffering.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of humanity.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a draft manuscript signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets away, to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall Court on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today think that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them to be dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on both their back legs like T-Rexes.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or household chemicals.
Check the label for instructions for first aid specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very suitable insects to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs, like bedbugs, are nestlings, that is, adapted to live in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple can very well estimate that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to take care of the upbringing of a baby.
These couples can choose to do an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, the biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific research.
However, this is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but that also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns by car to get to their workplace and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on particular cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability that has sustained human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear as many complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and particular vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be mathematically represented in an approximate manner.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that gets thrown from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were astonished by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants and is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since ancient times, peoples have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in raw form and are fairly simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although it also issued the theory that the latter transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys which comprise a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil clipper.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's like climbing a hill in a heavy cart, dividing the nucleus again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on researching what makes people feel good or attracted to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's need hierarchy theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. One of the ends of the spectrum is trying to remain "the good friend" (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting assessments, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things in his/her own way.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as the point of contact of their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the goals related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in an organization’s functional services, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process to meet the customer’s need.
Before an organization is innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the scope of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumors and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never before seen.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly referred to as science fiction, it represents a very important part of the computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The purpose of artificial intelligence research is automation by task machines that require an intelligent approach.
Examples include controlling, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on bringing solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as has been demonstrated in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Very often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not envisageable.
The solution is brought by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at the old objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share its experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try the blog experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes the situation evolve.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging “obliges students to get to know the world around them better.” The need to arouse the interest of the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
“When used properly, blogs can enable students to strengthen their analytical abilities and critical thinking: by actively responding to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own views on very specific topics” (Oracec, 2002).”
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and boasts a wealth of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada’s past and present.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls and north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings that possess a pristine natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners see as Canada's quintessence.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the East African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent on its own, in terms of fauna.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Road that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too precious.
Women need to realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider harassment, because it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men's advances, and don't be afraid to stand up (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, maroquinerie, narguilés and bibelots of all kinds, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially downtown.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be investigated to understand the state of fighting that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorilla tracking treks among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, “Tombouctou” has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, it is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific fauna.
It is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the highlight of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It can be beneficial to get a Wild Card that gives access to some South African parks, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draws the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon seafront located opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is concentrated on the landfills of the northern shore.
This is the place that British settlers have invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching over 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also house some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/swimming areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (located across the bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese caboteurs, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a hooded bridge that overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque to Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts are due to be completed.
The Guaranís were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or harvesting.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as “the giant province of India”, was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its Indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Malvinas Islands is the Malvinas Islands Pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only island bank located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while at Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, even though British and American currencies may be. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Malvinas money outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located in the south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it’s colder than the thermometer says.
There are not really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the rainfall is roughly constant throughout the year.
Although many park animals are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the authorities of the park, it is necessary to stand at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, the buffalo, the moose, the orangutan, the bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a little less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval deadlock in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated at a peaceful rally held in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is on horseback on two ports. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very crowded by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is the “Number One”, a rather ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the “Manta”.
There are plenty of French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips on the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay special attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, in the north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries, and can sometimes be spotted outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would get away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies of other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport shuttle service or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They may also retain the reservation for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or provide you with other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any modification or request must, however, be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on the spot, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping site.
Remember that even if the music shows are finished on the main stages, other music shows may continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises at the level of the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are seldom windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to keep guests in good mood and keep them in place.
On some sites, it is the locals who offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone who drives to high latitudes or crosses mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or glacial temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can’t drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During the blizzards, it can fall in a very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or dust or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important time for many visitors.
In the common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African land, and especially in the savanna, with the aim of attending the spectacular spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to the cars and the standard equipment allows them to be well observed.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with twins.
A walking safari (also called “bush walk”, “walking safari” or “footing”) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may face a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
By ironing wet clothes, you can make them dry more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there are no in the rooms.
If you don’t have irons or don’t want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some locations, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, it must be done for several minutes.
The efficiency of the filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter harmful animals that they do not know in their area of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered to be parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase tax- and excise-exempt goods.
Travelers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow tracks and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are cooked and baked as pastries all year round, while cherries and plums point to the tip of their noses in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often blend particularly well with a cup of tight coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be “solid” or “liquid,” depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands in Indonesia, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that Javanese prefer being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: in fact, the user's feet can stay stuck there.
If a rider is projected from a horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, it could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a sledgehammer to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the top of the peaks, the panoramas of the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down a snowy slope with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that counts many aficionados, sometimes called “ski bums”, who organize their entire holidays based on skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: rock paintings showing skiers date back to some 5,000 BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski hiking: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rough terrain and require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to travel distances a little longer than on foot – but you’ll rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on dam tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, so under conventional circumstances, traveling through several countries means having to apply for multiple visas and undergo multiple passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without passing through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the space, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition for determining whether a manufactured object is an antiquity, and some tax organizations define more than 100-year-old goods as antiquities.
The criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Craft products can be considered antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer farming is an important means of subsistence for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance for many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, they lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as trait animals.
Today, many Sami practise modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Travellers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination region, knowing that this may have an impact on the itineraries they are considering.
Anyone considering going to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An internet search of “Course in hostile environment” will likely provide the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues addressed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, many first aid, and sometimes a training in the handling of weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers who are planning a sex change operation abroad must ensure that they have in their possession the documents valid for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports whose gender is not indicated (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is equally variable.

Transgender people in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass the scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Ripping currents are currents that return from waves that break on the beach, often on a snare or equivalent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion as a result of an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, returning to swimming is not more difficult than usual.
Try to aim at a place where you will not be taken again. It is also possible, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for the rescue.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is less long), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had a hard time adapting to the new culture sometimes have a lot of trouble adapting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them silently before the start of the show.
Usually, the noise of tourists and sellers is always heard. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include the island of Livingston and the Deception, where the caldera flooded with a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau and then reappear to form the 360 km long mountain range of Ellsworth, crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinelle chain, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote places, without a cellular telephone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people leaving school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you better chances of doing postgraduate studies in your country.
As a rule, you will have to pay an enrolment fee to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a prime destination for recreational boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Leisure sailing is a national hobby in Finland, due to a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from this, this is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only land on cruise tours, you won’t need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located at all near the seaside and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of all ages and horizons, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
Don’t be ashamed of it: it’s no different from the personal fears and fears that many people experience about other things.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft operate and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Transport companies are well-paid for fast deliveries, and often, in the context of urgent repairs, the issue of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts related to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses, there was a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to get there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better yet, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, there is no need to seek discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can rely on a certain type of travelers who are willing to pay very high for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares in good knowledge.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

There are still many women and men alive who have survived their stay here, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews indifferently.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and virtually everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that it is the first official language.

Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their time was not as worrying as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures located in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the Imperial Court.
Plants have their most beautiful appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even “one.”
