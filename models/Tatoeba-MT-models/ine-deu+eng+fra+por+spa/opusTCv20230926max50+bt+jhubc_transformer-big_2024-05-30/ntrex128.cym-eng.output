They're worried that they're going to look "real"
Some CPAs are concerned about suggesting changing their titles in English to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of Parliament for Wales in Welsh).
This is due to plans to change the name of the Assembly in Senedd Cymru.
Across the political spectrum, ACs are concerned that this could be a dirty subject.
He said his group was concerned because the title was "splitting with the words Twp and Pwp."
And to anyone who understands the Welsh language: You don't want to be called by that name.
He said the whole group was "unhappy" with the suggestion and that they had offered other options.
The Welsh Conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the name change, but suggested there was not much verbal difference between MWP and "Muppet."
The ASC Welsh translation does not cause so much trouble.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptions of the titles of Assembly Members will be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals. It was seen that there was broad support for calling the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In terms of the title of the Assembly Members, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), but the MWP came out stronger in the public consultation.
According to the statement, ACau suggests other options, but the work of coming to a consensus could cause the President, Elin Jones, to end. She is expected to introduce draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
The legislation on the amendments will include other changes to the way the scheme works, including rules on the non-applicability of ACs and the design of the committee's system.
The ACs will have the final vote on what they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to "North Macedonian Republic."
This popular vote was formed in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, a neighboring country with its own country called Macedonia.
Athens has long demanded that its northern neighbor's name represent the right of its territory. She has opposed the country's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO rotating.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the country's name change vote and has said he will disregard the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Churches in Harlem Facing Difficulties
"Historically, there was a bar and church at every corner, according to the old people I've talked to," Mr. Adams said.
Today, there is one of them."
He said he could understand why the bars had disappeared.
"People are socializing in a different way today," he said.
"At present, bars are not considered to be communal living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
In terms of churches, he is concerned that the money obtained by selling assets will not last long as the leaders expect him to do, "and sooner or later, they will be back in the same old situation."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by flats with condominiums full of the kind of people who won't help the rest of the area's shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "which will mean that all these churches will close sooner because it's unlikely that most of these people will move into the condominium."
The two churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved from there in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshipping nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's Church was transferred to a black congregation under the Venerable John Howard Johnson, which led a coalition of retailers on 125th Street, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, which refused to hire or raise black people.
The building was horribly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's wrecks made plans for reconstruction, the fences were commissioned.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, was proud to name them "the earls of the poor."
The expert who sang the earrings in July gave them another name: "cultural treasure" and "a unique historical tool."
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noted that these were the first earrings in the world to be sung by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to sing the larger earrings at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one had found St. Martin's Church in its place.
What has happened in the church of St. Martin over the past few months has been a complex history of patrons and contractors, some of whom have been employed by the church's clergy, and others by the bishopric.
He wrote to the diocese in July to point out concerns that the diocese would "try to transfer the costs" to the diocese, although the diocese had not been contacted by the clergy and the clergy.
There were some who complained that there was a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy is injured when he drifts to search for gypsies in California.
According to officials, a squirrel attacked a 13-year-old child and injured him on Saturday as he swam to search for kites in California, on the first day of the kites' season.
The attack took place just before 7am near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Then, he swam to him with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he believed he was excited to catch the boy's giggle at first. But after the boy arrived, Hammel told him "realizing he was shouting, 'I've been beaten!
I've been beaten!"
The bridge of his shoulder was torn open."
I begged everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was picked up from the water in a stream and taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in a serious condition.
We don't know what kind of attacker was responsible for the attack.
In brief to the media, the lifesaver, Captain Larry Giles, said that sharks had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous kind of shark.
Giles said the victim had sustained injuries to the top of his body.
Officers blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas. They did so for 48 hours for security and investigation purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of cod in the area but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty jewelry in the form of department stores that include expert assistants.
As part of the effort to reach the UK's beauty market, a <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn market that continues to grow although fashion and home goods sales are declining, the larger beauty shelves of this size will be tested in 11 stores across the country if they close.
This investment comes into the world of beauty as supermarkets search for ways to use empty shelves after being chased for TV sets, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of its beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Goods from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you'd see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique hair collection so that most of the products are suitable for vegans - something that is increasingly appealing among young shoppers.
In addition, the perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions in two of Sainsbury's stores. The first will open in Croydon in south London last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people shop online and move towards buying a little bit of food every day in local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the outlets will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with the Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's has been putting Expo outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought the two chains two years ago. It says that that has reinforced food sales and ensured that acquisitions are more proving.
The previous effort of the supermarket to rewet its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's proposed a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership came to an end following a dispute over how to split the pharmacy's store revenues in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s, three years ago, sold its pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain. The business consisted of 281 stores and was sold for <0xC2><0xA3>125m.
He said Lloyds would be part of the plan as it would add an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have completely changed the look and feel of our beauty heels in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in co-workers who have been specially trained and will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an essential beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Holly Willoughby has withdrawn <0xC2><0xA3>11 million from the deal.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, was shocked after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his branded way of life business, to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand of accessories and home goods.
The couple's business was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, one of the presenters This Morning, had posted a message on Instagram announcing that she was leaving.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is thrilled after Holly Willoughby pulled out of her branded way of living at the last minute - to focus on her own big new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "confused" on Tuesday when the presenter admitted at a meeting at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she didn't have enough money and more brand time.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to have doubled Willoughby's fortune, an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones from Britain traveled to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
That was her future in the long run and the work she would have done over the next few decades.
Everyone was surprised to hear that she had decided to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, and she was so close to the launch.
There's a full stock of goods in the capital in Marlow, and the ones are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that this decision by one of Britain's most bankable stars could cost the company millions due to large investments in products, including cushions, candles, clothing and goods to the home as well. This could mean a lot of money.
This may also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chair in March.
The couple are going on holiday together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as a presenter for I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Last night, a source who is friends with Jones said, "We're not going to pay attention to his business issues."
It was hard, and then we fell in love.
He made fun of the end of the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a "unreasonable" comment, according to some, and for being so positive when talking about the North Korean leader.
Why did the President of the United States give up so much?
Trump said in a whispered statement.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was keen to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting Trump described as a major step forward to unraveling North Korea.
However, the talks on clarification have slowed down.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not believe that the U.S. is a good fit.
Instead, he said that the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressures.
Trump was a lot more faithful in his big speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results - stopping the testing of missiles, helping to release whistleblowers and ensuring the rest of America's soldiers return home.
He went on to justify his unusual way of acting in terms of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but rather than having 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this full arena, we would have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroys Island, Killing Hundreds
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, something that is necessary to disrupt international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have explained that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is quite challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children creates a team to travel to Palu, they are still not sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national agency for disasters, said officials from Indonesia were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be given assistance.
Because the earth is constantly shaking in Indonesia, the country is never prepared enough for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other shores.
It seems that no siren has been found warning of the tsunami in Palu, although a warning has been given, and that has contributed to the number of deaths.
It is difficult to travel between numerous islands of Indonesia at best.
Natural disasters mean that the logistics are even more complex.
A hospital ship that opened in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's racing infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But a lack of money has been a handful on Mr. Joko's administration as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from long-term nominal densities in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, arrows and arrows, as well as other insurmountable weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of the Liverpool team, scoring an equal goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge stopped Liverpool from losing a Super League game to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a bass from Xherdan Shaqiri and he scored about 30 goals from Chelsea with his team losing 1-0.
The ball moved to its left before firing towards the outer post.
The ball lifted high above the box as it moved towards the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball came down for Kepa Arrizabalaga as he jumped and the ball dropped to the net.
"I was trying to go to that site and get hold of the ball and players like Shaq always play when it's possible, so I was trying to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and kicked the ball without thinking too much about it, just going about it."
Half-time, Chelsea won 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the Belgian star, scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea team shooter passed the ball with his saddle back to Mateo Kovacic that time, before turning away near the middle of the field and sprinting into half of Liverpool.
Kovacic gave a bass ‘cico and go’ quickly in the middle of the field.
Then the ball clashed smoothly between the other team's defenders, leading Hazard to the box.
Hazard was earlier than the defender and finished in the grid of the farthest post with chic with his left foot passing to Alisson Becker, one of the Liverpool players.
Liverpool plays against Napoli in a group match at the Council on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
It was reported that many people were sitting in the midst of the rubble of buildings that fell when the 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, an earthquake that caused waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugrodho said.
The city of Palu, comprising more than 380,000 people, was covered with debris from buildings that were demolished.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was beaten to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Menbedw, Waterfront, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55am and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to let them know if they have heard or seen anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'Although the investigation is just beginning, I would ask anyone who was in the John Street area in Menbedw to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
Also, if anyone, especially taxi drivers, has caught anything on board gamers, they should contact us for fear of having information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found dead came from the Penbedw area and that her body was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the site to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing and the police say they are informing the victim's closest relative.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews is trying to get back to his apartment but police have told him that no one is getting in or out of the building.
He had no words when he heard what had happened.
Residents are now informed that they will have to wait a few hours before getting back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman reached the spot in her tears.
She continued, "It's such a terrible thing."
At 2pm there were two police stations in the cordon and another was outside it.
A number of officers were standing in the cordon monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 indicating record 247 30 September.
Cromwell's sculpture outside the Senedd is the latest memoir to be part of the 'history reshuffle' dispute
The removal of the statue would be a laudable justification for the envy-induced destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artefacts, a destruction made by its fanatical Pyrrhic followers.
But Cromwell Society said Mr Crick's suggestion was one "true" that "tried to rebuild history."
John Goldsmith, chair of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable, in the current discussion about removing sculptures, that Oliver Cromell's figure outside St. Stephen's Square would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for fulfilling or ordering the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his great-grandfather Thomas in the previous century.
An excellent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century's judgment and is part of the history of a figure that many people believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell a figure who defended the House from external pressures, namely the kingdom in his case.
I don't know if that's true or not, and that's an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the upheaval in the middle of the 17th century has guided the development of our country after that and Cromwell is an individual well-known figure representing one side of the dispute.
His achievements as a Lord's Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Pig Rheibus Kills a Farmer from China
He attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The South China Morning Post said on Sunday that a man, who was known by his nickname ‘Yuan’, had been found dead near a pig's wolf in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province. His artery had been broken and he was bleeding for it.
A pig farmer was preparing to spray pests on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he had traveled with his cousin from the neighboring state of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his brother-in-law found him dead and noticed that a nearby pigtail door was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the wolf and there was blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-weight pig ripped the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My sister's legs had been torn and they were all blood," said the relative, who was called by his nickname, "Wu," according to a quote in the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera video showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
It wasn't Yuan or his cousin who owned the animal that killed the man.
One of the market managers told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence on the site.
According to reports, the Yuan family and the market authorities are discussing compensation for his death.
Although there are not many of them, there are other records of cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife frightened the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that bloody taste can cause them to behave like that.
"They're cautious.
They're young, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You have to give them a lot of respect," he said.
The remainder of the hurricane caused heavy rainfall over a large area of the southwestern U.S.
According to forecasts, the Rosa Wind is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the west coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall across northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa had 85 mya winds, Category 1 Hurricane, from 5am Eastern time on Sunday. The wind was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a dock begins to form across the Pacific and moves eastward towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, the hurricane will begin to swirl.
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will rework with the approaching wetland causing heavy rain over the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of hand will cause dangerous major floods, a flood of rubble and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rain rates between 2 and 3 inches every hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of hand is expected in parts of the southeast, especially over much of Arizona.
It is possible that large floods with the conditions will deteriorate rapidly due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
It would be very annoying to venture out into the desert on foot with a threat of tropical hand.
Heavy rains could cause the rivers to become wild rivers and a storm of lightning and thunderstorms will cause strong winds and dust blows in the area.
The approaching dock will cause some local heavy hand in parts of the Southern California coast.
It is possible that a total of more than half an inch of hand will fall, which could cause a small flow of rubbish and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the area during its wet season.
A few scattered tropical rains will begin arriving in Arizona late on Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads further late on Monday and Tuesday night.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last throughout Wednesday.
The temperatures will change dramatically across the U.S. during October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in the temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature through the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what's left of the summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
A large portion of the middle and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start to October with temperatures in the 1980s from the Southern Observatories to parts of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance of temperatures higher than average for the eastern U.S. throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of his sexual abuse in the 1980s, testified on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political disagreement continued, with broadcasters questioning normal programs to broadcast the unexpected time Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona senator Jeff Flake, notes that the FBI will be conducting a probe into the matter.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her inappropriately and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party, and he had been drunk.
Kavanaugh said in giving his testimony that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company counted the average number of audiences on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available directly for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
To give a perspective, the size of this audience was similar to that of an audience who would watch a football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, the channel's guest reviews have given strong support to appoint Kavanaugh, who led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted throughout the day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 viewers, NSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was a lot of interest in listening as well.
Flake was the most prominent figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republicans declared that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was arrested on CNN and CBS on Friday morning with protesters shouting at him as he attempted to enter an elevator for a hearing.
He stared at the floor for a few minutes as he got his head full, live on CNN television.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He was told, "You have the power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say after hearing the committee.
The cable and broadcast networks were all filming live hours later, when it was time for the Judiciary Committee to vote to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and get a vote in the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI would investigate the allegations against whom he nominated by the following week, a result that minority Democrats have been encouraging.
Flake was partially convicted after a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and many other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
AS UK May accuses critics of 'playing politics' in Brexit case
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union, saying they were "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the budget.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Great Britain, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her interview on the front page of the new paper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, criticised what she calls the Chequers Brexit plan, saying it was "completely ridiculous" for the EU to impose a tariff that should be imposed.
Wayde Sims shooting case: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of killing one of LSU players
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and will go to jail on suspicion of a second murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say the Sims lost their glasses during the event.
Police found the glasses on the site and said they had found Simpson's DNA on it, the CBS receives WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
He has a $350,000 fund, the spokesman said.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying that a gunshot wound to the head into the neck is the cause of death.
The department commends the task of Louisiana State Police refugees, the state's police crime lab, the University of the South's police and local citizens for helping in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the team for enforcing the area's law for its "diligence and work to ensure justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot and six-inch forward was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 points in the game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU football coach Will Wade said the team had "broken their hearts" and "feared" after hearing about Wayde's death.
That's the kind of thing you're worried about all the time.
A fire breaks out over the city of Mexico
The ashes that accumulate from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after activity increased in the cave and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered over 24 hours.
The center monitored a number of earthquakes and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car front windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have noticed an increase in the volcano's activity that is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is called "Don Goyo" and has been alive since 1994.
The police clash with Catalan separatists before celebrating a year since the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two independent protesters clashed with the anti-terrorism police and as thousands joined competing protests to mark a year since Catalonia's split up.
A group of people in mosquitoes who were in favour of separating the anti-disturbance police who were holding them back with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Counter-terrorism was also found later in the day, with the police using their sticks to control the fighting.
For a number of hours, independence groups shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" and united protesters shouted "Long live Spain."
14 people were treated for minor injuries that were found in the protests, according to the local press.
The tensions are still high in this region that is currently on independence, a year after the 1 October referendum that Madrid considered illegal but which was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose to become independent, but not many people came to vote and those opposed to segregation boycotted the vote significantly.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
On Friday night, groups of independents encamped to stop opposition from the national police force.
The opposition went ahead, but he was forced to follow suit on another occasion.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was going to test the separatists with his wife, he was no longer faithful about gaining independence from Catalonia.
"Last year, we had one of the best times ever.
I've seen my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but we're back in the same old situation now," he said.
Although they succeeded in obtaining a small but crucial victory in the regional elections in December last year, pro-independence groups have found it difficult to keep the momentum to go this year and many of their most unfamiliar backward leaders are either unwilling or self-deprecated.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone to support the police, politicians on both sides had been stirring the waters during the clash.
Emotions are increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would apply for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Was Driven Into House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven several times into a house in Londonderry.
This took place in Crescent Ballynagard on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had been done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been shot at the head of the car as well.
Menga's shot secured a 1-0 win to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal over Livingston secures victory for Livingston
Livingston stunned the Rangers causing Steven Gerrard to lose again in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot was the difference as Gary Holt's team climbed to the Hibernian level in an instant.
Gerrard's team have not won a home game in the Premier League this season and they face the Hearts next Saturday, who are on the top and eight points ahead.
Before that, the Rangers will hold a game against Rapid Vienna in the European Union on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has beaten six games in a row in the subsection, and head coach Holt hasn't lost a game since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing opportunities against visitors.
Holt's team should have been at the forefront long before they scored and their direct nature caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but dragged his effort across the goal face, so Alan Lithgow could only aim his effort broadly after sliding to meet Craig Halkett's pitfall across the goal,
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties to others in certain places.
And that's how the key was found.
The free-kick Rangers retired and Livingston worked to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to help Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
Meanwhile, the Rangers managed possession of the ball but they couldn't break through the defenders of the home team and goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, didn't worry much.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's savings.
Scott Pittman was rejected at the foot of Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lithgow swept the ball wide from another set played by Livingston.
Crusaders came to the Livingston box continually and they continued to be cleared, and were given two rights to a penalty kick - after Halkett challenged the player's deputy, Glenn Middleton, and one for a handball - ignored.
'Awesome performance' by Livingston -
Alasdair Lamont, one of the BBC Scotland dancers at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Amazing performance and results for Livingston.
They were great and they continue to raise the expectations on this path that is upwards.
Their playing style and staff have not changed much since they reached the top, but Holt has to be commended for the way he has propelled the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, arranging a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet throughout the game.
But the Rangers didn't have much inspiration.
Although they had played well at times under Gerrard's control, the standards of the people were not seen.
They had a lot of grip on their last ball - only once they opened the side at home - and there was a bit of a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Welcome to Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
It was blue sky and everyone was wailing on Saturday (May 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - a visit to try to improve the ties between NATO allies.
They have disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkic population outside of Turkey.
The police had given security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters had come near the mosque to see their leader.
Hundreds of protesters who were against Erdogan – many of them Guards – made sure their voices were heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
These conquest protests reflect the rift associated with the visitor, a man who is considered a hero by some German Turks and is considered an autocrat by others.
Car crash in Deptford: Biker dies in collision with car
A man has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics came, but the man died on the scene.
The crash has occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a ‘tapping and fleeing’ accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and let his closest relative know.
Road closure arrangements and directions have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers have been injured in an accident
Six officers have been injured in an accident in a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Office.
The incident took place at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been called there to deal with the tragedy, which involves eight prisoners and takes place in one single awning.
The minor injuries that the officers had on their faces on the site were treated.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Personal prisons with specialized training have been there to deal with this event that continues in Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend more time in prison."
Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison includes more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was said that the prison governor had been treated in the hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
And in October of last year, anti-terrorism officers were summoned to the prison to deal with a serious tragedy in which staff were attacked with pellets.
Pink Flood in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Can Dry Elva Areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what is likely to happen next week as the rest of the Rosa Storm travels across the Southwestern Desert, causing a risk of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will keep an eye on major floods Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Las Vegas.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, turning her hand late on Monday night.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained storm or low-pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a wind within 40 miles of the AZ borders."
The latest models of the National Centre on the Oceans are previewed between 2 and 4 inches in size, with a few examples of a total of up to 6 inches on the Arizona Mogollon Edge.
Other areas in the Southwestern Desert including the Great Basin and the Middle Rockies are likely to be between 1 and 2 inches, with a total case number of up to 4 inches possible.
For those who are not at risk of major flooding, Rosa rain can be of benefit to them as they live in a dry area.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, it is likely that some of this rain will be beneficial because of dry conditions in the Southwest at the moment.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a little over 40% of Arizona's population is experiencing extreme drought at least, the highest category only one," weather.com said.
To begin with, the Rosa Trail will lead to land along the Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, who was still as strong as a Sunday morning hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north by traveling 12 miles per hour.
The storm reaches the cooler waters of the Pacific so it weakens.
Due to this, the storm is expected to reach the land in Mexico on the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
The rain could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of hand is expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a low-pressure storm, which will then travel up through Arizona and to the right of Utah arriving late Tuesday night.
"The main danger that is expected due to Rosa or the remnants of the storm is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and southwestern U.S. Desert," the National Centre on Winds said.
This rain is expected to create large floods that can endanger life as well as a flood of rubble in the desert and earthquakes on mountainous land.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys in their teens and one 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found to have been stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and remains there in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The officials have asked anyone who has material on their mobile phone from what happened to present that testimony.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered the anger and resentment" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's shameless and shameful tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the anger and resentment" of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and was appalled by the denial of Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he had been sexually abused decades ago, and both in their teens.
Ford testified in the hearing about his claim as well.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people have seen the glory and the standard and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"I voted to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal workers of our life, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service," he told the crowd of supporters in North Virginia.
The President inadvertently referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republican Assembly in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our life.
"I'm not trying, but I'm really trying," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere trying to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is "to resist and block."
The first key legislative vote on the floor of the Senedd on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday evening, the GOP's senior assistant leadership told CNN.
Hundreds were killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them were swept away as huge waves broke on the beaches after a major earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi island in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters fell on the beach late at night, sweeping many from there and killing and damaging anything along the way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the warning of the tsunami was received yesterday, people were carrying on their activities on the beach, they did not run from there immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, Jakupo.
The tsunami was not on its own, it was dragging cars, shovels, houses, it was hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open sea at a speed of 800 yards (497 mia) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 Palu centers.
Photos from the air released by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops had been damaged, bridges had fallen and mosques were surrounded by water.
The earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area that included 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by a massive Friday earthquake is about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The city's geography, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have inflated the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as one "heartbreak" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under rubble buildings that had fallen, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of people injured could be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggata, which is closer to the earthquake's peak.
"There was no way to communicate with Donggala to get information," Nugroho said.
"More than 300,00 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a disaster already, but the situation could get worse," he said.
The agency was convicted on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film shared on social media, a man on the floor can be heard shouting at people on the street below warning them that a tsunami is on its way.
Within minutes, a wall of water struck the lake, carrying buildings that were hidden from there.
Reuters was not able to validate the film immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that turned off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but there is a real need for food and other essentials on those who have had to leave their homes.
The city's airfield has been reopened only for support efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to go to the rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in the Indonesian tsunami.
It's a terrible situation.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have reached Palu city safely, where workers take shelter in tarpaulin shelters installed in the yard of their offices, they have crossed winding views on the road, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as support groups go on to start the emergency relief process, some have complained that specialist foreign aid workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies or staff cannot be provided unless the site of the disaster has been declared as a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened again.
"It's still a disaster at the state level," said Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Indonesia.
"After the government says, 'yes, this is a national disaster,' we can get international support, but there is no status yet."
As she spent the night in Palu for the second time following the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hoped that their loved ones would live by some miracle, which would relieve some of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a young boy was taken out of a car.
On Sunday, rescuers managed to release a woman who had been detained under rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the losing paragliders for the Asian Games, held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said that his disciples were among those who were sitting in the Roa Roa hotel.
"As someone with experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional son," he said.
In the hours after the paragliding community heard about the news that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, Mr. Gendon said he had sent a host of WhatsApp messages to the rivals from Palu who were taking part in the beach festival.
But there was only one gray tick next to his messages, rather than two blue docks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 as ATM machine gets refilled in Newport on the Levee
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was replenishing an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM machine in the entertainment building, preparing to provide more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
When he was busy, another man made a "run from behind the Brink worker" and took a bag of money that was to be provided.
He saw many other witnesses fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people who were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about who these people are should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is formally identified as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a time and used the name as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before it appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He's going on the show instead of Ariana Grande, the singer from America who pulled back because of "emotional circumstances," said the creator of the show.
In addition to being a connoisseur of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'yes' is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year in discussing the title of his album with Big Boy, who presents on the radio.
"It's you, it's us, it's not us.
The name of Kanye, which means the only one, went to Ye only - reflecting the good, the evil and the mess, everything.
It's more than just a reflection of who we are."
There are a number of other famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been given a variety of names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he better has the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to collaborate with West, has also been using his name by varying it in terms of the heaps and the privileges.
Amlo in Mexico vows not to use soldiers against citizens
Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use soldiers against citizens as the country celebrates 50 years since the bloody revenge against students.
On Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed "never to use the army to defeat the people of Mexico."
Soldiers fired during a peaceful counterattack on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, when left-wing student movements were rooted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support the young people of Mexico by providing support to those who study and open more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities mean that young people are being lured into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the money it spends on research in the field, said the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Microsoft, Apple and Google.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government make announcements about artificial comprehension, although the U.S. does not have a general strategy for artificial comprehension.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year, which aims to be the best country in terms of all innovations by 2030.
"Securing double the funding for research in the field of artificial understanding would be a good start, given that all other countries are much less developed than the U.S., and we are looking for the next discovery in the field of understanding," he said.
The doubling of funding could mean doubling the opportunity to ensure that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence is being achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee has published his book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is the Chief Executive Officer of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face+.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an artificial comprehension system that beat the best Othello player in America. Later he became an executive officer at Microsoft Research and China branch president Google.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. government's previous technology competitions as the Higher Research Research Agency's Robotics Challenge in the field of Defense, and asked when it would be next to help identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win grants from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders; it's the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recently attempted to hire brilliant students from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said changes to the relocation policy could help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be offered automatically to people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China announced its Plan for the Development of Artificial Understanding of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Institute of Natural Sciences and other governmental institutions give money to researchers from the U.S.A., but it is the lowest standard of education in the U.S.A.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Understanding, which is to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced that the Select Committee on Artificial Understanding is in charge.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment in an enterprise called AI Next.
In terms of the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in Research on Artificial Understanding.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in place for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "North Macedonian Republic," which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which had prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a country called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name represents the right of its territory and has prevented the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's most prolific Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a crackdown campaign has cast doubts as to whether the number of voters will meet the 50 percent target needed to validate the referendum.
This is the question I voted for in the referendum: "Are you in favour of becoming a member of NATO and the EU and accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Those in favour of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the only developing countries to have fallen to Yugoslavia, to have access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because that ensures safer lives for all of us," Georgijevska, 79, said in a statement.
Although they are not legally bound, many members of parliament have said they will wait for the result of the vote to make it a definite vote.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority would be required in the House.
The state's election commission said there was no mention of any inconveniences by 1pm.
However, only 16 per cent voted, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 per cent of the voters who had registered voted.
I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name to Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, a change that would mean the country could join NATO and the United Nations.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join if we can hold our heads high, not through the doors of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says joining NATO will secure an investment that he really needs in Macedonia, a country whose unemployment rate is higher than 20 per cent.
I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that the "yes" result would "consolidate our future."
According to a vote set up last Monday by the Macedonian Institution for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - which is lower than the required number.
Another vote, held by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 per cent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, that would be the first serious shot at the Western government's policy since it took the oaths in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, pass all Brighton defenders and get a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders during a 2-0 Manchester City victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
He made it look so easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The gunman was shot in the middle of the field at the beginning of the follow-up.
He ran through three Brighton defenders, before reaching the open field.
Then Aguerro was surrounded by four green shirts.
One defender pushed away before running faster than many others on the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he gave a pass to his left, giving the ball to Sterling.
The England forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, with a shot to the right of the net.
Aguero has some problems with his feet," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We had discussed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first advantage in the High League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguerro received the ball in Brighton territory at the time.
He gave a nice touch through the players along the backside to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times before leading Sterling towards the outer post.
Chelsea's frontman kicked the ball into the net before sliding across the border.
Manchester City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Jokes to play against the Rockies
Since the Nationals don't have the hope of competing in the second chance games, there's not much reason to force another beginner.
But Scherzer hopes to stand on Sunday's turmoil to face the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are consequences in terms of second chance games for the Rockies, who save the front on the Los Angeles Dodgers from one game in the league of the West NL.
The Rockies secured a second chance at least with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to secure their place in the first group.
"While we're not playing for anything, at least we can kick the rubber knowing that there will be a good atmosphere here with the crowd in Denver and that the other team will play at the highest level I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in a game like this?"
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday again, but according to the statement they wish to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had an exercise session on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher who plays for Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 shots ‘strikeout’ in 220 2/3 hits this season.
Trump's presence in North Virginia
The President inadvertently referred to the situation concerning his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and he spoke of the importance of the Assembly of the Republic in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done is going to be done in November.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our life.
This is one of the big, big ones - I'm not applying but I'm really applying, that's why I travel everywhere fighting for great applicants," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group here, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to take the power back by using any means it needs, you see the resentment, the frustration.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to get power and control, they want to get power and control, we're not going to give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are trying to "resist and stop."
"And we've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "flaw and hatred and unwelcome and liar."
She referred to the name of the high-ranking Democratic senator, Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a loud voice was heard among the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
"Did you share the document?
Y, y, what.
No, no, wait a minute - that was an example of bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Work isn't a big deal anymore.
They don't tolerate those who say what they say.
When the members of Momentum took part in my local polls to vote for me, it was a big surprise.
After all, I'm the latest among many Labor ASs to be heard that we're not welcome - and that's to say.
My co-worker in parliament, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way for standing firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the offer of punishment was blaming me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagrees with him about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe. Ironically, these are issues similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in their circles.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Works meeting on Friday indicated "we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive."
During most of my eight years as the local AS Labour, the Friday night GC meetings have been such meetings.
Unfortunately, there is no such noise in most of the meetings today and we have long forgotten about the promise of "more kinder, more tender" politics, whether or not that has ever been found.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every view is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became EU leader. There were co-workers I used to think they were from the same political background as me starting to expect me to take a pejorative turn and support views that I would never have agreed with them otherwise - no matter what.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I'm actually saying - it will lead to harsh attacks on social media calling for my non-election, condemning the politics of the center, saying no to the media.
And I'm not the only one who has experienced this.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my co-workers because the comments that are being addressed to me tend to be political.
I respect the professional and decisive nature of those co-workers who face a lot of sexual or racial abuse every day but don't let that get over them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way in which levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we're not so generous now and with every attempt of "defense" or a change to the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years encouraging me to keep my head down, not to say my opinion too much, then I'd be "right."
But that's not why I chose to be a politician.
I joined Labour as a 32-year-old school pupil, after being overwhelmed by the skepticism of the Thatcher government, a government that was responsible for the torturous condition of the classroom of my combined school. Since then I have been trying to promote the best possible services of the public.
I've never been a fan of politics, not even in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham would have been able to misunderstand my political views and the areas I disagree with in the circle of the current leadership.
To those who promoted Friday's proposal, all I have to say is that I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party with the country moving towards a Brexit that will be a stimulus to citizens, citizens.
But, in fact, I do not have a message to Momentum Nottingham, but a message to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that there will be no number of threats from my non-election or political advantages that will prevent me from getting the job.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Father on the brink of death
It may be that two late applications have somehow failed on the final result, but it is certain that Dad deserves to win this Tennent High League game.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team that hasn't been beaten out of ten.
Ultimately, their excellent defense work, as well as their work of taking advantage of opportunities, was responsible for maintaining the home team and coach, Peter Murchie, had every right to be proud.
We've had some challenging games so far, but no one has beaten us, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Honor Father, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson applied in the 14th minute, and was converted by Frazier Climo, making sure that Ayr was ahead. However, the yellow card that was given the Scottish cap, Rory Hughes, was released for the game by the Warriors, meaning that without him, Melrose was able to manage.
Climo ensured that Ayr never got ahead with a chic penalty, before he, just half time, scored and converted an individual application to secure a score of 17-5 for Ayr in the meantime.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's application, which was converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
Then there was a little delay because Ruaridh Knott had been seriously injured, and was carried away on a strass. After they restarted, Ayr had more success following an application from Stafford McDowall, who had been converted by Climo.
Then, Father's temporary captain, Blair Macpherson, got a yellow card, and again, Melrose made the additional player pay with an unconverted request by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty kick line, MacPherson dropped the ball behind Dad's increasing scoring.
Climo overturned the application, as he did again almost immediately after re-starting, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's cock and sent forward Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth application.
Star Still Game is looking for a new career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, one of Still Game's stars, hopes to move into the hospitality industry after he finds out he's been named director of a licensed food company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, along with writing and acting alongside his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth series to come will be the last in the show's history and Kiernan seems to be planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but one of the Scottish Sun's sources suggested that Kiernan hopes to be part of Glasgow's "prosperous food business."
'No Sea': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Seafarers patrol the naval headquarters of a rigged garrison in La Paz.
Public buildings are waving blue flags like the sea.
Maritime centers from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the signs: "The sea is not owned by right.
It's a duty to restore it."
Bolivia has been encircled and the memory of the forline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive - just like the desire to sail the Pacific once again.
These hopes are clearer than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a verdict by the international justice court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has a momentum, a sense of unity and tranquility, and for that reason it is faithful in waiting for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
A number of Bolivian citizens will watch the ruling of the international court of justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim - after decades of caucus talks - that Chile must negotiate an opening.
Evo Morales, a charismatic president native to Bolivia - who faces a contentious battle for next year's re-election - relies heavily on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is not likely to decide in favor of Bolivia - and not much would change if the court did.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate the territory of Chile, and it has demanded that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ruling of the international justice court comes only six months after the final disputes were heard suggests "the case was not one complex," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean who specializes in international law.
And rather than improving the case of Bolivia, it is possible that the last four years have worsened the case.
"The current Bolivian administration has questioned this issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales's warlordship has undermined any good will left by Chile, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold negotiations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ballots since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process is usually a rapid process.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an exceptional opportunity to begin a new period of contacts with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement over mutual benefits," he said.
Also, Calzadilla denied that Marales - who still remains one of the most popular Latin American presidents - used the maritime issue as a political bug.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
It's an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says it will not remove its nuclear weapons unless it can be trusted by the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons unless the party trusts Washington first.
He was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
He called on the United States to stick to the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy that he would not be able to reach an agreement, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's just a woman's dream that the continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to declaring an end to the Korean War will make the North surrender.
Washington refuses to agree with the statement before Pyongyang makes significant disarmament moves first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are expected to hold a second summit.
But there is much doubt as to whether Pyongyang is serious about dropping weapons that the country, more than likely, considers as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows reveals that the latest collection of huge jeans is about to reach your Grand Street
If you want another hat or if you want to stop the sun altogether, this is the fashion for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a variety of huge and spectacular headwear for their SS19 collection on the fashion stage, which was shining on the set of styles at Paris Fashion Week.
Very practical hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the amazing creations of these designers have been seen on the fashion platform.
One of Valentino's striking items was a fluffy hat over the head of a glass decorated with a large plough edge covering the heads of the models.
Among the other great accessories were watermelons decorated with games, even a wizard's hat and pineapple - but these hits wouldn't heat your head.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of strange threats - and that's in good time for Winter Calan.
Many of the colorful mosquitoes had their lips sewn together and were more like Hannibal Lecter's than a high-pitched typo.
One of them looked like a scuba diving suit with a snorkel and glasses, and the other looked like a ia memory cone, which had melted.
And, if you're enjoying the big fashion statements - this is your chance.
The ones who keep an eye on style anticipate that huge bones could reach your large street.
These big hats follow the ‘La Bomba’ style, the popular straw hats with the wide two-foot edge, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind these practical hats that were seen on social media had another great creation on the fashion platform as well - a straw bag almost as large as the model in a swimsuit that was wearing it.
The burning orange electric bag, decorated with an electric edge and a white leather handle, was one of the most striking items in the La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the big street next summer - as the designer has made so much of an impression, it would be difficult to avoid the call for big accessories.'
John Edward: Language Skills are Essential for Global Citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a good reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional outcomes in the examinations, but that is only complemented by individual and joint success in the fields of sports, art, music and endeavors.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), seek to provide the best level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for further education and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and operate a leading school curriculum, we continue to see modern languages as popular subjects that are chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it will stay in their memory.
If you speak to someone in their own language, it will remain in their heart."
This is a powerful message to remind us that we can't rely solely on English when trying to foster connections and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the results of this year's exams recently, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables and include the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who studied foreign languages have received a high grade A.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are members of SCIS, show that 72 percent of pupils had a Grade A High in Mandarin, and that 72 percent of those who were studying German, 69 percent of those who were studying A and 63 percent of those who were studying Frange.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages, such as topics, are now treated in the same way as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in a curriculum of independent schools and in other places.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that a lack of language skills accounted for 17 per cent of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies.
Therefore, there is more appeal for languages in order to prepare young people for their careers for the future.
With more planned job opportunities in demand for languages, these skills are essential in a global environment. . . .
No matter what career a person chooses, if that person has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future of having such a long-term skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will be on the move immediately.
According to a vote by YouGov that included more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. In addition, French was the only language spoken by a percentage double figure, namely 15 percent.
This is the reason why investing in language education is important for children today.
Understanding a number of languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children a better opportunity to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages they will be taught.
A number of schools will focus on classic modern languages, but other schools will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking around 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages you can choose from in independent schools, and the schools will include teaching staff who specialize in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever is ahead of them.
There is currently no denying, in a global business environment, that languages are still essential to the country's future, so that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, has announced that James will play in the opening game of the series before Sunday's start of the season receiving the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how many minutes he'll play again.
"It will be more than one but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"At this point in my career, I don't need games before the season to prepare," he said.
West Virginia Trump Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump is launching a series of campaign rallyes tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including visits and friendly venues such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice for the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking support for the midterm elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below using a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the hearings this week for his nomination to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who is under stress as a result of allegations of sexual misconduct with the vote to confirm it in the deferred parliament for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans facing tough elections in November to gain some momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies over the next week would aim to "incite volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to defend and add to the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress' control is so important to its agenda until the President makes travel to as many states as possible before the start of the important campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, rallies could come and supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get attention from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, a state that won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Parliamentary candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the penitentiary.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come here to try to boost him in the penalty fields," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team showcases the flop to fight ahead as they go to individual games on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth afternoon on Saturday might be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a concept that has been conceived in the sports world but it is a concept that the players believe in, especially in competitions like this.
So, where do you think they are at the moment?
"They were ahead of six points and now it's four, so we have a little momentum to know," Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the plate with another eleven to play.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in their minds and they have enough to cheer them up, especially by Speith and Justin Thomas who played together throughout the day and got three points out of four.
It's been a great experience from you to the core and it's leading by example.
The screams of joy went up as his round went on, succeeding with an essential pit to go on a game to four of the same although he and Thomas had been down two after two.
There was a similar scream after the pit that the gem won them on the 15th, the kind of scream that tells you he doesn't think America is out of it again.
"You have to focus and worry about your own game," Speith said.
That's the only thing that these players have now.
18 holes to create an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the iconic Ryder Cup story.
A couple of odd but like Europe have four for four and they can't do anything wrong."
"Moliwood" was the only bar that didn't have a Saturday afternoon, and they didn't have a Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, or the last nine Friday morning either.
That race, and the way the energy flows between them and the crowd, confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, which would make the same player more popular to confirm Europe's victory as their right to compete for the National Golf Le.
If possible the two at the same price on different holes.
However, it's early to talk about the European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hit Sergio Garcia, the hero of four balls the morning, easily when he was beaten by Alex Noren.
Following a swing and two doubles in the first nine, the Spaniard and the Swede were in a hole and they didn't get close to climbing out of it.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out of your hole.
The four-point and the four-quarters are interesting to watch because of the relationship between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and they are leading a bit at the start of the last day, but the quarter-finals have proven that the U.S. team has the ability to fight, something that some, especially in the U.S., doubted.
Europe ahead of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after finishing four balls and fours on Saturday 10-6 ahead of the US.
Incredible duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two wins over Tiger Woods to go and their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
European cricketer Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to regain the tie after losing it in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American bad tie in four balls the morning going and the series to 3-1.
The U.S. has raised more opposition in the four quarters, but they have not been able to get rid of the deficit.
Jim Furyk's cart needs eight points out of 12 individual games on a Sunday to keep the toll.
Fleetwood is the first European cricketer to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, who have been called "Molliwood" after an amazing weekend, are the second bar to get four points out of their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After graduating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they worked great together to beat Woods on the American Bryson Dechambeau rack of 5 and 4.
Cafod Wood, who slid himself two games on Saturday, had some special opportunities but lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and fours and seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who had retired for the ball's quarterfinals in the morning, returned as a partner to Henrik Stenson in the quartet and led by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka who are the world's first and third-highest in the world of 2 and 1.
It's been a long day in Europe and it's been a long day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They made a 2 and 1 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four balls and later made a 4 and 3 yuro Polter and Rory McIlroy in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history the team has come back from being four points behind at the start of the individual games, although only an equal score is needed on Furyk's garb as they are the holders of the trophy.
But, after being second for two days, coming after them on Sundays looks like it's beyond their ability.
North Korea says it won't be able to stand alone without confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said the United Nations' value of the ongoing sanctions is strengthening malice in the United States and the country will not be eliminated with its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the NWO's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant steps of goodwill" in the past year, in order to put an end to nuclear and nuclear drills, decommissioning and re-armament.
But we don't see such a response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can de-emphasize ourselves first."
Although Ri has reiterated complaints by North Korea's director of Washington's opposition to a gradual response to denuclearisation where its North Korea will be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statement was to see significant since he did not object to the paternal denuclearisation.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John Un and Donald Trum at the first conference between the current U.S. president and North Korean defector in Singapore on June 12, where Kim vowed to work towards "unnuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while restoring Trum.
North Korea has been trying to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused calls for tightening international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. is demanding 'de-nuclearisation first' and they are increasing the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve their goal in a compulsory manner, and they are even opposing the 'declaration to end the war,'" RI said.
"The creed that sanctions can conquer us is a dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that sanctions continue to strengthen our misconceptions."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a conference the president had convened in the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead, the minister pointed out the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five days and added: "If South Korea were the party to the issue of non-nuclearization and not the U.S., there would be no threat of nuclear deterrence.
However, Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a self-defeating target.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery taking steps to de-emphasize, but said there was a lot of work to be done again and that the sanctions must remain unchanged.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a specific period for this, saying "whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have argued that the United Nations General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must be strictly enforced and unfailingly enforced until we have verified and validated the inevitability.
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to try to limit the funding for Pyongyang's nuclear programs and facilities.
Ri met with Pompeo on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go as well.
Pyongyang left in July, saying there had been progress, but to North Korea accused him within hours of making "orders like a gangster."
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to denuclearize a site and a nuclear site if the U.S. takes "corresponding steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "responsible steps" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump swore in Singapore and moves towards normalizing the relationship with the United States.
Harvard students are given a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting its graduates to sleep more in order to try to tackle the mahogany culture of studying at night using caffeine.
Academics have found that students in the world's finest universities are often ignorant when it comes to the essentials of looking after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital who has designed the course, a course he believes is the first of its kind in the USA.
He was inspired at the beginning of the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only now getting to know this, in my final year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleep - it was a surprise to me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is presented for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, along with improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from a severe sleep deficiency during the week.
The hour-long course still contains a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficiency affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how a lack of sleep for a long time increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily practices.
“We are aware that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know what the impact of smoking is on your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to stay up through the night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a problem that is getting worse,
You should make sure that you get enough sleep, and that quality, is a way for students to cope with stress, fatigue and obsession, he said - even to avoid putting on pressure, since lack of sleep makes your brain believe that it is a good place to go.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical life, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after studying one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and had ‘inspired him to try to get the course for the whole campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study plan before joining the competitive organisation.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm for going to sleep, together and waking up, while being aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue lights' released by electronic screens and LED lights, which can affect your brain.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal beats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another bad game from home as Dolly Menga's goal led to a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's uncontacted team at Livingstone.
The Ibrox team had been looking for their first victory on the road since beating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt Gerrard's team knocked out for just the second time in 18 games as a manager to leave the eight-point team behind previous senior drivers.
Menga scored seven minutes ahead of half time and the Rangers team was short of inspiration and no vision of being able to come equal.
While Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingstone is rising to third only behind Hibernians on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after the Calum Spence technician had to have an injury treated to his head after something was thrown from the visitors' heads.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team and beat Father to reach the pre-final games of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt stayed with the 11 and beat Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his organized club defeated their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated in terms of possession but Livingstone did more with the waist when she had them.
They should have scored after just two minutes after Menga's pass gave Scott Pittman a chance on goal by Allan McGregor but the midfielder missed his chance by hitting the waist clearly.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep free kick in finding Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could not hit the clear at the back post.
The Rangers were in control, but there was more hope than they thought they would play in the final game.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have gotten a kick out of the smog after a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless hit but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombians' appeals.
Rangers got two shots for the target in the first half but found before goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's pitch and Ovie Ejaria's shot.
Although Livi's goal after 34 minutes has been against the running of the game, no one can argue that they were not worthy of their hard work alone.
Yet, the Rangers failed and dealt with Jacobs' deep play plans.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the bellows to Scott Robinson, who was discouraged by his passing to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard was like a brake as he switched Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change almost had an immediate effect as the defender switched to Morelos but Kelly rushed from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving the ball long after a long ball.
Holt's squad may have added to their score in the last few minutes but McGregor did well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow missed a goal from the corner.
Rangers second Glenn Middleton had another request for a kick from the smog after hitting Jacobs but Thomson ignored the request once again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger meter
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Birth": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and in numerals... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, a development that would eventually lead to a device called the Geiger Meter.
An important part of science since then, the Geiger Meter has also become an important part of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starring as highly unlikely scientists.
Man: "Where in the world is that?
Rogers: "Measurer Geiger, it's being used to find biodegradable minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that are released by the radiation in the minerals."

New cancer infection can teach the immune system to 'see' foreign cells
New cancer infection can teach the immune system to 'see' foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of a treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and adjusting them in a laboratory
Then they will be able to ‘see’ a protein that is common in multiple cancers and they will be re-injected
Testing of the vaccine shows hopeful outcomes in patients and different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw your ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and adapting them in a laboratory so that they can 'see' a protein called HER2 that is common in multiple cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovarian, squamous cell and spinal/cellular, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ them how to target cancer cells has worked to treat types of leukemia.
After his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began speaking in favor of Trump wearing a MAGA cap.
She didn't go well
Kanye West was beaten in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a hectic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing his third of that night, Ghost Town, wearing cop Make America Great Again, he ran against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I'll be talking to a white person and they'll say, 'How can you like Trump, he's from our race?
"Well, if I were worried about race, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star was making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before almost the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, a video from West was reportedly uploaded to social media by filmmaker Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West by posting it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been bullied behind the stage for what he was wearing on his head.
"They put me in the back of the building.
They said, 'Don't go outside with the cap on.'
They've been teasing me!
Then they say I'm in a low place," he said, after the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead: "Do you want to see the low place?" saying that it would "put my superman blog forward, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Make love to you."
His comments were buzzed at least twice by an SNL audience and the cast members were reluctant to see, Variety reported, with the same person saying to the announcement: "The studio all went completely quiet."
West had been added as a late second to singer Ariana Grande, as her former lover rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West caused confusion to many by performing the I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said: "To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCTION."
But actress Karen Hunter said West was just "being himself and that's great."
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "glove") who, in my opinion, cherishes and expresses ideas that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapist had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
He is with rapper, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the late musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Indicted for attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in Melfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in front of Belfast's Yadav Court on Monday.
The accusations will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington kills on poisonous masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed the stereotype of a macho hero, saying such roles on the screen mean young boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something's gone wrong" and questioned how to get to grips with the poisonous masculinity problem in the #MeToo episode.
Kit, who married all of his actresses on Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also at 31, recently admitted that he felt strongly about tackling the problem.
"I feel strong at the moment - what's gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
‘What have we been teaching people as they grow up, in terms of the problem we have now?’
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity and therefore because of the very masculine characters.
He went on to say, “What is it that is profitable and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys feel like they have to be a special kind of man?
In my opinion, that's one of the big questions of our lives - how do we change that?
"It's obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not do any other Game of Thrones programs when the series ends next summer, saying he had "enough on battles and horses."
From November, Kit will star in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing to come from Game of Thrones.
'I met a woman on the program, so in a way she gave me my family, and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow's character Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering.
About 40,000 new cases were identified in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the cases were handed down by gender, indicating a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood supplies.
But the number of people who catch HIV like this has been reduced to almost nothing, China's health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But, from year to year, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased from 100,000 people.
The transfer of HICV by sex is a major problem in China's LHDT community.
Its parity was decriminalized in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LHDT people is a rhyme.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases are due to inadequate sexual safety in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged general access to HIV medicine as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff released the data of Republican senators, killing 'dangerous lies' and 'conspirative deceptions'
On Saturday, Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff posted information about three Republican Senators to the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats said the allegations were being spread by "extreme right-wing" individuals.
"Truths, lies, and more lies," Walters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information spread online on Thursday, after being posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing by a panel of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh who is nominated to the Supreme Court.
The information was released after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and they released information to a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is false and a naked lie," Waters said.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised as a result of the fraudulent and erroneous allegations - was not responsible in any way for the release of this information.
This unfounded accusation is false and a naked lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by a former press secretary at the Ari Fleischer White House.
"It's annoying," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she doesn't have the nature to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't get angry.
They can't be insignificant.
They can't question the prosecution's motives.
They need to be calm and calm."
It appears that Fleischer compares Waters' response to the Democrats' condemnation of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by judges of appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had informed "the appropriate authorities and the agency to enforce the law of the fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the offenders are exposed," he said, "and that they are responsible for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - parody of a weak spy with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film that has a British twist and is suitable for this revival of the Johnny English comedy-preparation series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a way to make sure that we don't have the opportunity to create a new nation?
However, the no-glue Johnny English has been licensed to destroy everything back for the second time - with its name more than anything to show that it is a comic character that has been created for moviegoers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, the real spy who despite his honorable allegations included a little Clouseau, Mr Bean, on a man who was donating one note to by Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally based on the passenger and the secret man Atkinson played him in a Barclaycard ad, leaving destruction behind.
There is one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English film.
I was delighted to see Johnny English go towards a runner wearing a gun and the rotor blades hitting against his helmet.
Atkinson's dawn with physical comedy is to be seen, but the humor is weak and strangely unnecessary, especially now that "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedies as an element of their films.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's real misfortunes aren't as clever and specific as Atkinson's quiet jokes in the Bean mansion.
The idea is that Great Britain is in a big way.
A cyber hacker has migrated to Britain's secret network of spies, releasing the identity of all of Britain's spies in the field, despite the secretary's duty - an unfortunate and small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last step to a self-made chief minister who is self-righteous and surrounded, and who already suffers from enormous political turmoil. Emma Thompson does her best with the Mayan character Teresa but is great in the script to work with.
Her secret-knowledge advisers let her know that every spy has been compromised and that there will be some for her to come and someone out of retirement.
And this means Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher in some large organization now, but gives secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, as English holds a spy school similar to School of Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and has a meeting with his former partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is dispossessed.
So Batman and Robin get things wrong back at the service of His Majesty, coming across Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful fatal femme Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is busy being swept away by a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can deal with Britain's computer problems: Jason Vola is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous journey: dressed as waiters, they put a big French restaurant on fire; creating distress when trying to go on a luxury ship Volta; and English causing complete confusion when trying to use a virtually untrue tool to get rid of it.
They make a great show of it in the final scene, but although it's fun and unrealistic, there's a little bit of a sense of children's television about all of it.
It's very visible.
And as with the other Johnny English films I can't help but think: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes play with his talents?
The Labour Party denies that it is preparing a scheme for British people to work for four days a week but is paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical scheme that would mean that British people work four days a week - but are paid for five.
According to the statement, the party wants the heads of companies to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would mean that workers would get a weekend of three days - but get the same salary.
Sources say the idea would be consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country from the workers' side.
A four-day shift has been approved by the Labour Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day week is an ambition that coincides with the party's attitude towards restructuring the economy on the part of the workers as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at the moment, the ambition is not approved by all the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'A week of four days' work is not the party's policy and is of course not considered by the party.'
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to broaden his vision of a social revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from “anonymous directors” and “professors” of the public resource companies.
The opposition's chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies will not get all their money back as the Labour government could make 'decisions' on the basis of apparent malice.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and created Comprehensive Equity Funds to put 10 per cent of the equity of companies; the private sector in the hands of the workers, would have annual distributions of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" that the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question as to what the FBI's findings could cause any human-made Republican senator.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, Rep. Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham and the FBI could reveal something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called her after this happened, after the accusations came out, I said, ‘Can you do this?’
He was determined, determined, and unwavering."
However, Graham's vote is seen as strong.
"I have made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a terrible charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett completely denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one that she calls her can confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new happening."
What is the Global Citizenship Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizenship Day, an annual musical event that features an impressive list of stars and an equally striking message: eradicating poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizenship Festival will see tens of thousands of people march to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and also to raise awareness of the main intention of the festival's 20th anniversary.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Plan, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other valuable donation.
But how successful has the World Citizenship Day been with just 12 years after reaching its goal? - The World Citizenship Day
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way of persuading people to want change or just another case of "cliktivism" - people feel they are making a difference by signing an online petition or sending an email?
Since 2011, the Global Citizenship Festival says they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by their supporters, aiming at a variety of goals.
They say these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce $37 billion in commitments and policies that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and publications that were derived from their actions, with at least $10 billion of them having been classed or raised.
The group estimates that the funding that has been confirmed so far has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and practitioners who have committed to "helping children reach their full potential," promising to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate 47-plus deficiencies.
"With the help of the UK government, contributors, governments, and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice and lack of nutrition a footprint in history," said Tracey Ullman, 2018 The Power of Nutrition's ambassador, in a statement.
The group said the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with food, after over 5,000 actions have been called on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions and their website was asking "What makes you think we can get rid of extreme poverty?
"It's going to be a long and hard road - sometimes we'll fall and fail," he said.
But, as the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for "quarchae" to block Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to block energy from Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's intervention in Syria - specifically, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to deal with energy as much as they do in Eastern Europe, and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to get to grips with this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that the sea routes are open, and, if necessary, to place sieges, to make sure that these do not reach the market," he said.
Zinke greeted the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the voice of the energy user" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure and replace fuel," he said, noting that Russia's economy is completely dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump administration seeks to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest downstream option for consumers in Europe.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from a "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline plan that Trump says is making Berlin a "good" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly reiterated that only an economic project is the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 Billion and will double the current capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we share the belief that energy cannot be used to put pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
The U.S. Department of State has responded positively by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the U.S. to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider hard" applying for the presidency in 2020, said the Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider it hard" to apply for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After the 6th of November, I will consider applying hard for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried in my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been unbiased in his criticism of Trump and his nomination for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said: "Of course, we need an investigation by the FBI before voting."
But a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters don't believe she should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not stand behind the penultimate poll of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Policy Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported such an effort.
The pinion pole showed much more support for the effort by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting the possible effort and 48 percent against.
The other Democratic names that have been dubbed as potential candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said that he will officially decide by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD Track Palin in Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, suffered a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is suffering, what he is suffering from coming back, I can sympathize with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the pain that some of our soldiers are coming back with," he told an audience in a rally for Donald Trump.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and former soldiers, "they are coming back differently, they are coming back harder and they are coming back asking if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen have to offer.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assaulting a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and carrying a gun in his possession while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. supporting silence on the new refugee policy
Nineteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that prevents bullying for victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from the 18 states and DC made a brief introduction to a friend-of-the-law on Friday in Washington in support of a refugee seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News said.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, has not been disclosed.
He said that his partner "and his violent sons were members of a gang," had been treated but U.S. officials refused his application for asylum on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Nexas.
He described the turmoil of the state supporting Grace El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produces many asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries facing major problems with domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. refugee policy reverses a decision made in 2014 by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for housing if they fled domestic violence.
In a statement on Friday, the State Towers of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said the new policy was "ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that any application for housing be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such an impediment goes against that principle," the court's friend-y-llys said.
The twists made further arguments in the brief under the policy of banning entry for immigrants damaging the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and of "providing necessary work."
The Jeff Sessions National Tournament ordered that immigration judges do not give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang coercion in June.
"Refugees are available to individuals who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nation, or membership of a particular social group or political judgement," Sessions said in announcing the policy on June 11.
Refugees weren't meant to solve all the problems - even the serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts in Palu as double deaths in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly constrained.
"He feels very worried," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who was comforting her sick son in a vacuo center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances come and bodies come in.
The water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through their wet property, trying to save whatever they found for him.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the patients, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's military hospital, where they were being treated outdoors due to severe earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes as he talked about feeling the earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I got pushed to the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then calm down.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
"I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassment with 'propaganda announcements'
A week after one of China's new official papers ran a four-page ad in a daily new paper in the U.S. promoting trade interests between the U.S. and China, a U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press ad.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the addition of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most popular new paper - after accusing China of seeking interference in U.S. parliamentary elections on November 6, allegations that China denies.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections was a new step in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to impose trade-promoting notices, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting an increasing trade war that has led the two countries to impose tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that support the Trump Republican Party, experts from the US and China said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China is now confirming that bullying by running propaganda ads in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's important tradition of freedom of opinion and freedom of the press by placing a notice they have paid for in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Conversely, in the new paper stall down the street here in Beijing, you would find it difficult to find disagreeable voices and you would not see much reflection of the diverse ideas that people have about the economic path of China's preoccupied economy.
He added that "one of China's most prominent new papers has refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which paper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating women who vote before the Mid-Term Elections with Llanast Kavanaugh
As a number of leading Republicans support the nomination to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in terms of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, analysts have warned that they will see a response, especially by women, during the midterm elections.
The emotions around this have been very high, and the majority of Republicans on the record are already saying they want to go ahead with the vote.
You can't take these things back," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School at The Hill in an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (G-Arizona)'s last-minute effort to get an FBI investigation was enough to silence unhappy voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the advancing MoveOn group.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is a man coming!" as they protested in the senate court as the Republicans who run the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Ford Blaine.
"The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of Democrats is going to be immense," Stu Rothenburg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news website.
"People say they're enthusiastic already; that's true.
But it could increase, especially among uncertain women on the outskirts of towns and among young 18- to 29-year-old voters who, although not fond of the president, often do not vote."
Even before public testimony Ford described his allegations of sexual assault against the nomination to the Supreme Court, analyses suggested that there would be a strong response if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"This has evolved to be a complete mess for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republicans, early last week, according to NBC News.
"This is just about the vote of the committee or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and the way they've dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Democratic and Priorities, ISA.
But it seems that Americans are divided as to who to coil following Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with a little more on the side of Kavanaugh.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents are certain or against Ford's testimony, while 35% say they are certain or a similar stone believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believe it is certain that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's campaign, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford together with at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford took an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him while drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez tells Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, that her sexual organs were discovered while they were at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to start a new Internet in order to get to grips with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new project of the technology pioneer, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee denied that Inrupt's intention was to "manage the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional resources.
So that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and i with at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online data store is that it's up to the user who gets to see what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to Company Chief Executive John Bruce, is for the company to bring the appropriate resources, processes and skills to help ensure that Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteers.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers around the world could create deployed apps themselves using the resources available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change where their business models are completely overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's intention is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the accuracy and quality of the new web being created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the ambiguity of the internet.
After starting Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Consortium, and the Open Data Foundation.
"I'm very much looking forward to this next season in the history of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the clergyman of the Victorian Cross World War I
The only English clergyman to win the Victorian Cross as a fighter in the First World War has been celebrated in his native city 100 years later.
The Reverend Bernard Vanny won a prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had won Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two sons in transit in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his men, Michael Vann, said it was extremely symbolic that the stone was uncovered exactly 100 years after the match won the award to his father.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1928, the Upper Vann led its fatality across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick clouds and attacks by field energies and engines."
Later he rushed to the raffle line and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before rushing to a white field on his own and loading three of the crew.
Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I can never compare but that is subordinate to someone."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann set a torch after the event, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to be part of the transition" adding "that the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by so many people."
MMA fans stayed on their feet all night to watch Bellator 206, they found Peppa Pink in his place
Imagine this, you've stayed on your feet all night to watch Bellator 206 just to be banned from watching the main show.
The event from San Jose consisted of 13 horns, including a church on the main card and was shown live through the goal in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other, the viewers in the UK were left amazed as the screen switched to Peppa Pink.
Some were unhappy at the fact that they stayed on their feet all night especially to watch the ornament.
One supporter on Twitter described the change to children's cartoons as "some kind of bad joke."
"Government regulations said the content was not suitable after 6 a.m. so children's programs had to change," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Bring the pig," he said.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will work on their schedule as it includes UK observers in the future.
"I think when I think about the re-show, that we can make it work," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning there on Sunday and we won't be able to deal with this until it's Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the programs made a change, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the problem, it was a government issue.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We'll have to keep it to five horns instead of six - as usual - we tried to give too much to the fans and it ran for a long time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was feeling ‘religious’ because of his sexuality
Plummer Tom Daley says he has grown up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this has encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old walker said he hadn't realized until he went to high school "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent has made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-established program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up "because she wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "Today, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling differently, have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they came to know about his sexuality.
The swimmer who has won the Olympic bronze medal twice has become a prominent LHDT campaigner who used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more non-compliance-conflicting countries.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without conditions and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world champion said falling in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was unexpected."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than, last year but said the age gap has never been a problem.
"When someone goes through so much very young" he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - she said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had lived through hot spots and low points.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more things than winning Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal in the Olympics is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be around to be in the front row'," he said.
"I grabbed his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and he was dead did I admit that he was not of our invincibility," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I'd dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd at home in the Olympics, there wasn't a better feeling," she said.
He also inspired his first-ever choice - Proud by Heather Small - who had tuned in before the Olympics and was still giving him an eye-catching skin.

Mickelson, who is not at his best on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phill Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his standard to avoid getting an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the 12th time, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the four-head and four-quarter games.
Rather than being in the middle of the activity, as has been so often in the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, shared his day between being a supporter and working on his game in the hope of improving the problems he has.
Since the seventh driver was not even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not a good choice for a Le Golf National draw course, where the long rough punishes roving shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickleson, in Sunday's ninth game, faces the right-handed champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win each of their four months of the game.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 singles game, get a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely essential.
He showed confidence in his man, although he could do nothing else.
"He understood the role he had today, kicked my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't know he was going to play two games.
I was expecting more, but then she had worked out and then we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached high places on its own.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk says his presence is an unfavorable boost to the team.
"He's serious, sarcastic, frank, he likes to make fun of people's heads, he's a great person to get in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players having fun making fun of his head, too, this week, was nice to see.
It's much more than just a scam."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big advantages can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of individual games in the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable trip.
The Danish won their first game at Valderrama in 1997, where a team captained by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but by the finish line the advantage down to a draw with Europe had won from 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
Remember for yourself that we have a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we've won, and in Valderrama, where we've won only from a narrow margin," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 National Golf Days on Friday.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You have to do your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win the prize, and that's where we will focus.
I've said since the beginning, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our club, but we're also aware of what that stands for - the best players in the world."
He was delighted with the way his players have performed on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be great at this.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come forward, and that's a completely different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, you're being experienced to the utmost as a golfer.
This is the message you need to give to the players, that is, do your best tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too."
Unlike Bjorn, American captain Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, aside from Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk has been on both fronts in the big wins on the last day, as he was part of the team that won at Brookline before losing after Europe secured the "Worth in Medinah."
"I remember every word of it," he said after being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gave his players a boost before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to start fast as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When the momentum goes in one way, it puts a lot of emphasis on those games in the middle.
"We're putting our line like that and putting the men out as we want, we're trying to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the order.
"I'm with this group of players in this order because I believe they will work well all the way," Bjorn said of his choice for the individual games.
Germany's new warship deferred once again
A new German navy fleet should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War, but will not be available until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media said.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a new Die Zeit paper referring to a spokesman for the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery have plagued the popularity of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class vessels commissioned by the Naval Service in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
According to the report, they will include a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship shells along with some secretive technologies, such as radar signature, sub-red and lower sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance and retention periods - the new cookies should be able to be stored for up to two years away from their home ports.
But continued delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which will allow 'Germany to throw its power over the sea - will after the age by which they will begin to serve, Die Zeit said.
The F125 was in the headlines last year, after the German Lynges refused to commission the ship and return it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship had returned to the ship's builders after it was delivered.
The reasons behind the ship's return were unclear, but Germany's media referred to a number of essential "software and hardware deficiencies" that meant the warship would be useless if it had to fight.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the numbers on the Bremen class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship's overweight strength is exacerbating its performance and diminishing the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be 7,000 tons twice as expensive as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the deficient hardware, the price for the entire project - including the training of the crew - is starting to be a problem.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1bn ($3.6bn) - up from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2bn initially.
The problems of the new frigates have never become more important given the recent warnings that Germany's naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy was "running out of ships that can be convinced."
The official said the problem had worsened over time, as old ships had been decommissioned without new ships being provided in their place.
He believed that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Marines.
The National Trust listens to the secret lives of the yesteryear
New research is being done at a stop in Scotland's Highlands trying to uncover how the band uses the landscape to hunt for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique mammals and will help with conservation activities in the future.
The study by Scottish National Trust scientists will follow the least common symphony on the soprano symphony along with the elongated symphony and the water symphony in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the site in order to keep an eye on the band's activity throughout the season.
Volunteers and NHS staff will also carry out mobile inspections using handheld sensors.
A specialist sound analysis of the recordings will find out the frequency of the band's calls and what kinds of do what.
Then a report and map will be generated in order to create a detailed landscape size picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Consultant of the Scottish National Trust, hopes that the results will show which species are most important to the band and how they are used by each species.
The information will help determine the advantages of cabin management work such as creating docks and how to manage forests for cattle and other related species.
The populations of people living in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their crops and leads to loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also be dangerous, along with insect-catch paper and some chemicals in building materials, and attacks by cats.
Tulips aren't blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching their food.
They use sophisticated eco-locating technology to see the hurdles and obstacles ahead of them.
Scotland's National Trust owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and over 76,000 hectares across the country and they are deeply concerned about the faction.
They have ten trained specialists, who conduct constant surveys, visits to clubs and occasional savings.
The organisation has established Scotland's first band guard at Threave Stop in Dumfries and Galloway, its home to eight of Scotland's ten bands.
State manager David Thompson said the landscape of the state was perfect for them.
"We've got a great area for a team," he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good stuff.
But there are a lot of things we don't know about cohorts, so the work we do here and on other sites will help us to understand more about what is needed so that people can thrive."
It emphasizes the search for a gang before doing any maintenance work in buildings as the destruction of one gang could kill up to 400 female and young gangs, possibly killing all the local population.
A band is protected and it is illegal to kill, upset or destroy them or destroy their wounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the official of the Scottish Ystlumod Conservation Trust, has been urging the public to help.
He said: "We have a lot to learn about our hystlom and with many of our species we don't know if their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo disregards allegations of rape as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape against him "fake news," saying people "demand to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been charged with harassing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a white Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were announced, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news."
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
What they say today, fake news," said his player, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, allegations they have called "an unacceptable report of doubts in a private matter," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "a moral misdemeanor that is equivalent to the severity of the crime, which is likely to be one of the most serious personal rights offences in recent years."
The event is said to take place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to be returning to the player's room, where he was routinely drafted, according to the papers presented to Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that "99 the can" was a "good man" who was disappointed by the "one the hundred".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that they had sex, but he is consensual.
Mayorga says she went to the police and that pictures had been taken of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an arrangement outside the court because she was "fearful of revenge" and worried about "being embarrassed."
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to reverse the arrangement as she continued to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from the United States when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he moved to the Italian side Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK would regret losing car makers forever
The UK would "regret forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
She added that it was "brilliant" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would stop producing temporary cars at its factory in Burnaston near Derby if the UK left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clarke said.
The automaker from Japan said delays at the border could lead to job losses if no deal was made.
The factory in Burnaston - which builds Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year and almost 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain fell out of the EU at the end of March, construction would stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised concerns about the impact that leaving the EU without a deal will have on trade across the border, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said they will close their Mini factory in Rhydychen for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what the car makers say are the risks in the supply chain if there is no Brexit deal.
Toyota's production line runs on a "only in time" basis, with chunks reaching every 37 minutes by suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars that are being built on order.
If the UK left the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, problems the industry says would lead to delays and a lack of fragments.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so it would have to put a limit on the construction.
Mr Clarke said that Chequers' Theresa May plan for the relationship with the EU in the future "is carefully crafted to avoid those border checks."
We need a deal. We want to get the best deal that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity," he told Today on Radio 4.
"The testimony from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of achievement chains that have been very successful."
Toyota could not say how long the production work would end, but in the long run, it warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and would ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union assembler in the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "From my experience once these jobs have gone, they are not coming back.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have come up with a detailed and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting is likely to be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's important meeting with deputy Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" as the fight for the nomination for the top Brett Kavanaugh Palace continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, connections between Trump's aides and Russia and obstructing possible justice by the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss the deputy prime minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been on Washington's mind for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of getting rid of the president by using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein dismissed the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, saying he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said it would be "better for him not to" fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
He said of the meeting with Rosenstein: "There is no date set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that being postponed for another week because of all the other things that happen in the top court.
But we'll see and I'll always like to give the latest information to the press."
Some reporters would be suspicious of that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said there was no reluctance to "orchestrate" television journalists for the lack of briefing, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are overcrowding."
He then suggested that the direct link between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president is doing more Question and Answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without citing any evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
Sanders said the briefing would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the U.S. president, that's much better than talking with me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks, and this will happen instead of holding a press conference where you can talk to the U.S. president."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or when he takes part in open sessions or press conferences with important attendees.
There is a shortage of individual press conferences.
In New York this week, the president showed why, while making a bold and odd appearance at times in front of correspondents.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in Scotland's NHS due to concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express their appreciation in the country, wishing them to remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months to leave until the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay for the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working for the decommissioned public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, and decisions are expected to be made in the fall.
But the UK government has also been stepping up preparations for the possibility of a ‘no-deal’ situation.
I'm sure this time will be an unprecedented one for all of you.
That's why I want to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and provide benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
It's your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery soon after being injured in the head
Abercrombie, who plays for Tennessee State's Deigrod, has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury as the team lost against the Vanderbilt Comodoros from 31 points to 27 on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessee team.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Rees told reporters that the injury had happened a while ago.
"He came to the sideline and some kind of fall there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and escorting him back for further assessment.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury or how bad the injury is again" and the Tennessee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year red shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
Five tackles were all scored on Saturday before having to leave the game. That brought the total of tackles of the season to 18.
Buyers from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to support the homeless under new schemes by the Torys.
This proposal will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp tax will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects him to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and the additional money will be used to support the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and target those who earn high wages.
The increase in stamp tax will be passed on to individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK. The additional money will encourage the Government's intention to deal with people who are sleeping out.
The surcharge - which is additional to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased-to-install - may be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this offer to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is believed that 13 percent of brand new properties in London are bought by residents from outside the UK, and this raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to step on the house school.
Many of the country's wealthy areas - especially in the capital - have turned into "desert towns" because so many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to stop forcing affordable homes to repair the "quarty houses" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an impressive series of planned housing renovations, including rent management and ending the transformation of people from their "faultless" homes.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year, I said that I would devote my work as prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life would improve for every new generation.
That's why we need to rebuild our home market.
The UK will always open its doors to people who want to live, work and create a life here."
However, it may not be right to buy homes as easily for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies that are located abroad, as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house is far from within reach, and the shame of sleeping on the street continues to be far too real."
Jack Ross: "My ambition in the end is to govern Scotland."
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "high ambition at the end" is to be the Scottish team manager.
The 42-year-old Scottishman faces the challenge of reviving the North-West club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scotland's Higher League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-cap and that's it," Ross told Sportssound, Scotland's BBC programme.
"When I was a child, I grew up watching the Scottish in Hampden a lot with my father, and it's something that has never brought me back.
That's the only way I'm going to be able to do that, if I'm successful in managing a club."
Ross's predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he wasn't afraid to follow such strong names in such a big club, and he has rejected previous proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich.
"At this point in time, I'll be able to see if I can lead this club back to the Upper League."
Due to the structure and facilities of the club, it belongs to the Upper League without fail," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself successful unless we could get the club back there."
Only three years have passed since Ross started his career as a manager, having served as a deputy manager in Dumbarton and a 15-month period as one of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then it helped to raise Alloa after they descended to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from descending tier to being at the top of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It's probably a bit of an odd point," he said, recalling taking the avenues in Alloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the right career for me, more so than being a player.
It sounds odd because I did it right, I made a reasonable living out of it, and I made a few to the pinnacle.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things to do weekly.
I'm still going through that in the stress and pressure of work, but the management feels right.
I've always wanted to be a manager and since I've realized that, I'm now more satisfied with my world than ever."

The perfect time for a dock is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday night, according to a survey.
The hot summer weather has given a boost to the gains of Britain's bars that are hard to find, but it has put more emphasis on food chains.
Groups of bars and pubs saw an increase of 2.7 per cent in sales in July - but a decrease of 4.8 per cent in food house earnings, according to figures.
Peter Martin of CGA's business consulting firm said: "Because the hot weather has continued, and England has stayed in the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern quite similar to that of June that was at July 8, where the second quarter saw a slower pace.
After the drop of 1.8 percent in the home-eating trade in June, things went from bad to worse in July.
Taverns and bars selling drinks performed best seeing more growth than homes seeing food loss.
He suffered from restaurants that focused on selling food because of the sun, too, although not as much as the people running food houses.
It's like going out for a drink that people just want to do.
Throughout the pubs and bars that are managed, there was an increase of 6.6 per cent in the sales of drinks for the month, while there was a decrease of three per cent in food."
Paul Newman of RSM's leisure and hospitality analysis company said: "These results show a continuation in the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social events or in the world of sports continue to be the main factors in terms of sales in the market outside of the home.
It's no surprise that eating groups continue to suffer, although a drop of 4.8 per cent year on year will certainly be distressing as well as ongoing cost pressures.
"The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for people running food houses that focus on selling food, and time will show that a more moderate temperature in August will give some of the rest it really needs."
In July, there was an increase of 2.7 per cent in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones opened. This reflected the slowdown in introducing new brands.

One out of every five children has hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school pupils showed that there was an increase in "false Insta" pages.
The news has exacerbated the concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the pupils said they had a "brief" account to show to their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 years old - create social media accounts they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school pupils has shown a rapid rise in "Fake Insta" accounts - referring to an Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has exacerbated the concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the pupils said they had a "brief" account suitable to show to parents, while they also had some private ones.
One mother came across a hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter and saw a child in her teens encouraging others to "correct me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and Private Teachers' Conference (HMC) independent schools, has found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It is worrying that so many children in their teens are tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers can't find them."
Doyle will be the "athlete's voice" on the Scottish Athlete's board.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Mr Doyle has been elected to be on the board of Scottish Athletes as non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and chair Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for those who lead the campaign to benefit from the wide range of experiences she has at the international level over the decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected across the community of Scottish, UK and world athletes, and we are sure that Scottish athletes would greatly benefit from having him on the table," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice for athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the campaign in Scotland."
The American won the 200m and 400m race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics on top of the other four Olympic gold medals he has, and he is now a regular loser on the BBC, but was unable to walk after suffering a temporary ischemia stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today I found myself in a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's time to tell if I'm getting better or to what extent I'm getting better.
It's been a killing but I've completely improved, I've learned how to walk again and today I'm doing exercises for weight loss!
"Thank you for all the encouragement!"
There's a variety of opinions online about a pump ad that almost compares mothers to cattle
A variety of online opinion is the result of an advertisement by a pump company that compares cattle-feeding mothers being raised.
To mark the launch of what is known as the "first almost silent pump in the world that can be worn first," the technical goods company Elvie has released a cellulose ad in the form of a musical video to show the freedom that the new pump can give to its mothers.
There are four real mothers dancing in a shed of grass and cattle, to a dragon that contains words such as: "Yes, I'm uplifting myself, but you don't see a tail" and "I'm afraid you didn't notice, not pearls."
"Pump out, pump out, I'm feeding the baby, I'm pumping out, I'm pumping out, I'm lifting the bbq."
However, the ad, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been an online burning topic.
With 77,000 people watching the video and hundreds of comments, it has received a mixed response among viewers, with some saying it is not seriously "misleading" the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision when using cattle to advertise this product."
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are being stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
Almost Elvie's pump fits nicely and from the inside look into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mam)
Another said: "It is understandable that this is a tragedy for the mother and the baby.
Why don't you use them to advertise pumps almost to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "An advertisement that doesn't understand the world that belongs to it."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she saw the song as "overwhelming."
"This is a great idea.
I would have had one if I had still eaten from the chest.
It made me feel like a bully.
The ad is a bit hurtful but I did take it for what it was.
"This is a great book," wrote one of the
Another said: "This is a full-fledged advertisement aimed at moms who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like "four."
I don't want to criticize or praise the quality of the product."
At the end of the video, the group of girls reveal that they have been dancing with the pumps hidden in their arms.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who pump from the breasts feel like cattle.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits perfectly inside a nursing bra. This gives the freedom for girls to move, to grab their babies, and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director Mother, said: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and focused launch.
By showing a similarity between breast pumping and breast pumping cattle we wanted to draw attention to pumping the breast and all its challenges, showing the incredible freedom that comes from the new pump in a gentle and relevant way.
This isn't the first time Elvis has made it to the top of the list.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two of her children appeared on stage to the designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of Children Moved Silently to Camp on the Texas Border
The number of mobile children being kept from fleeing has suddenly increased although the numbers crossing the border each month have not changed much. This is partly due to the stringent policies and policies introduced by the Trump administration making it difficult to set up children.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been immigrants themselves without the right to be in the country, and they have been concerned about jeopardizing their right to stay in the country as they move on to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the provision of donors and other adults in the house would require fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor underage children without a company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those who were arrested had a criminal record.
"Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are patrons or members of the same house with patrons, live in the country illegally, and a large number of those are foreign offenders.
So we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of being held, rather than after 60 days, which was usually earlier, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by video conferencing, rather than personally, to plead their case for legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those who are considered unfit to receive assistance will be dispatched from the country without delay.
According to shelter workers and reports that have appeared from the system in recent months, the longer children will remain in detention, the more likely they are to feel anxious or low-minded. This can lead to violent bullying or attempting to escape.
Advocates say such worries are worse in a larger facility like Tornillo, where there are signs that a child suffering can be ignored, due to its size.
It was added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many are fighting against.
Syria is urging "lights that have been seized" by the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, an excuse to fight terrorism, and they will "treat them appropriately."
"They have to be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem said "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more being rooted out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces from Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers treading the country that has been destroyed by war.
Speaking of refugees, Moualem said the circumstances were right for them to return, and blamed "a number of Western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that encouraged refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the process of their return," he said.
"They've made a completely humane matter a political matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no rebuilding aid to Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition puts an end to the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a cluster zone in Idlib's last important rebel conclave has created an opportunity to push ahead with political talks.
Under the agreement between Russia and Turkey, it was possible to avoid a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "permanent time limits" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, which will "get them destroyed."
With this, Staffan de Mistura, the UN ambassador, hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee that will include members of the government and opponents to draft a post-war composition for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Moualem imposed conditions for the Syrian government to take part in the committee, saying the panel's work would "review the current articles of the composition," and warned them of interference.
Why does Trump want to win a second term?
That being said, Mr. Trump could be elected in 2020 unless, as many of the liberals hope, he is certain, a high-profile and scandalous end to his presidency soon.
And that would, without a doubt, be the "most dramatic ending to a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs that the watchers are tired.
Since 2014, peak hours figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" program has outperformed cable TV figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on new nights.
"This is a text that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, a programmer for the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," referring to a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the capital.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There's fun in the middle of the mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, and can bring immigrant families back together, and the state of the global economy.
Only the most respected viewers have the ability to turn off the TV.
And yet, he's now going to be a disgraceful citizen when you realize that you're on the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of the words "intensive background" as he tracks information for his book, Paul's short "silence" (silence).
I'm not going to be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes you feel like it's like a reality show is that it's feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Wheelhouse Entertainment's chief executive and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the Trump program's characters.
You can't afford to miss a single chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside his home on Kauai's northern shore, but he had sneaked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave the screen, not with Brett Kavanaugh at the end of facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the spotlight.
"I remember when we were doing all the crazy programs back then for a long time and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end for the liberation of the West,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but the truth about it is that they're right."

Money from the outside flows to the mid-term electoral races in the House
It's no surprise that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the re-forming of council districts which means that two senators are in the race for the same seat.
The recently redesignated Pittsburgh metropolitan area favors Conor Lamb who is a Democrat - who won his seat in another region in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another builder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th region in Pennsylvania, which is somewhat overlapping with the new 17th region.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old regions were unjustly unconstitutional in the Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th region has sparked a campaign finance battle between the major parties' finance branches, the Democratic Campaign Committee of the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a competition that garnered a lot of attention in March in a special election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The Republican had held the seat for over a decade, and President Trump won the region by 20 points.
The Democrats say the Democrats are on the front lines.
The U.D. is considering punishing El Salvador for giving support to China, then withdrawing
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much unfavourable response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heated meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Banama in June 2017. He had a guest in Mahanama until partners turned the Trump Foundation management team out.
State Department officials decided to call the heads of diplomatic missions back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Phanama because of the "recent decisions to refuse to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, in a statement earlier this month.
Sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, which included drug management, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to targeted financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been worrying for the Central American country and its high rate of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings moved forward, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference that focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar meeting that was held last year that was considered to be a misunderstanding by non-members.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials explained that they wanted the conference to go ahead, thus ending any consideration of punishing El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence had been auditioned to address the conference, which was scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting.
And the three ambassadors from America quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any difficult new messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton declined to provide details of the dispute described by the three U.S. officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to speak about the internal negotiations on the condition that they were unknown.
The reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration who also spoke on the condition that it was unknown to us.

It is possible that the next big event will be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possibility that Mr Trump has blocked justice, where there is now substantial evidence in public records.
According to him, Mr. Mueller's report also discusses Mr. Trump's campaign to conspire with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability to that body, and he is prepared to go before voters once again, and perhaps a judge of his peers in the long run.
There's a lot of uncertainty about that, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor his counterparts in Europe.
We all need to make choices on the side of the West that will have an impact throughout the endeavours.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West but had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of achievement that has been.
The course of history revolves around such shaping points, and the journey of democracy's undoing is accelerated or hammered.
Americans are facing many of these shaping points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump dismisses the Deputy Prime Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who manages Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep waters ever since this paper reported last year, that he had suggested recording the president secretly and reasoning that he was unsuitable for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
"How will we respond if the new F.B.I. inquiry asked Brett Kavanaugh is neither full nor fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite allegations of credible sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
Are we going to vote in the mid-term elections in favour of the House that will hold Mr Trump accountable?
If we fail that test, it will be difficult for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Mgr<0xC3><0xA5>g.
A Jew from Czechoslovakia was my mother who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi organization that once owned my parliamentary home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to illuminate the Sabbath candles on the table that showed the swastika.
And that's part of my legacy, how can I not be hopeful for the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team is faithful before playing against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians, will follow the equal match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, meaning they are in a good position to qualify from Group G League.
His injury to his head meant that Graham Dorrans wasn't able to play this season until the equal 2-2 game with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to achieve great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
We started the game with the thought that we could get something from there and we came up with a point.
Maybe we could have beaten in the end but, overall, a match equal was a fair result more than likely.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
On Thursday night, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but that will be difficult because they got a good result in their final game. But, with the crowd supporting us, I'm sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely challenging, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made in the club itself, but there's a nice feeling in the place now.
It's a good game, and the kids are enjoying it; it's a good game.
Hopefully we can keep going now, forgetting about the last season and succeeding."
Women are losing sleep because of this fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that those who took part in the survey had a good idea of the way they wanted to be cared for, only a few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the individuals in a Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouse about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a member of the family to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is where it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't let them know about your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, because those choices can be important factors in determining the cost.
You should include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you think about a way to pay for those costs as well.
Your choices in long-term care funding can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid value-money life insurance policy to pay for those costs or self-assessment with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Develop your legal documents: Prevent legal battles.
Make sure that you have a health care broccoli so that you appoint a person you trust to supervise your medical care to make sure that professionals comply with your wishes so that you are not able to communicate.
Also, you should consider an appeal for your financial matters.
You would choose the person you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are able to do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's about more than financial matters, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?"
Who's going to take care of the dog?

A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which occurred around 02.30 BST, as "random action."
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries do not endanger his life and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that ravaged the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to officials, with the number of deaths likely to rise.
With connections broken, rescue officers have not been able to get any information from Donggala's leadership, an area in northern Palu that is closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake supercentre.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been displaced after the earthquake struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the state capital of the Sulawesi Central District, at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population target of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami broke out.
Donggala is a forecast that extends along more than 300km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The project, an administrative area under the state, had a population target of 299.200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic operators of the Central Sulawesi District, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the county, but most of that work takes place in Morowali, on the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Liniary Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Sea's seismic Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the state of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of those were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A Pidie Jaya earthquake struck in Aceh, causing devastation and terror as people were reminded of the lanast of the earthquake and the dangerous tsunami in 2004.
The tsunami was not caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings falling.
2018: Large earthquakes struck Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily trapped there.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and deputy-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, alleging domestic violence and denying the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a woman's confessor tried to call the police to inform them of the alleged crimes, he took his phone off him.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su Concert Facility and is detained on an unsecured $500 fund, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "dumb, definitely" when asked where he was, according to the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A misconduct, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and face a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with Class B misconduct, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being brought before the Alaska Ex-Soldiers Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, contempt for reporting the crime of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
Her lover said she had put a pin in her face.
Sarah Pilan was convicted by ex-military groups in 2016 after linking her son's dangerous behavior with PTSD that stems from his time serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Cannons killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the Sulawesi district, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are shared on social media, indicating the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck on the shore.
Federal prosecutors call for the utmost punishment for the man who is suspected of carrying out the horrific attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the utmost punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of the horrific attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused by Home Depot of using a rental thrust to attack a bike path along the West Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the utmost punishment, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight individuals "intentionally" and caused serious bodily injury "intentionally", according to the warning of intent to seek the utmost punishment, which has been imposed.
The two of them have the right to be punished, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipov with 22 counts of detention which included eight counts of murder for fraud, charges that are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of imprisonment and crimes against humanity.
Prosecutors said the attack called for "substantial premeditation and planning," describing the Saipov attack as one "ugly, cruel and corrupt."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego's families and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from the city.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York introduced the most severe punishment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was immediately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the sentence was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of plotting to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union.
Both of them were put to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the statement.
He also asked to have an ISIS flag in his room in the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment, which included 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defenders who represented Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the utmost punishment rather than accept a guilty plea for life in prison without the possibility of being released only extends the trauma of these events to everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked the prosecution not to try the penalty quite.
As Tor<0xC3><0xAF>aidd says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to "act on the voice of the people" during a protest at the Dorian conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptic members - as one of Theresa May's own spokeswomen suggested she should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
In the passage in Birmingham, Peter Bone, one of the Conservative members of the backstrokes, said the UK would 'go out' by now if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in revamping her highly-exploded ranks is based on Dorians who are in favor of Aros joining another protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to keep up with his Chequers plan amid attacks by people in favour of Brexit, those in favour of Aros and the European Union.
Allies have demanded that she will continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the crackdown - forcing Eurosceptic and Labour members to choose between her package and her 'deal'.
Mr Bone said in the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to ‘throw Chequers’.
He suggested that he should have made Mr Farage a gentleman and given him the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If we had been responsible, we would have gone out by now,” he said.
As Wellingborough added: 'I will stand in favour of Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.'
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be second.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone ignored suggestions that noted that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain completely wrong.’
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory member in favour of Brexit, was also in the process of saying to officials: ‘I say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is not popular among the public, the Verts are not going to vote in favour of the scheme, it is unpopular among our party and our active members who walk the streets to choose us in the first place.
"Don't listen to the cheeks and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, he added: ‘Chief ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Farage told the rally that politicians must "feel the pressure" if they wanted to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, 'We won't let you do that.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel that pressure.
"We are acting on the voice of the people of the country who secured our victory in Brexit and we will continue to do so until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, people who are in favour of staying through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A handful of activists waved Tory flags against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
One of the Labour Lords, Lord Adoins, made fun of the head of the Guardians because of the security issues they had with the party's app as the conference opened.
"The people who tell us they can have IT systems in their place and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
“It’s a complete mess.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Seriously, I'm going to take the job of the President
Elizabeth Warren, one of the U.S. senators, says she will "look closely at applying to become president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe says the Democrat from Massachusetts has spoken about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the state representative on behalf of the GOP, who co-chaired the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign.
There has been a lot of speculation that she could compete against Trump in 2020.
At the Holyoke event on Saturday afternoon, she met with voters for the 36th time using the city hall format since Trump took office.
He asked her if she was going to stand up for the president's office.
Warren said it was "time for girls to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a girl on the top."
Arrested after Sims of LSU were shot to death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that someone had been arrested on suspicion of shooting Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, to the death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference at 11am.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man who was seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the University of the South campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died immediately as a result," Murphy J. Paul, one of the top police officers, told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being on the scene, possessing a weapon, and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an investigation and was placed in detention at the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 6-foot, 6-inch boy who grew up in Baton Rouge. He had played in 32 games starting 10 of them last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 opponents of the game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the order of the team helped him to win the lead over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team arrangement would play a big part in the race.
From the post, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to the first pool leaving Hamilton to reach the traffic at the end of the pack, something that should have been oath-taking.
The Mercedes went to the lap pool later by coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after coming to himself and saw the Ferrari driver, dissatisfied, leaving the inside free in danger of being caught going after a double move to defend the corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he proceeded in his quest to try to finish quickly and passed Kimi Raikkonen to secure the fourth place.
Eventually he came to the pits on lap 44 but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came to fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has done great throughout the weekend and he was a gentleman letting me pass.
The team has done a great job of getting one and two," said Hamilton.
That's a good body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday for insisting she didn't share the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in North Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Rather, he said that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are "good and sad."
"The same thing that could happen and the blessed thing that has been going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who hate and are evil and are liars," he said.
"When you look at the statements and the documents that are shared and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do I remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember his answer... you shared the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, naddo.
I didn't share the document."
Well, wait a minute.
"We're not going to do it, we're not going to do it," he added, mocking the senator.
Feinstein's letter contained details of the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and was shared early in September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't share his story," Feinstein told the committee.
She asked me to keep the letter confidential and I did it as she was asked."
But it didn't seem that the president believed him, and he made a remark during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you something, his body language was very poor.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's nomination, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three daughters, the president suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own concerns.
"They're determined to take the power back in any way that's necessary.
You see the hatred, the misfortune, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to get power and control," the president said.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made a big loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won the lead early as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to level the home team's score before Dwyer regained the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard leveled the score for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third time Adam Keefe have lost in the Elite League this season, a team that had unexpectedly beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth time the teams met this season, with the Giants beating the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford helping as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped provide Cownie an equal goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the front in the first half as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reopened and, once again, Bouchard made sure they had an equal score with a powerful goal for 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee forward for the first time in the game late in the second period and secured the victory by scoring his team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of people on a plane can escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being called a hero after he dies, ensuring that the plane carries hundreds of people safely from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks still strike the area and many are in rubble in the city of Palu.
But while his co-workers have fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at the highly enclosed control tower at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the run at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia said.
We had prepared a trainer from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be transported to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost it this morning before the coach arrived at Palu.
"Hearing the news is shocking," he said.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the disaster relief agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
It's likely that the number is still rising because many bodies are still under the rubble and many bodies we haven't reached yet," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached six meters have collapsed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes bring assistance and supplies to the country.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances bring bodies here every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
"People are going to take out the small supermarkets everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesia Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
The situation is already catastrophic, but it could go much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to moving and shipping.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, causing 550 deaths.
Airplane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crashes in a lagoon
The airline that flew an aircraft that fell into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that one man is missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and the entire crew have managed to leave the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen a man on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man, according to the report.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airfield.
Officials say seven people have been taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said that six people were still in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and how exactly it happened.
The U.S. Navy and Air Force said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had crossed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane had flown in very low.
"That's a good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to walk through water to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He said the plane's personnel were shocked and screaming, and that he had been slightly injured in the head.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers were working to improve nearby docks and had helped rescue people by using a wind boat to carry people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in plane crashes that have registered with PNG in the last two decades but none of them included Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the timetable of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution filed its case on Saturday against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He outlined to the court how he used mobile phone records to create a full picture of the moves of the 29-year-old defender, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she had got location data from many mobile phones that showed Tellis with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting her previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his mobile phone with Chambers' mobile phone during the time he had said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was Sanford's mule that night, Sanford said he was "saying a lie, because my mule was in Nashville."
Another misconception was that Tellis had said she had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records showed that they had only known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from her phone sometime after her death.
"He took it out of his life," he said.
The defendant will start his arguments on Sunday night.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to go to the court later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio aims to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Fryste, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots, i.e. political messages and is dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to those roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a new wave of support in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.

New York's Nani prosecutes a couple for dismissing her following a "helpful" text message
Nani in New York prosecutes a couple for discriminating against her and dismissing her after she receives a text message that has been misdirected by her mother complaining that she is "a different person."
The couple denies that they are racial, saying the situation is as if someone is "trying to profit."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was disappointed when she saw that the childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "anonymous," fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their old grandmother, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and that she was instead expected to return to New York.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for being fired, and she is trying to get compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work with accommodation she had been hired to do initially, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do things like that," he said to the Friday Post, adding, "I know this is a case of discrimination."
The couple have condemned the allegations as racial, saying that ending Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, as they were worried they couldn't trust him after he got angry.
"My wife sent me something that she didn't want to say.
She's not racial.
We are not racial people," the man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the care of someone you've been unkind to them, even if that was a mistake?
"Your newborn baby?"
I don't think."
Comparing the legal case to "a situation of someone trying to profit," Plasco said his wife is expecting a baby within two weeks and that she is in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to be chasing someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the banker said.
Although the legal case is still pending, it was a long time before the court of public opinion condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers fear readers would unite with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to step into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
Now, it's very sad to know what we know about Paddington's tremendous success."
He said his father, who had been working as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a ten-year-old bear, would have accepted the matter if his work had been rejected, but added that celebrating 60 years since the publication of the book was "very popular."
He said his father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success quietly, describing the bear as a "very important member of the family."
"He was a very quiet man, and he wasn't a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you were proud of the child even though you weren't really responsible for his success.
I think he's considering Paddington's success in that way.
Although his creation and his imagination were the work, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After her landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad was calling regularly to say that things were very bad, and she wasn't expected to get through," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got the call from Nad saying she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, love.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs she had been given by the doctors to keep her heart beating began to come to an end and leave her system.
She had died a little while before and now everything was closed down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't pray or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave."
Later and later, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, got on the plane next to the other passengers - who was unconscious of her experience.
"No one knew," he said.
I kept my head down, and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt the full feeling of sympathy for Nada.
I needed my love and my love for him.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two girls who have lost loved ones due to suicide, work to prevent others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspired messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis's son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any mother to feel the way I have to feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son is a promising cook and has a fetus.
"Everyone remembers her story.
They were always saying that his light illuminates any room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was found by his brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that that's going to have an effect again."
Ms Davis made the cards, "letting people know that there are people who can go to them and talk to them, even if they're friends.
"Don't sit still, you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, and she lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after he lost his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sad or low or anything like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we didn't notice a change in his attitude.
He had reached the bottom one Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts he made of not making any eye contact with them or anything like that."
He said his death had been a huge shock to them, but they had to come through: "He's tearing a hole through my family.
He's breaking us down.
But we all have to fight and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in the pipeline as the FBI begins to investigate
"I thought, if we couldn't get something as he was asking for - a limited investigation in terms of time, limited in terms of scope - maybe we could not ensure a bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was "afraid of the possibility of being
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their destiny is a matter of time.
There are only five weeks to go until the mid-term elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans will do poorly, then they will be significantly weakened in terms of their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the polls.
George W. Bush has been answering the phone to call Senators, urging them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr Bush at the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to come to a decision and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees 'descending' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has declined since Jim Jong-un came into force seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the united administration of the South, said there were 1,127 cases of fleeing last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the more stringent processes to control the borders between North Korea and China and the higher rates people smugglers are raising are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the people fleeing the North are finally getting South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 people from North Korea had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is a country that it is easier to cross than the highly protected Djibouti Zone between the two Koreas.
China refers to those who flee as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and it often forces them back to their own country.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is still technically at war - has improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the unclearing negotiations that had come to a halt.
This came in the wake of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a press conference on working towards the elimination of nuclear at the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho imposed U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we would not deprive ourselves of our first self-determination at all," Mr Ri told the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "aphrodisiac," saying he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "afreolis" saying he was not fit, due to the nature of his character, to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had behaved like that, I'm sure they would have called her a "rebellious," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in denying the allegations he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were in their teens.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming and crying at times while discussing his family and his time in high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying the allegations against him were "destroying his good name in a consistent and opposing way" and that was arranged by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he could not serve in the Supreme Court because his testimony shows he is biased against Democrats.
"I think it shows that it is inconsistent with those statements and the way Clinton supporters and the Democrats have accused," he said.
Peter Pelosi was asked if she would try to be confirmed, and if the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be in the Supreme Court or to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said she as a Democrat worries about Kavanaugh's possible cases against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his affirmative hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions regarding whether he would reverse the Supreme Court's specific decisions.
"Isn't this the time to have someone unreasonable and prejudiced in court waiting for us to say, 'Is that great?'" Pelosi said.
Girls need to talk about it.
It's a fair conversation, months and years of anticipation pile up, and you can't get rid of it without grumbling.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
He went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an acting officer somewhere, who said that she cries when she's angry, but that she's developed a technique and so, when she's angry and starts crying, I'll tell you not to tell the person.
I'm angry."
And then I'll carry on.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because, in essence, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest reminders I have of an early job, in an office where there were the greatest men, and I cried with anger beyond words, is an older woman grasping at the faces of my neck - a cold-hearted woman who was always - and she was always, ever, a cold-hearted, cold-hearted manager.
"Don't let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're in trouble.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a carousel outside of a marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled back from the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was very frustrated, realized there was no reason why she shouldn't think about applying for the job.
"I didn't think about the decision right," he told me by laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race already, and the last thing he needed was another one.
"Someone called us 'White Eira and the Seven Corrach.'"
Because she was late in the campaign, she was after her in terms of raising money, so she promised not to take part in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a futile battle.
She noted that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm going to get a discount?" he asked.
When she made her essay announcing that she wouldn't launch a formal campaign, her feelings went too far for her - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than voters.
"You'd think my nerves had broken," Ms. Schroeder said of the way the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my bodily sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my gravestone?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be in favor of Beijing
The first waves of the trade war between the U.S. and China were enough to deafen anyone, and although the battle is not over, a rift between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
The most significant increase introduced this week with new tariffs affecting the value of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) of items, taxing, for all purposes, half of all goods that come to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has paid the price every time and, most recently, it has imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on $600 billion of American goods.
China has promised an equal footing for U.S. efforts and only one of the world's largest economies is likely to yield soon.
Getting Washington to stop it means yielding to the demands, but public indulgence to the U.S. would raise too much shame on Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say if Beijing can get around it right, the pressure of a US trade war could support China in a positive way in the longer term by ensuring that the two economies depend less on each other.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start economic panic in both the country and elsewhere is in fact much more dangerous than the observers have previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grawyn in a statement.
Syria 'ready' to accept asylum seekers back, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready to accept asylum seekers back voluntarily and is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by seven years of war.
In a statement to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and safe, thanks to the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is working hard to rebuild the areas that have been destroyed by rioters to restore normality.
The conditions are now right for the reception of asylum seekers back to the country after they have to flee from terrorism and the damaging economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Humanitarian aid is needed for the six million people who still live in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not receive support with conditions or help from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the heels of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe managed to secure a victory as the team of Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Denmark, reached the 14.5 point required to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had a tough turnout, but when the U.S. star threw the ball in the water on the 16th par-3 hole he had to surrender the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the Italian golfer, had starred in every round, becoming 1 of the 4 players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the weakest player on paper in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top pick, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Ian Poulter of England who played more than likely in his last Ryder Cup.
And playing in his eighth Ryder Cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful players ever in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for my change and for putting his faith in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
The team is important, and I'm delighted to have been able to help," Garcia said through his tears after Europe won.
He handed over the stick to his fellow countryman John Ram who beat U.S. golf hero Tiger Woods, 2&1 in the game to the singles on Sunday.
"I was so happy to beat Tiger Woods because I grew up watching him play golf," said Rahm, a 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, meaning his record now in the Ryder Cup was 13-21-3.
And that's an odd statistic for one of the best players ever as he has won 14 championships in his career, second behind Jack Nicklaus.
And with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, the U.S. team had a hard time finding the way.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of this voice, they're fighting hard.
We had a lot of stress on Europe in the morning.
We've been fighting.
You have to pay tribute to Thomas.
He's a captain without a second.
Each of the 12 players played very well in the game.
We will fight back. I want to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Committee. We have to move forward.
I love our 12 players and am proud to be captain of them.
You have to raise your head to them.
They've played better than us."
